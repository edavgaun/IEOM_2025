0,The Implementation Of Lean Manufacturing To Increase  Productivity In A Textile Company: Case Of Study,"nowadays agile methodologies have been developed, and are used in organizations because companies face highly competitive and globalized markets with constant changes (arias, 2020). the paper is going to be based on “lean manufacturing” which is a system that aims to eliminate waste from the process through continuous and systematic improvement, without generating waste or defective products. the case of the study is based on solving the problem of low productivity for a textile company in peru, which had been caused by the excessive waiting times between operations and manual activities with a higher percentage of defective products, for example, 7% in the clothing area. in this paper first, we recollected the actual information like batches, the floor plan, production costs, etc. within we simulated the as-is and after that the as-if. this article uses the “lean manufacturing” methodology and with it, the losses of products in manual processes will be minimized, going from 10% of safety stock to 6% per order. this goal is going to achieve optimizing transfer times between areas and eliminate those activities that do not generate value for the company, using tools such as “5s”, “value stream mapping”, “acceptance control charts”, “just in time”, “process reengineering” and “simulation”. through simulation with the arena software, the results were validated, achieving an improvement in the reduction of times by 5.8% and increased productivity by 4.1% thanks to tools such as vsm, line balance, and control charts. the importance of this study is the findings can be replicated in other papers from the textile industry.","keywords: textile, lean manufacturing, productivity, safety stock","In conclusion, by implementing “Lean Manufacturing” tools (control chart, line balance, VSM, and simulation) it was possible to increase productivity by 4.1% to the total manufacturing time. It was shown that there is an inversely proportional relationship between the application of the “Lean Manufacturing” tools and the total time since, when implementing these tools, the time is reduced by 5.9%. Also, it was possible to reduce the extra margin produced by defectives from an initial 10% to a final 5% due to the application of the VSM; however, a 6% slack will be considered to cover the margin of human error. The increase in productivity with the time variable could be evidenced by simulation with the Arena software, taking an initial simulation sample of 144 units, an improvement of 19.78% of the total time was obtained, and a 51.28% improvement in the finishing area. • Increase productivity by 4.1% to the total manufacturing time. • Reduced waiting time by 5.9%. • Reduce the extra margin produced by defectives from an initial 10% to a final 5%. • Improvement of 19.78% of the total time was obtained, and a 51.28% improvement in the finishing area.","rodriguez-concha iván alberto and rosadio-vela jimena roxana bachelor of industrial engineering, faculty of engineering and architecture universidad de lima lima, lima, perú 20171332@aloe.ulima.edu.pe, 20171371@aloe.ulima.edu.pe ávalos ortecho edilberto miguel professor, faculty of engineering and architecture universidad de lima lima, lima, perú eavalos@ulima.edu.pe",
1,"A Design, Verification, And Testing (Dvt) Protocol For A  Detection System Of Acoustic Signals","detecting acoustic signals can help with daily life to a large extent. depending on a set frequency, one can detect lifesaving emergencies such as intruders or leaks (levine 1999). on top of this, once detection has been made, many different outputs can be created as a result of that detection. once an intruder comes, the system can automatically contact authorities or if a leak is detected, the system can automatically notify the user that the leak has occurred. detecting acoustic signals provides us with the comfort of being able to live more stress-free knowing that there is a system in place ready to detect an emergency at any time. the main question of our research was to come up with a system that detects acoustic signals and outputs a peak frequency after performing a high pass filtering (novick et al. 1999) of the frequency of detected sounds. in this work, we implemented a sound detection system that is fundamental to the functionality of devices such as alarm systems and medical devices. the implemented system is successful in detecting sounds. in addition, we tested the system using a simulink testing and verification system which is the first verification system to be taught in undergraduate engineering programs. it involves a sound-based verification, in which, when the test passes, a particular sound of 400-490 hz will ring. loyola university chicago is now the first university to have successfully completed dvt design verification in an undergraduate engineering program using simulink. this testing and verification system has also proved to be useful in industries and companies as simulink testing is becoming more commonly used because of its powerful model-based design and testing features.","sound, detection, labview","The simplicity of the design allows for a portable and low-risk system that can be used almost anywhere. The system could be used to detect intruders in someone’s home, water leaks from pipes in a building, or the functionality of any appliances that are supposed to make noise or that are not supposed to make noise (Cook and Ali 2012). Overall, the system is functional and extremely versatile. This sound detection system could improve functionality of devices as well as security of businesses and human lives (Sullivan et al. 1990.)

8,Evaluation Of The Particle Boards For The Construction  Projects: A Hybrid Mcdm Approach,"particleboard (pb) is an essential engineered product, which is often used as a replacement for wood, thus playing a significant role to reduce deforestation and improving environmental sustainability. proper selection of pb is important to make sure that the chosen product has the required durability and sustainability and thus can maintain the quality of the construction work. this study proposes a multi-criteria decision-making (mcdm) approach, to evaluate the selection criteria of pb to aid the decision-makers of the civil construction projects. in this approach, the existing evaluation criteria have been categorized into four criteria- physical properties, mechanical properties, chemical properties, health, and environmental impact. then a best worst method (bwm) has been used to determine the criteria and sub-criteria weights to evaluate the pbs. after that, a weighted product model (wpm) has been applied to generate the final ranking of the products to aid the decision-makers to select the right product. the study finds emission level, moisture content, and toxicity as the most weighted evaluation criteria to select a pb. for this study, the required expert feedback has been collected from the supervisors and managers of different construction firms in bangladesh. the obtained results are expected to benefit the managers, supervisors, and other decision-makers of the construction projects to select the right product for their construction projects to maintain their quality and reputation.","particle board, jute stick",,"md. tanvir siraj, a. b. m. mainul bari department of industrial and production engineering bangladesh university of engineering and technology dhaka 1000, bangladesh. tanvir25392@gmail.com, mainul.ipe@gmail.com muhammad rubayat bin shahadat department of mechanical engineering hajee mohammad danesh science and technology university dinajpur 5200, bangladesh rubayat37.me@hstu.ac.bd noor a masqur islam department of accounting information system jahangirnagar university, dhaka 1342, bangladesh. masqur.bd@gmail.com",
9,Modeling Additive Manufacturing Supply Chain  Considering Customer Product Choices,"this study proposed a utility-driven two-stage stochastic mixed-integer linear programming model to understand how the patient preferences impact the additive manufacturing (am) supply chain design decisions. the goal of the mathematical model is to maximize the utilities derived from the customer preferences by appropriately allocating the am facilities in the targeted region under customer decision and demand uncertainty. the mathematical model is visualized and validated by developing a real-life case study that utilizes the biomedical implants data for mississippi. several sensitivity analyses are conducted to understand how the patients' behavioral decisions (e.g., price-centric versus time- or quality-centric customers) to purchase biomedical implants impact the am supply chain design decisions. experimental results reveal that am supply chain is sensitive to the utility of the patients. for instance, it is observed that in addition to opening a facility in lamar county, an additional am facility is opened in washington county to serve the rural patients in our test region mississippi. the results revealed vital managerial insights that healthcare service providers and interested stakeholders could utilize to provide quality healthcare services by managing patient-centric am facility siting decisions.",choice-model,,"julekha hussain ranta graduate student, department of computational engineering mississippi state university starkville, mississippi, usa jr2507@msstate.edu raed jaradat associate professor, department of industrial & systems engineering mississippi state university starkville, mississippi, usa jaradat@ise.msstate.edu terril c. falls associate director, institute for systems engineering research (iser) mississippi state university starkville, mississippi, usa tcfalls@iser.msstate.edu",
10,Science Recommendations Based On Social Media Platforms,"social media platforms can be a source of recommendations for various items or products. digital marketing takes advantage of this potential, especially when using influencers to evaluate their items or products on social media platforms. each influencer can be a recommender of items or products. thus, one can question why this does not occur similarly in the area of science. this work presents a study in which shares/mentions were collected on a social media platform, twitter, about scientific documents (for example, journal or conference papers, thesis, reports, and patents). we pretend to obtain the polarity of these shares/mentions (positive, negative, and neutral) is obtained. it was found that most of the shares/mentions are neutral and few are considered positive, which leads to the conclusion that there are shares/mentions about science and that, despite the lack of detected polarity they can serve as a basis for a scientific recommendation.","twitter, sentiment analysis",,"jorge oliveira e sá researcher, algoritmi research center university of minho guimarães, portugal jos@dsi.uminho.pt","References

11,Agile Methodologies Based Method For The Uda-Erp  Software Implementation,"enterprise resource planning could be discussed for an organization in the sme sector due to the processes required to adopt it. on the other side, agile deployment methods contribute to reaching the development and implementation objectives based on the user experience through incremental deliverable software components. in this paper, we researched the application of the lean thinking (kanban) methodology and agile deployment methods to propose a method that collects a set of activities for its implementation. two scenarios were considered for the uda - erp software validation: i) deployment of a software module without an implementation method and ii) deployment of a software module applying the proposed method. consequently, the servqual and user experience (sus) models were considered to apply satisfaction surveys to validate the results. the research results led to generating a five stages method that involves: i) initial contact with the client, ii) requirement definition, iii) implementation in a test environment, iv) production and v) closure of the implementation project.","uda-erp, erp, lean thinking, agile methods","In the proposed method, the implementation activities planning and their monitoring provided greater control by the ERP software provider company by incorporating activities schedule and a Kanban board to control the status of each one of them. By combining Kanban with Andon, the method got a visual control of the activities and their execution status throughout the ERP software implementation, identifying activities objectively in progress or that still does not start. The activity error rate will be reduced, and the implementation process will continue following the initial planning. The results of the SERVQUAL questionnaire showed that the proposed implementation method offered the client a more excellent perception of the service quality offered by the UDA-ERP software implementation team since it involves the client in each of the deployment stages. When applying the SUS questionnaire, the usability of the proposed deployment method is evaluated by the UDA- ERP software implementation team, who experienced the benefits of the proposed method compared to the current method.","cesar mendez-johegyi and catalina astudillo-rodriguez computer science engineering school, universidad del azuay, cuenca, ecuador cmendez@es.uazuay.edu.ec, cvastudillo@uazuay.edu.ec esteban crespo-martinez engineering of production school, computer science engineering school, universidad del azuay, cuenca, ecuador ecrespo@uazuay.edu.ec ana vasquez-aguilera engineering of production school, universidad del azuay, cuenca, ecuador anavasquez@uazuay.edu.ec gabriela chica-contreras accountant and auditory school, universidad del azuay, cuenca, ecuador magaby@uazuay.edu.ec",

16,Mailroom Operation Improvement Using Simulation,"the resident students at the university of new haven have been complaining of long wait times when picking of their mails and packages from the mailroom. there is only one central mailroom operating non-holiday weekdays from 8:30 am to 4:30 pm. the mail/package dispensing is handled through one window staffed by a mail clerk who handles other mailroom tasks when no one is waiting at the pick-up window. the one waiting line for pick up grows so large at times that some students miss their classes, meetings, lunches, and other very important obligations so as to not have to come back for another waiting episode at the mailroom queue! the student authors (1st and 2nd) selected the improvement of the mailroom operation as their graduate degrees capstone projects with guidance and advising from the 3rd author. the mailroom operation was thoroughly studied and modeled using discrete event simulation with arena. some of the needed data were obtained from the mailroom management while others were collected by observation. a preliminary and first approximation of the model has already been developed, verified, and validated to mirror the actual mailroom operation on a given workday. there were multitude challenges from data availability and data integrity to the picks and valleys in demand (students’ pickups) to mail/package arrivals by different carriers. the biggest modeling challenge has been matching of the students with their packages (one or more which is probabilistic) and the team is currently working to implement that scenario. other than the scarcity of the resources, both physical (windows) and human (mailroom dispensing clerk), there appears to be job design issues, which would require further study in terms of facility design and operations management. the presentation at the conference will review the entirety of the project from data collection to model building and testing to the arena model(s), the study findings, and the recommendations for the improvement of the mailroom operation.","lean, mailroom modeling",,"asnath sethiel mosha, jack krivitsky and m ali montazer department mechanical and industrial engineering university of new haven west haven, ct, usa 06516 amosh2@newhaven.edu jkriv1@newhaven.edu amontazer@newhaven.edu",
17,Designing Supply Chain To Hedge Against Disruptions: A  Review Of Literature In General And Agro Food Supply,"recent events unveiled that it has become eminent to understand the wide dimensions of the supply chains disturbance and how to mitigate its effect on the performance. the complexity of globally stretched supply chains of different products and specifically agricultural food supply chains have increased the sensitivity of the performance if any disturbances occur. this paper reviews the literature from 2017 concerned with resilience in supply chains and agro food supply chains, with the aim of building a complete understanding of the methods and strategies to deal with disruptions. the review classifies the risks, decision variables, and objectives (with a deeper look on resilience and sustainability measures) considered for both general and agro food supply chains to reach a conclusion on the most appropriate strategies. the different model types are addressed together with the appropriate solution techniques to reach an optimum performance for the model. we identified the research gaps and highlighted the different research paths that are scarce in literature. the results show the dearth in research on agro food supply chains and application of the models on real case studies. sustainability is rarely addressed and linked with resilience. limited research addressed resilience as a performance measure although it is of great importance, while a few considered the tradeoff between financial and resilience measures.","resilience, sustainability","This study presents a review of supply chain resilience to mitigate the effect of disruption in general and agro-food supply chains and to contribute to the call of several scholars (Ana Estesoa, 2018), (Bottani, 2019), (Hosseini, 2019) and (Adbor, 2020). Although the emphasis is on getting a deeper understanding of the concept of resilience, its strategies and important aspects, this work also concentrates on how researchers introduced a resilient supply chain design, how their work was formulated and implemented, what decision variables were considered, how the work was solved to find the optimum configuration and in some cases applied on a specific chain. SCR is a disruption driven notion that requires precise configurations, thus findings reveal that numerous strategies are efficient in the face of disruptions, like scenarios to choose between the strategies and combining proactive and reactive strategy is recommended. The reactive strategy that has the most positive influence on the chain is having a capacity buffer, whereas the proactive strategy is investing in technology to provide visibility. The review proved that the decision variable is always linked to the strategy, supplier and capacity decisions are critical for designing a resilient supply chain, whereas decisions concerning the product flow have been widely addressed for ASC and showed great improvements in performance. The objective function is oriented towards the financial objective of cost minimization, and to a smaller extent, maximization of service level which is interrelated to the resilience. Critical objectives for ASC are of waste, controlling this objective reduces costs and increases resilience in most cases. Furthermore, having the objective of minimizing lead time has positive influence on the ASC resilience, the successful model for these type of chains mostly has a dual objective of financial and customer orientation. The highly successful models are the ones who dealt with the fact that disruption effect is gradual, consequently variables studied should be formulated into a two stage linear programming model that will later be optimized with the help of a software. Finally, the findings provide that a stochastic model is most commonly formulated and solution is reached by solving it on CPLEX solver in the GAMS software.","chains sherine beshara phd student, production engineering department alexandria university, egypt sherineb@gmail.com hadi fors assistant professor, production engineering department alexandria university, egypt hadifors@alexu.edu.eg nermine harraz professor of industrial engineering, production engineering department alexandria university, egypt nharraz@alexu.edu.eg hamdy elwany professor of industrial engineering, production engineering department alexandria university, egypt hamdy.elwany@alexu.edu.eg",
18,Holistic Qa: Software Quality Assurance For The Machine  Learning Era,"the traditional software space (1.0) has seen more than fifty years of creation, testing, and delivery of deterministic software, but this tradition is being disrupted by machine learning (2.0). however, ml and traditional software are considerably different, and the nascent ml industry uses unique workflows and toolsets for both life cycles. this “one foot in each raft” scenario forces companies to support duplicate resources which are essentially doing the same thing. this paper proposes an answer to the research question: can software 2.0 quality assurance be performed effectively using the same process as 1.0? a systematic literature review was performed and process documents from a machine learning company reviewed. 132 papers were selected and refined to 24. ml process documents supported what is an industry standard ml life cycle. while the literature review shows a gap relative to holistic qa solutions for ml products, process documents showed the answer to the research question is...perhaps, since it was determined that the typical ml life cycle can be mapped to the standard software 1.0 life cycle. this paper proposes using that mapping to extend an existing 1.0 qa process architecture, the quality assurance machine (qam), to effectively manage both 1.0 and 2.0 qa.","quality assurance, machine learning, software 1.0","The software industry is changing, rapidly. Software 1.0, traditional deterministic solutions that have been created for decades, is being disrupted by 2.0, artificial intelligence and machine learning. Quality assurance is not keeping pace with this rapid change. Research appears to be grasping the shiny 2.0 object, as there is a lack of quality assurance solutions for combined 1.0 and 2.0 products, which is a typical deployment of ML models. The Quality Assurance Machine (QAM) can fill this gap. Results of mapping the traditional software life cycle, RDDTR, to the ML life cycle, show an overlap which can be supported by extending the QAM. This effort would relieve ML software companies of the duplicative effort of supporting two lifecycles performing the same function.","shane downing and m. affan badar department of applied engineering and technology management indiana state university terre haute, in 47809, usa sdowning8@sycamores.indstate.edu, m.affan.badar.indstate.edu",

This study linked two Internal organizational factors with Customer Satisfaction. Those factors are Employee Satisfaction and Communication Satisfaction. Three hypotheses were tested to check those relations. The first hypothesis, which links communication satisfaction and employee, shows a significant relationship between communication satisfaction and employee satisfaction with p=0.000 with correlation coefficient = 0.774**, which means high correlation. The second hypothesis, which links employee satisfaction and customer satisfaction, shows a significant relationship between them with p=0.004 and correlation coiffeicient=0.534**, which means highly correlated. The last hypothesis, which links between communication satisfaction and customer satisfaction, shows a significant relationship with p=0.026 and correlation coiffecient=0.371 **, which means moderately correlated. So the conclusion is that for virtual organizations to increase their customer satisfaction, they should increase two internal organizational factors: employee satisfaction and communication satisfaction. And to increase their Employee satisfaction, they should increase the communication satisfaction of their employees.","manar soliman mahmoud assistant lecturer, production engineering department faculty of engineering alexandria university alexandria, egypt manar.soliman@alexu.edu.eg reem alkadeem professor, production engineering department faculty of engineering alexandria university alexandria, egypt reemkadeem@alexu.edu.eg soheir backar associate professor, production engineering department faculty of engineering alexandria university alexandria, egypt soheir.backar@alexu.edu.eg",

21,Modelling Congestion For Aggregate Production Planning In  Open Queuing Networks,"the challenge in aggregate production planning for high-tech manufacturing industries such as aerospace, semiconductor manufacturing, or high precision components production is the variability in cycle times or cycle steps due to the rework required to meet very high levels (6-sigma) of quality. this variability at the lower planning level needs to be accounted for in aggregate planning level. planning circularity, whereby cycle time depends on resource utilization while resource utilization is determined by cycle time continues to be an important problem in the aggregate planning literature. it is well known that ignoring congestion, as is the case in mrp-ii based systems still widely in use, is inaccurate. in the presence of congestion, the relationship of wip and throughput is nonlinear and bottleneck resources may shift constantly. the most common approach of addressing the nonlinear relationship between the wip and the throughput is through the clearing function. recent work by omar et al. (2017) proposed a mixed-integer linear model for closed queuing production networks using fixed release planning. the challenge with this model is that it is difficult to scale up for typically sized problems scalability. this work extends the approach in omar et al. proceedings of the 7th north american international conference on industrial engineering and operations management, orlando, florida, usa, june 12-14, 2022 © ieom society international 178",,"and Future Study In this paper, a NLP model was developed for aggregate production planning by directly inserting the formula for system throughput under the Jackson open-queuing network assumption.

22,A Comparative Analysis Of Natural And Artificial Flavorings  Through Analytical Methods And Flavor Additive,"food is a valuable commodity due to its necessity to satisfy human hunger and enable human growth. one does not frequently know what to eat and depend exclusively, on what they see and read about on a product's label, and may end up consuming unsafe flavorings and coloring. flavors are characterized by a material's sensory analysis; natural flavors generally means essential oils. artificial flavors, on the other hand, are made of various compounds that react and form a specific concentrate flavor. for the purpose of this study, natural strawberry flavors from a selected company was compared with artificial flavors created in a laboratory, using sensory, refractive index (ri) and specific gravity (sg), and consumers’ perception analyses. it was observed that both sg and ri are higher in artificial flavor compared to natural one, indicating artificial flavor to be more viscous. furthermore, the result indicated that consumers preferred natural flavor over artificial flavor.","additives, flavors, artificial, natural","and Recommendations This study focused on strawberry flavor obtained from a wholesale store compared to the artificial flavor generated in a laboratory. Flavor extraction is the most difficult procedure, due to the volatility of the chemical composition of the flavor. Most research studies used the GCMS method for extraction, which allows volatile and semi-volatiles to be injected in the equipment. Both SG and RI results for the natural strawberry flavor were lower than the artificial flavor. This is due to the fact that an artificial flavor is compounded with all different raw materials, and therefore, it is heavier than the natural flavor. The RI analysis indicated that the light that passed through the artificial flavor took additional time to be refracted. RI seemed to increase with SG for both natural and artificial flavors. Although literature shows that there are regulations that govern flavor additives, it was observed that consumers are less educated about food regulations. South Africa has governing bodies and regulations in place, that enforces flavor industries to avoid food fraud and enhance food safety. The DoH is responsible for enforcing the laws, but it is identified that the regulations are not policied. Furthermore, there are insufficient environmental Health and Safety Officers in each municipalities whom can ensure that issues such as the listeria breakout do not occur. This is a huge gap and affects consumers, even when the consumer protection service exists but do not communicate with consumers effectively. Furthermore, it was observed that very few consumers are knowledgeable when it comes to the origin of flavors, how they are derived and integrated into food to deliver quality food products. Consumers have limited knowledge on flavor education, thus it was very difficult to get honest tasting responses from untrained consumers. Nevertheless, the consumers preferred the natural sample when they tasted it. The natural flavor was perceived to be healthier as compared to artificial flavor. They concluded that the sample had a very fruity taste and aroma. They expressed that they would recommend it to be used in the processing of yoghurt. The artificial flavor had an alcohol taste and aroma, mostly due to maturity level of the flavor. 5.1 Recommendations It is recommended that food manufactures label their products such that consumers are able to understand the contents of the food product. Food manufactures should use language that is easily interpreted. Consumer protection agencies should conduct research in Africa as it is very difficult to get relevant research conducted in the continent and most consumer research findings are from an international perspective. It is also evident that artificial flavors plays a vital role in maturation levels, however this study did not consider comparing flavors using matured artificial flavor. When the sample was prepared for tasting, the flavor had not yet settled to produce rounded fruity taste and aroma, therefore it is recommended that similar studies can be conducted with an artificial flavor that has been preserved for weeks to mature and compared with the natural flavor. Natural and artificial flavors were compared using the RI and SG method with satisfactory results. However, further statistical analysis can be performed for comparison. It was also observed that consumers have little knowledge about the food they eat, its content and how it is processed, hence more research studies needs to be performed to prove to the DOH, food agencies, consumer services that consumer education is very important.","regulations sandy mosia, nita sukdeo and anup pradhan department of quality and operations management school of mechanical and industrial engineering university of johannesburg, gauteng, south africa 201248722@student.uj.ac.za; nsukdeo@uj.ac.za; anupp@uj.ac.za kemlall ramsaroop ramdass department of mechanical and industrial engineering faculty of engineering university of south africa, gauteng ramdakr@unisa.ac.za",
23,Employee Engagement And The Impact On Productivity In A  South African Fmcg Company,"disengaged employees typically cost corporations an estimated $350 billion annually. the negative effects on productivity could be caused by negative interpersonal behaviours that lower employee engagement. it was found that only thirteen percent (13%) of worldwide employees are fully engaged at work. in addition, twice as many are so disengaged that this negative behaviour is spread to other employees. alternatively, leaders who incorporate strategic employee engagement behaviours experience higher employee productivity, further reinforcing the notion that organisational productivity is largely determined by employees’ efforts and levels of engagement. cost of disengaged employees in the south african content has not been determined. it can be safely stated that with productivity levels being amongst the worst in developing economies, disengaged employees are costing the economy a substantial amount of money, which translates to over-priced products, which in-turn leads to un-competitiveness. in this challenging operational environment in south african organisations, getting employees to willingly move in a unified direction is not an easy task. moreover, getting them to remain engaged to the task at hand, is even more challenging. this study uses a case study methodology to evaluate employee engagement in a fast-moving consumer goods environment. the results shows a high correlation of employee engagement with successful, sustainable and productive organizations. this in-turn forms the foundation for organizations to leverage human capital into a truly competitive advantage. disengaged employees negatively affects productivity and overall organizational performance. therefore, employers can undertake to create an environment that invariably fosters and stimulates employee engagement.","employee engagement, productivity, fmcg, orlando","The conclusion is that the company review employee requirements and develop a CWP to improve the overall wellness of the workforce, which will see a subsequent improvement in organisational productivity. These programs are by far not a “one size fits all”, thus HR management should embark on a detailed fact-finding mission to establish the current state and plan accordingly. The research has affirmed the relationship between employee engagement and organisational performance. Evidence from both primary sources and the literature review categorically align improved business performance to employee engagement. They seem to form a symbiotic relationship and one can’t exist without the other. One can always argue that organisational performance is determined by other factors such as economic conditions, availability of technology, changes in customer or consumer preference and it would be difficult to refute this argument. What this research has shown is that organisations stand a much better chance of creating sustainable performance if their workforce is highly engaged. For the organisation in question, the researcher has made sound recommendations for management to consider as key aspects of their HR strategy. Armed with this information, the leadership can seek to improve the levels of engagement at the operational site and if implemented correctly, they should see an improvement in overall organisational performance. This strategy can be used as a blue- print to execute across other operational sites.","perumal ricki govender and nita inderlal sukdeo department of quality and operations management faculty of engineering and the built environment university of johannesburg gauteng, south africa rickigovender0508@gmail.com , nsukdeo@uj.ac.za kemlall ramsaroop ramdass department of mechanical and industrial engineering faculty of engineering university of south africa ramdakr@unisa.ac.za",

27,Assessment Of Behavioral Impacts And Socio-Economic  Status Stand Of Blockchain Games To Undergraduate,"virtual economies continue to be a global phenomenon, and cryptocurrency is prominent in this process, and it can be attained by playing blockchains. the rise of non-fungible tokens (nfts) is also increasing the demand for ethereum. thus, these features encourage many people to earn money while playing it that even young people (most likely undergraduate students) invest. there is no doubt that it is a good business for financial risk and problems, it also provides much more significant opportunities and applications. somehow the notions of blockchain technology provides some negative outcomes, specifically in the behavioral aspects of them. in this paper, the researchers focused on socioeconomic status and behavioral aspects of the players and considered these two as the factors in their perspective about the blockchain games. the results on socioeconomic shows that most of them are playing because of financial problems and sees this as an opportunity to have an income. the results on behavioral impacts through pareto analysis shows that most respondents suffer from the negative impact of playing blockchain games, 66% of the respondents has lack of sleep, 53.5% less focus in studies, 39.5% less interactive and more. tukey method is also use to analysis whether which questions is significantly important in terms of obtaining and analysis the results from the survey conducted. in conclusion the socioeconomic stand is likely to affect their perspective in the blockchain games and shows that these games can lead to addiction because of the time spend in playing, the anxiety with the game and other negative outcomes.","blockchain games, cryptocurrency, nft’s","This section discusses the conclusion based on the results in the previous chapter, which is supported by statistical tools, data from the survey, and online discussion group. In this paper, the socioeconomic status and behavioral aspects of the players were focused. The researchers considered these two as the factors in their perspective about the blockchain games. At this juncture, the socioeconomic stand of the respondents has a significant role in playing blockchain games. Despite of their socio-economic status, these players tend to earn money to help their family and for their personal wants and needs (as the respondents said in the online discussion group). Thus, their socioeconomic stand is likely to affect their perspective in the blockchain games. On the other hand, the researchers conclude that blockchain games are likely (Figure 5.1.6.) to affect the behavioral aspects of the respondents. It shows that these games can relate to other online games (such as DOTA, League of Legends, CrossFire, etc.) that can lead to addiction since they play blockchain games three (3) hours and above every day, feel anxiety with game results, annoyed when the game is interrupted, etc. The researchers also found out that internet connection may affect the behavior of player (Figure 5.1.12).

29,A Case For Solar Energy System Dashboards To Validate  Performance Warranties,"solar power generation has increased exponentially in the last decade. it is expected to play an essential role in generating renewable energy in the united states and the world in the future. one of the critical points for the return on investment of photovoltaic systems is to maximize energy generation. yet, a problem exists in that solar energy systems do not have a monitoring system for all components, so there is no way to know, in real-time, if the solar energy system is performing as expected. this study proposes to evaluate the effectiveness of the pvwatts prediction calculator compared to actual real-world data obtained from the solar energy research institute (keshena, wi). the results show that the pvwatts prediction of solar energy generation is statistically significantly different from the actual solar energy generation. moreover, the actual solar energy generation varies year by year, and the theoretical vs. actual analysis demonstrates that this system is not working according to warranty expectations. therefore, there is a need for a real-time monitoring system or another type of real-time preventive maintenance to know the performance of solar systems.","solar energy, energy industry","The purpose of this exploratory study was to test several hypotheses which ultimately are used to quantify the difference (if any) between the predicted (e.g., PVWatts) to actual (e.g., using real-time generation performance sensors) to the theoretical (e.g., using real-time temperature and solar irradiance sensors). In summary, PVWatt's prediction of solar energy generation is statistically significantly different from the actual solar energy generation. Moreover, the actual solar energy generation varies year by year. Finally, the theoretical vs. actual analysis demonstrates that this system is not working according to warranty expectations. For owners of solar energy systems, the results of this analysis are critical for (1) assessing the accuracy and decision making related to return on investment (via PVWatts prediction tool) and (2) evaluating real-world performance expectations (via on-site sensors, if available). More often than not, the “set it and forget it” approach to solar energy generation results in consumers *assuming* the return on investment and real-world performance is accurate when the data (as shown through this analysis) implies otherwise. This analysis supports the need for installing a real-time monitoring system to validate return on investment and warrantied real-world performance expectations. Like all studies, this study has its limitations. First, the study only assessed one solar energy system site. It is recommended that future research evaluate other sites which may be considerably different within the environmental factors and conditions that could affect certain derate factors such as soiling, snow, and shading, therefore, creating the potential for different results and conclusions mentioned in this study. A second limitation is that the data is restricted to 5 years. Due to climate change and several other external factors, future research should continue to assess solar energy system performance from a longitudinal perspective, utilizing as much data as possible. Third, only one type of technology (e.g. mono-crystalline silicon) was assessed in this study. Future research should consider the evaluation of new technologies including organic, premium, and thin-film technologies. Moreover, future research should consider different configurations (e.g., angle and orientation) and a variety of derate factors.","amaya mcnealey college of engineering north carolina agricultural and technical state university greensboro, nc, usa akmcnealey@aggies.ncat.edu esteban a. soto purdue polytechnic institute purdue university west lafayette, in, usa soto34@purdue.edu lisa b. bosman purdue polytechnic institute purdue university west lafayette, in, usa lbosman@purdue.edu",
30,The Economic Logic Of Open Science In Large-Scale  International Projects,"the primary purpose of this paper is to explain the economic logic of open science in large-scale international projects (lisps) in fusion-energy research by applying the mertonian norms of communalism, universalism, disinterestedness, originality, and skepticism (cudos). lisps in fusion-energy research provide an adhering case for an application of the five mertonian norms because they are on the edge between science and technology. thus, lisps can provide a fitting example of the productive balance between the community of scientists, who favor full disclosure of their results, and the community of technologists, who favor secrecy or exclusive possession of their results, as described in the new economics of science. on the side of the scientists, the publicly funded international thermonuclear experimental reactor (iter) project, currently the largest project in fusion-energy research, is a fitting example of the benefits of openness in science because all the intellectual property developed in the project is shared equally by all its seven global members. on the side of the technologists, the next phase of fusion-energy research will be most likely characterized by an influx of private funding and by a shift from open science to proprietary technologies, which can have a possible negative impact on future research due to exclusive possession. the evidence drawn from a series of interviews provides support to the main research question of this paper that science and technology policies, which favor openness in fusion-energy research, can provide greater economic and social utility to both communities.","open science, technology policy",,"marco vincenzi senior lecturer, department of economics peter t. paul college of business and economics university of new hampshire durham, new hampshire, usa marco.vincenzi@unh.edu",

32,Fine-Tuning The Parameters For Solving The Multi-Objective  D-Facts Optimal Allocation Problem,"distributed flexible ac transmission systems (d-facts) and d-facts allocation are new topics that are gaining traction in the field of power systems. the reason for this is that they are a simple yet effective tool for improving power flow control, power system flexibility, and reducing overall power systems cost by manipulating some properties of the transmission lines on which they are installed. so far, most research has focused on improving the algorithms used to optimally allocate the d-facts along existing networks in order to maximize or minimize a certain objective. however, much of this research has been based on the assumption that all the parameters are pre- defined and immutable. the key objective of this study is thus to study how the changing of different parameters may affect the final solutions found by the optimization algorithm. the key parameters studied are the line reactance adjustment limit, the number of lines on which d-facts are allowed, and the investment cost limit. results show that all these parameters have an effect on the final solution set, and decisions need to be made by carefully weighing the available resources, convenience for deployment, and the potential benefits that could be brought by utilizing d- facts devices.","power systems, d-facts, optimization","This study performed a sensitivity analysis of the D-FACTS allocation problem taking into account three key parameters relevant to network properties rather than the optimization algorithm. These parameters were the amount of reactance change allowed on transmission lines, which affects voltage stability and total transfer along the line; the maximum number of lines over which D-FACTS may be installed, which affects how many lines will receive the devices and the feasibility of having the resources to perform the installation; and finally the monetary investment limit, which affects the amount of devices which will be installed throughout the system. The effects of these parameters are measured based on the resulting changes in the objective functions of the solutions remaining in the Pareto-optimal set after running the optimization algorithm, which are summarized into best-case, average-case, and worst-case for total expected operating costs, expected Global Warming Potential, and Line Utilization Factors, which correspond to economic, environmental, and sustainable effects. The sensitivity analysis was performed mainly by the use of statistical regression analysis, with a significance level of 5% as a standard. These calculations were assisted by the use of Minitab ® software. Statistical analysis found that the reactance change limit has little impact on most of the objectives and that it is not a very significant parameter in the optimization process. On the other hand, number of lines and investment limit have a much more significant effect, with number of lines having an apparent inverse relation with most objectives, while the investment limit has a direct relation with improving the objective function values. The main drawback, however, is that investors and decision- makers may oppose increasing their investments despite obvious long-term benefits. Since each D-FACTS device has an estimated cost of $3000, and the hourly cost is calculated to be approximately 2.5 cents, an increase of $5/hr to the investment limit translates to approximately $600,000 in initial investment, which would discourage change and risk- averse executives, even despite previous studies estimating hourly savings in the tens of thousands of dollars.

37,Learning Water Quality Functions From Data For  Monitoring And Controlling Water Quality In Networks,"it is envisioned that future commercial and institutional (ci) buildings will be installed with a multitude of sensors that will provide water quality measures in real-time. since water quality does not change instantly, one needs to predict how water quality will change over time and space, and proactively control water quality using chemical additives, or removing contaminants from water, to keep its quality within the regulated safe range for drinking. therefore, the control systems must first develop water quality functions that can be used in predictive models and that can subsequently be used in a feedback control system to make optimal control decisions on additives, filtering, flushing, pressure and temperature adjustment, and other available control actions. this paper focuses on the development of these predictive models. water flow including its physical properties (temperature, pressure, etc.), its chemistry (chlorine, ph levels, etc.), and its contaminants are simulated using the easily accessible water network modeling software epanet. resultant spatial-temporal water quality data from the simulation model was used to develop macro water quality functions using nonlinear regression and machine learning methods. the computational evaluation using supervised learning shows that these models can predict the water quality well.","predictive models, machine learning",,"kia zadeh industrial engineering ph.d. student school of computing and augmented intelligence (scai) arizona state university tempe, az 85281, usa kghasemz@asu.edu treavor boyer professor school of sustainable engineering and the built environment arizona state university tempe, az 85281, usa thboyer@asu.edu pitu mirchandani professor school of computing and augmented intelligence (scai) arizona state university tempe, az 85281, usa pitu@asu.edu","References

44,An Economic Order Quantity (Eoq) Model For  Chemotherapy Drugs Using New Patients’ Arrival Rates,"the covid-19 pandemic situation and cancer burden trend lead the changes in the chemotherapy drugs demand. chemotherapy can have several cycles of administration that take months. moreover, delays can occur if the patient's physical condition is not ready to undergo the process of administration, and the data will be complete after several months. the availability of new patients' arrival data is faster than the demand data. the approach to integrating this arrival data into the economic order quantity (eoq) model is the focus of this study. the demand rate is estimated using new patient arrivals data and the constant transition probabilities. model development using infinite geometric series and validated by simulation using a spreadsheet. the results show the effectiveness of new patients' arrivals data replacing the demand data with the resulting sensitivity equivalence. inventory decisions are sensitive when new patients' arrival rates are close to zero.","chemotherapy drugs, arrival rate","This study proposes the EOQ model for CT drugs using new patients' arrival rates. The CT drug demand rate in the EOQ model is substituted by new patients' arrival rate and the transition probabilities between administration cycles using infinite geometric series. The results show arrival rate is equivalent to the demand rate, and the data on the arrival of new patients is faster to collect than the demand data. The demand data for complete CT cycles takes more than 12 weeks. Thus the proposed model can produce an inventory policy that is more responsive to changes in the future. A near-zero arrival rate will make inventory decisions more sensitive. The changes in arrival rate have the same effect on the economic lot size decisions (EOQ) changes and the total costs (TC) changes. The variability of chemotherapy drugs can be a consideration for further research. This variability can be a mixture of CT drugs for a regimen. The EOQ model is a basic model to provide basic concepts, so it needs further development to be more applicable in some areas, e.g., economic production quantity (EPQ) and multi-echelon supply chain.","victor suhandi ph.d. candidate, department of industrial and systems engineering chung yuan christian university chungli, taoyuan city, taiwan g10702408@cycu.edu.tw ping-shun chen professor, department of industrial and systems engineering chung yuan christian university chungli, taoyuan city, taiwan pingshun@cycu.edu.tw",

48,Reducing The Ergonomic Risk Level In The Production Area  Of A Manufacturing Company,"musculoskeletal disorders (msds) are considered the leading cause of occupational disability and loss of productivity. the manufacturing industry is one of the work sectors where workers are most exposed to risk factors that can cause msds. this article reports the case of workers in a manufacturing company located in tijuana, mexico. this research aims to minimize the ergonomic risk workers are exposed to in the mechanical kick press and packaging stations. rapid entire body assessment (reba) and job strain index (jsi) methods are applied to evaluate the risk levels caused by postural load and repetitive movements before and after redesigning the stations. to redesign the stations, an anthropometric study was performed on the workers. the results show that, with the design of the new press station, the level of risk caused by the postural load is reduced from 10 (high) to 1 (negligible), while the level of risk caused by repetitive movements is reduced from 13.5 (high) to 1 (low). in the case of the packaging station, the level of risk caused by postural load was reduced from 9 to 2, while the level of risk caused by repetitive movements remained at 3. it can be concluded that the correct application of different ergonomics tools allows for eliminating several risk factors.","reba, jsi, sick leave","In this research, two workstations were evaluated from an ergonomic approach to detect and eliminate risk factors that could favor the appearance of MSDS in workers. Based on the results obtained, it is concluded that the objective initially set out in this research has been achieved since the risk levels were reduced from high to low, reducing workers' exposure to factors that favor the development of MSDS. In general, this research concludes that even today, workers in the manufacturing industry in Mexico are exposed to risk factors that favor the development of MSDs. For this reason, it is recommended that further research be carried out in companies in this sector. In addition, this research validates that the REBA and JSI methods are easy to apply and allow the detection of risk factors and opportunities for improvement in the design of workstations to eliminate exposure to these factors. Due to this, and based on the results obtained in this research, it is recommended that the company apply these methods to evaluate the levels of risk caused by postures and repetitive movements in other work areas. Finally, it is concluded that the anthropometric design of workstations is a practical and efficient tool to eliminate or reduce the level of risk caused by the postural load. Therefore, it is recommended to companies, specifically managers, supervisors, and health and safety department personnel, to go deeper into the anthropometric design, know the other variables, the application process, and its advantages and disadvantages.

62,Exploring Public Knowledge Worker Well-Being  Using Rasch Model,"employees in the public sector should be service-oriented rather than profit-driven. they should be motivated by the inherent advantages and rewards of their job. therefore, the study proposes to use the rasch model analysis to examine the well-being of public knowledge workers based on job satisfaction and organizational commitment. according to the findings, public knowledge workers who are more satisfied with their jobs have higher affective commitment than those who are less satisfied. furthermore, those who are more satisfied with their jobs have a higher level of normative commitment. furthermore, dissatisfied public knowledge workers tend to have higher continuance commitment than satisfied ones. the findings indicate that, despite their dissatisfaction with the promotion system in public learning institutions, the public knowledge workers continue to perform their duties as civil servants. it is exemplified by a high level of normative commitment, a type of state-mandated faithfulness to public organizations.","well-being, job satisfaction, public sector","Employee well-being is influenced by the pleasure or displeasure gained from the job and individuals' interactions with colleagues, teammates, and supervisors. Employee well-being can be measured in positive outcomes such as job satisfaction and organizational commitment. The Rasch model describes job satisfaction among public knowledge workers at a public sector learning institution. According to the Wright Map, 48 percent of public knowledge workers are satisfied with their job assignments. In contrast, they have a high organizational commitment (51 percent). The Rasch Model also shows public sector learning institutions are most satisfied with their coworkers. It implies that they have a strong sense of teamwork. Meanwhile, The Rasch Model also shows public knowledge workers have high normative commitment. The findings imply that they are committed to the common good and civic responsibility. It also has to do with having a patriotic mindset. Being responsible for one's duties, and keeping loyal to one's country since should be customer-focused rather than profit-driven. The Rasch Model results validate the first hypotheses that there is a significant difference in affective commitment based on public knowledge of workers' job satisfaction. The second hypothesis is a significant difference in normative commitment based on public knowledge of workers' job satisfaction. In contrast, in the third hypothesis there is a significant difference in continuance commitment based on public knowledge workers' job satisfaction is statistically rejected. There are still some limitations to this study. It would be preferable to rearrange the research instruments with more items to measure each job satisfaction dimension and organizational commitment dimension for future research. It is also preferable to add more respondents from various public service sectors or other industries. It might be also interesting to have a comparative study between private and public knowledge workers.","maria grace herlina, dicky hida syahchari senior lecturer, management department binus business school undergraduate program bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia 11480 herlina01@binus.edu, dicky.syahchri@binus.edu",
63,Integrating Virtual Reality And Motion Capture In Unity 3D  For The Training Of Children With Cerebral Palsy,"this study has successfully created a virtual reality training environment for wheelchair users aimed to serve children with severe cerebral palsy and cognitive impairments. the proposed system integrates motion tracking with virtual reality technologies in real time for rehabilitation purposes. the system aims at improving the trainee motor functions allowing the caregivers to directly interact with the child using visual cues. the live motion trajectory recorded from caregivers could provide a strong interaction with patients to enhance their engagement, comfort, and enjoyment of training. the proposed system can potentially help improve the lives of dozens of children who suffer from the effects of cerebral palsy in a safe, cost-effective, and entertaining environment. cerebral palsy (cp) is one of most common diagnosed childhood motor function disabilities in united states. it affects a person’s movement and coordination of muscles to maintain balance. though many treatments do exist on the market, they can be expensive and time-consuming activities which are often beyond the means of many families. there is often the problem of limited space available for practicing the control of assistive devices in a safe manner. virtual reality (vr) technology has gained attentions as an intervention to improve motor function for the children with cp. it can provide end-users the feel that they are engaged with their surroundings with far more realistic conditions than a training program which involves only screen-based action. meanwhile, the level of task difficulty can be easily modified to effectively improve their motor function, based on the real-time feedback from task performance. in 2022, the report from birth injury help center indicated that a large percentage of children with cp have some level of hearing impairment. it directly leads to their speech and language problems, which greatly results in their difficulties to follow instructions and may result in training ineffectiveness. accordingly, motion tracking technology can be used to incorporate visual cues from the therapist within vr sessions when interacting with individuals affected by cp. unity 3d software was used to create the vr environment in this study. considering that the users will be children with cp, the training “game” was produced to simulate a moving wheelchair in an urban environment. the different therapy training levels are provided by changing the driving speed of the wheelchair and the number of obstacles in the vr environment. the individual can control the wheelchair by only steering left or right. additionally, xsens mvn system was used to capture the full-body movement of one volunteer, which was selected as the caregiver’s action for patients to follow. given the unique compatible feature of xsens and unity 3d, proceedings of the 7th north american international conference on industrial engineering and operations management, orlando, florida, usa, june 12-14, 2022 © ieom society international 502",,,"xiaoxu ji department of biomedical, industrial and systems engineering gannon university erie, pa 16541, usa ji001@ gannon.edu kristen snarski department of physical therapy gannon university erie, pa 16541, usa snarski001@gannon.edu arnon ashkenazi, ethan swierski and davide piovesan, member, ieee department of biomedical, industrial and systems engineering gannon university erie, pa 16541, usa ashkenaz001@ gannon.edu, swierski001@ gannon.edu, piovesan001@gannon.edu",

Using these engineering tools was key to achieving great results. The number of sales was doubled, while the leads needed for one sale went from 200 to 70. Thus, the improvement in sales efficiency was notorious. The standardization of the process using work tools has made it possible to organize workers, establish control measures to execute action plans at the right time and make better use of the company's resources. The process shows that engineering tools are applicable to these types of companies, if the company continues to grow it is important to continue reviewing concepts and processes to achieve the desired continuous improvement. A study of this nature was never made before. The importance of the engineering tools used in the real estate sector in a third-world country was demonstrated in the study.

73,Perspectives On Last Mile Logistics: A Sustainable  Approach,"gradually the urban freight transport to final consumers is gaining relevance worldwide, with a rapid adoption stimulated also by the global health crisis. this also brings to the attention of the world interest regarding its carbon footprint and sustainability; therefore, our objective is to present a review on the diverse ways in which it is proposed to lessen the impact of last mile logistics. for this, a systematic literature review was conducted, using the prism method and the vos viewer literature analysis tools. the analysis found a growing interest in the subject, along with proposals in every aspect of the logistics process. the main concern is the actual transportation of the items and the preferred measures to ensure sustainability were the proposals for alternative vehicles, which proved to have the greatest effectiveness in the sustainable development of logistics activities.","sustainability, delivery, urban transport, freight","It is concluded that the main obstacles in last mile logistics are found in transportation (25%), followed by gas emissions (22.6%) and waiting times (20.2%). Therefore, any proposal must be prepared to address these obstacles. Regarding the main strategies that seek to ensure the sustainability of last mile logistics is, first, the integration of digital technologies in the use of e-commerce, saw in the score of 32.1% among the items seen. Since, both in data mining, as in the different planning methods, the use of digital means eases the optimization of available resources, not only affecting the final logistics costs, but also in reducing the carbon footprint. The second proposal is about alternative transportation (31%), whose attractiveness lies in the use of renewable energies and taking pollution out of urban areas. Regarding the impediments to the implementation of new methods capable of ensuring sustainability, one of the main obstacles is operational costs, mentioned in 33.3% of the cases. Implementation stands for a first cost overrun, which for small businesses is not easy to overcome. This reason goes hand in hand with the lack of infrastructure (22.6%), which is difficult to overcome if the current business does not have sufficient income margins. It is also worth mentioning that another major factor is the lack of innovation, which can exist due to a lack of resources as well as disinterest on the part of the company. The preferred proposal among the authors includes alternative vehicles, both drones and electric vehicles, depending on the density and urban distribution of each delivery area. Where despite requiring multiple trips, it is still more sustainable compared to traditional transport. Finally, as a conclusion we can mention that the review articles have transportation as the main obstacle of last mile logistics, and the implementation of small and environmentally friendly vehicles are the most practical solution. However, operating costs and lack of infrastructure are an obstacle, but that can be solved with the use of environmentally friendly alternative transport (bicycles) associated with new digital technologies for logistics optimization.","mauricio dávila-granda, andy pedraza-la-barrera, alberto flores-perez, juan quiroz-flores, martin collao-diaz facultad de ingeniería y arquitectura, universidad de lima, lima, perú 20161933@aloe.ulima.edu.pe, 20071741@aloe.ulima.edu.pe, alflores@ulima.edu.pe, mcollao@ulima.edu.pe, jcquiroz@ulima.edu.pe",
74,System Analysis And Design Of Hotel Information System  Using Design Thinking Methodology,"the philippines is one of the world's most well-known tourist destinations, with hotels and services located all over the country. due to the current pandemic crisis's demands, hotel management's current system has struggled to keep up with the new normal, resulting in significant changes and the loss of some business scope and profit. the researchers used design thinking to empathize with the people, identify the problem, and create solutions that resolved the difficulties and customer experience at the hotels. in conducting the methodology, there was a significance related to health limitations and mandated protocols, manual registration, waiting time, a shortage of staff and workloads, customer satisfaction, and advertising, which were the most prevalent difficulties in the current manual process of hotels and most of the computerized hotel systems that were experienced by using the first design thinking method, empathize. the researchers utilized personas, points of view (povs), and how might we (hmws) to identify the results through the problems and needs from the general idea of the empathizing method. the results of using the design thinking methodology were having an improved system with an efficient database and information systems design regarding hotel management with the emergence of compliance on health protocols and requirements, lessened waiting time, efficient workplace, customer satisfaction, and effective advertisement were attained. therefore, the researchers conducted system planning, analysis, and design by addressing challenges in developing functionality design into the user interface, aided by reports and interviews with hotel employees and customers.","automated system, hotel reservation, database, user interface","The customers, employees, and owners continuously demand improvements on their current system, mainly due to the pandemic that forces them to adjust and work on changes that would not affect their profit, satisfy the customers, and maximize the workforce. The researchers chose the hotel management system to aid in restoring tourism, supporting businesses and business people and strengthening the pandemic's economies. To do this, researchers plan to focus on identifying gaps and possibilities while establishing hotel management processes and improving the system's design. The researchers concluded that the design thinking methodology aided them in recognizing the problem and solving it by planning to create a design for a proposed system. It challenges assumptions to create innovative functionalities relevant to the beneficiaries' demands. The method relies on how people interact with their environment, what might be the situation today, such as a pandemic, and how people use the current system, as well as their feedback and experiences, which allows researchers to recognize a hands-on approach in determining a specific functionality for specific problems. To further identify, compulsory health restrictions have been developed due to the pandemic, which the researchers addressed by employing QR codes to identify and certify immunization. It should be introduced to remove physical contact in conjunction with the current use of paper and pen discouraged.

76,Review Of Indonesia’S Residential And Demographic Carbon  Emission Using Stirpat Model,"stirpat model is employed to review indonesia's carbon emission's residential and demographic aspects. indonesia is on its way to combat carbon emissions. indonesia is the fourth most populous country in the world, with the current population reaching 275 million in 2020. the country also faced massive economic growth following the growth of population, positioned at 7th in terms of gdp. with the current growth in population and economy, it is needed to identify whether this growth, which also induced by the decision of the population in expanding their family members, could influence the increase of the nation’s carbon emission. the effect of some aspects not included in the official government plan, namely population, economy, and residential aspect, is included in the estimation model. household energy consumption is one of the most significant contributors to indonesia's energy-based emissions. therefore, this paper tries to see whether population size and household could impact indonesia's carbon emissions. due to multicollinearity detected on the ols estimation of the stirpat model, the model is regressed the second time using ridge regression. the result shown that non-dependent population (dep) > economic inequality (gini) > energy consumption (ec) > total population (tp) > urbanization (u) > household energy consumption (hec) > gross domestic product (gdp) > household expenditure (exp) > family size (fam) > total fertility rate (tfr). it is then found that the economic aspect is the most significant contributor to the carbon emission increase. therefore, suggestions regarding carbon emission could focus on improving the economy, especially improvement in green industrialization and economic equality for the population. however, mitigation from population aspects could not be overlooked, as the population aspect contributes to driving the increase of carbon emission.","stirpat, carbon emission, anthropogenic, ols","Indonesian carbon emission drivers could be illustrated through STIRPAT analysis. The non-dependent population affects carbon emission increase the most. Though so, the economic aspect (GDP per capita, household expenditure, and Gini index) play the contribute the most to the increase of Indonesia’s carbon emission, followed by the energy aspect (total energy consumption, household energy consumption), and lastly the population (total population, urbanization, TFR, and average family size). Non-dependent population, which is the productive population plays a big role in pushing the country’s economy forward. Improvement in the economy could then improve technology, thus increasing industrial production and energy usage (Yang et al. 2021).

79,Supply Chain Coordination Under Retail Competition:  Literature Review And Research Opportunity,"in retail competition, coordination between suppliers and retailers to match the supply and demand is the key to increasing the overall supply chain profits. to ensure the achievement of the coordination objectives, a mechanism is needed that can guarantee profits for all supply chain members. this paper will provide an overview of the supply chain coordination mechanism when there is competition between retailers. this review will focus on two things, namely, supply chain coordination and competition between retailers that are influenced by promotional strategies and customer preferences. this study can provide information related to the existing supply chain coordination literature and retailer competition so that it can provide an overview of the limitations of research on supply chain coordination in retail competition.","cooperation, enterprises, retail competition, pricing strategy","Through the explanation in this paper, we get a sufficient initial description regarding the supply chain coordination literature review when retailers are competing. Through this paper, there are also research gaps that become opportunities for further research. Exploration studies were carried out by mapping the previous literature on two topics, namely supply chain coordination and retailer competition, and retailer competition through pricing strategy and customer preference. Research in this area will be further developed by considering several factors that have not been explored in this paper such as capacity limitations, joint lot sizing, and other related factors.","dewi rahmasari department of industrial and systems engineering institut teknologi sepuluh nopember (its) surabaya, indonesia dewirahmasari.19024@mhs.its.ac.id niniet indah arvitrida department of industrial and systems engineering institut teknologi sepuluh nopember (its) surabaya, indonesia niniet@ie.its.ac.id",

81,"Factors Affecting The Usage Of Online Booking Sites:  Comparative Analysis On Agoda, Booking, And Hotels","online booking sites operate like any other e-commerce platform. travel agencies buy rooms from hotels and sell them to customers, which are the travelers. as customer satisfaction is one of the main goals of the hospitality industry, it is vital to know the implications of what satisfies a traveler using an online booking site. though studies on online booking sites are limited, the study would investigate this research gap. thus, the research study aims to explore the importance of online booking and its implications on customer satisfaction and on the hospitality industry, particularly the hotel industry. to do this, the researcher assessed three online booking sites, mainly: agoda, booking, and hotels. a questionnaire was conducted to survey 165 respondents who had experiences in online booking. using the data from the survey, the three online booking sites and the survey data undergone assessment of their current systems, anova test, correlation analysis, multiple regression analysis, risk assessment, and benchmarking. it was found out that the three online booking sites have their similarities and differences in the factors identified in the research study. these subfactors that are under hotel rental price, hotel rating, hotel location, e-service quality, and interface prove to be important.",,"In this study, the researcher assessed the current systems of travel agencies. The researcher has concluded that all the sites have their difference in offers of hotel rental price, approach in reviewing and rating a hotel, map interface of a hotel location, approaches in their e-services, and designs of an interface. While there were differences, the similarities lie in the purpose of their functionalities. Ultimately, their goal was to get the best out of the online booking experience. For confirmation, the researcher performed various comparative tools and analyses. The SWOT Analysis found out that all the online booking sites have their differences in strengths and weaknesses. One of which is the reward systems they utilize for their customers. However, they have similarities in opportunities and threats. All the sites could improve their interface design, increase partnership, intense competition, especially in rental prices and travel restrictions. A total of 165 respondents participated in the survey. Most of them were middle-aged females who work in the health and wellness department; this also means that they have a stable job and monthly income, making them legible for the survey. Through observation, Filipinos seem to know about Agoda and Booking, but less about Hotels. Agoda also had the most respondents that reviewed its site than the other two, Hotels being the lowest. Most of the respondents reasoned that they use the website because it provides complete information and detail regarding the accommodations they are trying to find. Though most of them answered that they occasionally book online, respondents’ reason that it is due to the current pandemic faced when this study was conducted. Moreover, respondents discovered the online booking site they come to familiarize themselves with by their search, and others through an advertisement made by the travel agency.

82,Development Of A Forecasting Tool To Address High  Percentage Of Breach In Delivery Times,"online food delivery services (fds) have increased in popularity in the past few years. timely delivery of food is crucial as it affects the quality of food and customer attitude towards the service. this study aims to address the orders that fail to deliver within the target lead time (breach orders) due to the non-optimal assignment of riders. this study proposes a method for determining the riders to assign per area from the demand through a simple forecasting tool. current studies have already identified the factors that contribute to rider output. this study analyzes these factors to make a formula to calculate the rider output. in addition, the researchers will investigate the effect of new products and seasonal promotions on demand through a review and statistical analysis of historical data. this study contributes simple program that calculates the number of riders to assign based on user input.","delivery riders, demand","Given that the company utilizes a third-party hiring service for their riders, the best approach was found to be a forecasting tool to help in the workforce management. The main cause of the high percentage of breach was found to be the Ready to In Transit process which, according to related literature, is solved by having the right number of riders per area at a given time. The forecasting tool is able to output the number of riders to be assigned given the variables that any typical Food Delivery Service will be able to provide based on their respective situation and context. Demand and Rider Output was found to be the variables needed to identify the number of riders to be assigned per area. It was also found that the Regular and Seasonal Demand should be considered in forecasting the demand per area. This information provides a possible improvement to the way the company forecasts demand. This study has identified the variables affecting rider output relative to the distance from the store to the customer that will be used in the forecasting tool. It is recommended to use the demand of the current week separated into peak and non-peak hours for a specific area to be input into the program before the beginning of the next week to be used for optimal rider assignments in the area of next week. It is recommended to deseasonalize the demand before having its input in the forecasting tool. This will remove seasonal patterns in the time-series data to provide more or less regular demand data as the basis of the rider to be assigned per area. It is recommended to gather data on the average distance of a customer to the store as a deterministic approach.","in a local food delivery service tomas gabriel n. domingo, noah p. hermogenes, nikko e. yuag, engr. carlos ignacio jr. p. lugay, ph.d., pie, asean eng. department of industrial engineering, faculty of engineering university of santo tomas españa blvd., metro manila, philippines tomasgabriel.domingo.eng@ust.edu.ph, noah.hermogenes.eng@ust.edu.ph, nikko.yuag.eng@ust.edu.ph, cplugay@ust.edu.ph",
83,Improvement Proposal Applying Standardized Work And  5'S To Reduce The Rate Of Returned Orders Of A Poultry,"over the last few years, the poultry sector has positioned itself advantageously in the peruvian market since it contributes 56% of the animal protein consumption demanded by the population. this represents annual sales of around 11,000 million soles, which corresponds to 29% of the agricultural gdp. based on the above, companies in this sector must be at the forefront to satisfy the growing demand of this product and avoiding customer dissatisfaction, since this reduces the profitability indexes generating economic loses. part of these considerations is to reduce the 8.99% rate of order returns of a poultry company located in the south of peru through a proposal that uses 5s tools and work standardization structured under the pdca cycle. after the annual simulation of both models through the arena software, the average error rate of the orders was reduced by 55.71%, the documentation search time by 44.04% and the order cycle time by 77.90%, all of them compared to their initial value. resulting in a significant reduction to 4.95% of the order return rate.","standardized work, 5s, pdca cycle",,"company under the pdca cycle danitza silva-campusano, dayana vega-romero, alberto flores-pérez, juan quiroz- flores and martín collao-diaz facultad de ingeniería y arquitectura, universidad de lima, lima, perú 20171475@aloe.ulima.edu.pe, 20172925@aloe.ulima.edu.pe, alflores@ulima.edu.pe, jcquiroz@ulima.edu.pe, mcollao@ulima.edu.pe","References

The project experienced a delay of 5 weeks when compared to the plan (5th to 21st weeks have SPI < 1) , this also resulted in the actual project costs exceeding the budget (CPI 0.77 and CV -Rp57,052,400) due to costs such as employee salaries, equipment rental, and so on increase because the project lasts longer than planned. Overall, the project has an unsatisfactory performance when compared to the plan because the project has been delayed for 5 weeks and has a CPI value of 0.77 (over cost). The lowest CPI (the most over cost) is in the 8th week with a value of 0.65 and the lowest SPI (the most behind schedule) is in the 13th week with a value of 0.59, while the highest CPI (the most under cost) is in the 2nd week. with a value of 1.22 and the highest SPI (most ahead of schedule) was in the 1st week with a value of 2.47. The solution that can be used to improve project work in the future is to increase work effectiveness , for example by implementing a workday change program at a time that is considered not optimal for low CPI problems (worth less than 1) and doing overtime (increasing working hours) or adding a team workspace consisting of a workspace (work desk), tools in the form of a laptop and scanner, as well as HR (operators) for low SPI problems (worth less than 1). This paper can be used as an evaluation to the company for project archives arrangement and digitalization in the future so it could run according to plan and have a good performance. In this paper there are no optimization regarding the amount of overtime or additional work teams needed to improve the SPI value, waste analysis, and have not taken into account the quality aspect, so this final project can be developed again regarding further amount calculations of overtime or additional work teams needed to improve the SPI value optimally, analyze the waste of archives arrangement and digitalization project in the pandemic era and other related topics.

91,Operational Factors Analysis And Performance Values Of  Green Manufacturing At Brewing Company,"the competition in the manufacturing industry continues to increase, along with the shifting demand of consumers who are increasingly aware of environmental sustainability. in order for companies to be able to profit and compete competitively but also pay attention to environmental factors, one of the most important things that needs to be done is to develop the concept of green supply chain management in business processes. gscm is defined as environmentally friendly activities, which include green procurement, green manufacturing, green distribution, and reverse logistics. green manufacturing is one of the most important concepts that must be considered by companies as a form of response to environmental issues. this study aims to analyze green manufacturing activities at one of brewery in indonesia using the green scor model. the result of the study shows that green activities in the brewery include management of clean water sources, energy savings, and waste minimization concepts such as reduce, reuse, and recycle. based on the result of the study, it was determined that the company's performance measure in terms of green is 62.37. it means that the company's performance is included in good category. however, 6 of the 17 kpis need improvement. improvements can be made by forming a manufacturing excellence team that will conduct an audit every 3 months.","green scor, global warming","The objective of this research was to analyze green manufacturing activities at a brewery in Indonesia using the Green SCOR model. There are 17 KPIs that have been identified that are used to measure green manufacturing activities. Because each object has a different weight, the calculation of KPIs is done by normalization, namely Snorm de Boer normalization. After normalization, the data calculation of the achievement from KPIs is carried out by compiling KPIs based on the traffic light system. A traffic light is a method used to measure the activity of a performance. The measurement process is based on color indicators. There are green, yellow, and red. The result was determined that 4 KPIs were in very good condition, 7 KPIs were in good condition, and 6 KPIs were in poor condition. The results of the study showed that the company's performance measure in terms of green was 62.37 that means the company's performance was included in the good category. However, from the 17 KPIs, there are 6 that need improvements. Improvements can be made by forming a manufacturing excellence team that will conduct an audit every 3 months. This research has both theoretical and practical contributions. On the other hand, the insights from the enabler factors indicate that the support and commitment from top management to implement the environmentally friendly production process is very necessary. Further research is highly recommended to further validate the outcomes of this study.","using green scor method - a case study danang pinardi putra industrial engineering department binus graduate program - master of industrial engineering bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia 11480 danang.putra001@binus.ac.id rienna oktarina industrial engineering department bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia 11480 rienna.oktarina@binus.ac.id alfonz lawrenz kilay industrial engineering department binus graduate program - master of industrial engineering bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia 11480 alfonz.kilay@binus.ac.id","References (SCOR).

92,Combinatorial Optimization Of Various Placement Machines  For Pcb Assembly Lines,"surface mount technology (smt) has been widely used in the electronic assembly industry's printed circuit board (pcb) assembly line. the assembly line consists of several stages, including solder paste printing, component placement, reflow, and inspection. compared with other processes, component placement is a vital process. however, the placement machine in the component placement process is more expensive and is a bottleneck process in most cases. therefore, properly utilizing the machine is crucial for optimizing the entire pcb assembly system. due to the excessively high equipment configuration cost in the past, the combinatorial optimization problem of the different placement machines (including chip size, height, the accuracy) was less considered. as a result, the machine will be underutilized because the past combination mode cannot efficiently fulfill the placement requirements when demand or design changes. nowadays, the placement machine towards modular design lets the configuration time be less time- consuming than traditional. it only takes a few working days to complete the multi-line reconfiguration. therefore, this research will consider multi-level capacity planning, referring to the domestic electronic assembly industry. comprehensively provide a suitable machine combination according to market demand. proposed a matheuristic methodology that product and component assignments are carried out through the mathematical model, and the heuristic algorithm quickly solve the large-scale machine combination problem. this research combines theory and practical applications, hoping to effectively improve pcb assembly lines to reduce idle waste, thereby enhancing the competitiveness of the electronic assembly industry.",,,"james c. chen professor, department of industrial engineering and engineering management national tsing hua university hsinchu, taiwan, r.o.c james@ie.nthu.edu.tw tzu-li chen associate professor, department of industrial engineering and management national taipei university of technology taipei, taiwan, r.o.c chentzuli@gmail.com yu-jie chang department of industrial engineering and engineering management national tsing hua university hsinchu, taiwan, r.o.c changyujie0809@gmail.com",
93,Sustainable Plastic Waste Management Using A System  Dynamics Approach,"the exponential population growth coupled with rapid industrialization and urbanization triggered enormous generation of municipal solid plastic waste (mspw). the massive generation of mspw, coupled with the poor management, have caused significant negative impacts on the environment. recently, a variety of mspw management measures, such as source separation and plastic reduction, have been developed worldwide to guide mspw management systems towards sustainability. hence, developing a sustainable mspw management system, through the application of advanced waste measures, is important for future sustainable development. however, sustainable mspw management systems have not been well addressed in the literature. therefore, this study aims to develop a generic system dynamics (sd) model to study the sustainable mspw management. this is achieved through forecasting the effects of sustainable measures, namely source separation policy, recycling process, and incineration with energy recovery technology on mspw management and amount of ghg reduction. the proposed model is implemented on a case study of mspw management system in dubai to assess its applicability and effectiveness. vensim® software is used to stimulate and analyze the model through testing five different scenarios. the simulation results indicated that scenarios hslrwi and lshrli perform best in terms of the amount of plastic waste recycled, scenario lswrhi leads to the highest amount of ghg reduction, and scenario lshrli gives the highest amount of incinerated plastic waste with energy recovery and least amount of plastic waste landfilled. therefore, the proposed model helps decision makers in choosing the scenario that works best according to their strategies and goals.","system dynamics, commercial","Developing a sustainable MSPW management system, through the application of waste measures and policies, is important for future sustainable development. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the impact of multiple sustainable waste measures and policies on MSPW management and GHG reduction amount. To achieve this goal, a generic SD model is developed by integrating three waste measures, namely source separation policy, recycling process, and incineration with energy recovery technology in the MSPW management system. Vensim® software is used to develop the proposed SD model. To test the impacts of these sustainable measures, five different scenarios are conducted taking into account different implementation levels for the three measures. The simulation results indicated that scenarios HSLRWI and LSHRLI perform best in terms of the amount of plastic waste recycled, scenario LSWRHI leads to the highest amount of GHG reduction, and scenario LSHRLI gives the highest amount of incinerated plastic waste with energy recovery and least amount of plastic waste landfilled. Therefore, the proposed model helps decision makers in choosing the scenario that works best according to their strategies and goals. For future studies, other waste management measures, such as plastic reduction policy, are planned to be tested. The economic impact of integrating sustainable waste measures and policies may also be studied in the future. In addition, it is anticipated to apply the proposed generic SD model to other cities to help them evaluate the impact of multiple measures and policies on their MSPW management.","marwa al nahlawi, sameh al-shihabi and ridvan aydin department of industrial engineering & engineering management university of sharjah sharjah, uae malnahlawi@sharjah.ac.ae, salshihabi@sharjah.ac.ae, raydin@sharjah.ac.ae",

97,Determining Factors Of Financial System Stability (Fss)   In Indonesia,"the purpose of this study is to identify the factors that cause financial system instability. this study uses the profitability model which is represented by return on assets (roa) as an indicator of financial system stability (fss) as well as the dependent variable. as for the independent variables, this study uses the capital adequacy ratio (car), non-performing loans (npl), composite stock price index (ishg), and assets. the data used in this study were cross-sectional variables between 2015-2019, which were processed using the econometric model of panel data regression analysis and eviews 9.0. research findings indicate that car and npl have a significant influence on the creation of fss through the profitability model.",,"The results of this study indicate that CAR and NPL have a significant influence on the creation of FSS through the profitability model. This finding further confirms the decision of the IMF and the Basel Committee to include these two indicators as a measure in assessing FSS. Given that CAR and NPL are important indicators in the creation of FSS, their implementation must be supported by a strict individual and macroprudential monitoring system by OJK and BI. Banks must be encouraged to continue to increase their level of capital, on the other hand, they must be monitored so that they have a low NPL. These two policy mixes are expected to maintain FSS in Indonesia. FSS is actually something complex. As a system, the FSS does not only consist of banking, but also various other financial institutions. Therefore, further research is recommended to involve non-bank financial institutions either individually or jointly. BIBLIOGRAPHY Baltagi, Badi H. (2013). “Econometric Analysis of Panel 5th Ed.”.

108,"Failure Analysis Process Leadtime Reduction In A  Manufacturing Company Through Eliminate, Combine,","reducing process lead time is one of the manufacturing industries' challenges to boost productivity and minimize the time required to develop new products. one of the processes that may improve further during new product development is the failure analysis process. it is finding the root cause of a failure to address the issue and prevent future failures. the failure analysis process of company-abc, a hard-disk drive manufacturer, was evaluated in this study to optimize the process and reduce investigation lead time by fifty percent. a shorter investigation lead time benefits the company since it enables faster discovery and correction of errors, hence expediting the development of new products. process improvement can be achieved in various ways, one of which is by applying ecrs concepts (eliminate, combine, rearrange, and simplify), which involves eliminating insignificant activities, combining or rearranging the order of related activities, and simplification of activities. the va/nva (value added and non-value added) and 5m1e (man, machine, method, material, measurement, environment) analysis can help determine which tasks have opportunities for improvement and optimization through ecrs. company-abc was able to halve the duration of the investigation by utilizing the ecrs concepts. all activities that underwent ecrs were discussed with the process's team members to ensure that all potential effects were understood before implementation. finally, issues that develop due to process optimization will be monitored and documented constantly to help pinpoint specific areas in need of further improvement.","process design, leadtime reduction, va/nva, 5m1e","Based on the result of the VA/NVA and 5M1E analysis, and the impact of the ECRS concepts on the process, it can be concluded that under the new process flow, the Failure Analysis Engineering Group of the Product Design Support Department of Company-ABC improved its investigation lead time and met the target of fifty percent reduction. With process improvement, the new lead time for the investigation was reduced to 529 minutes with nineteen steps. The significant improvement is primarily due to the simplification concept of ECRS, which led to the development of an excel macro to automate the manual log data analysis and script creation steps. These process improvements also eased and lessened the members' fatigue since the repetitive activity was simplified. It would be helpful for future research if processes associated with the FA group, such as Teardown Group, were also subjected to the same study since this would expedite the analysis and correction of failures encountered during new product development.","re-arrange, and simplify (ecrs) concept gerlyn calica altes, klint allen a. mariñas, michael n. young, and yogi tri prasetyo school of industrial engineering and engineering management mapúa university 658 muralla st., intramuros, manila 1002, philippines gcaltes@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, kaamarinas@mapua.edu.ph, mnyoung@mapua.edu.ph, ytprasetyo@mapua.edu.ph klint allen a. mariñas and yung-tsan jou department of industrial and systems engineering chung yuan christian university taoyuan city, taiwan klintallen2011@gmail.com, ytjou@cycu.edu.tw reny nadlifatin department of information systems, institut teknologi sepuluh november, kampus its sukolilo, surabaya 60111, indonesia reny.nadlifatin@gmail.com",
109,Classification Of Printing Ink Quality Based On Pigment  Dispersion Process: A Case Study,"pigment dispersion process is the most crucial process in printing ink manufacturing. a multinational printing ink manufacturing company produces ink through semi-finished or intermediate products prior to finished ink production. pigment concentrated is an intermediate with the most complex manufacturing process in the company because it involves a pigment dispersion process. during the 2019-2021 period, the right first-time rate of pigment concentrated was below than 70%. along with technological developments, the use of data mining methods in the industrial world has been widely studied. the objective of this study is to classify printing ink quality based on the pigment dispersion process by bead mill with cart using historical production parameter and quality data from a multinational printing ink manufacturer. this research was conducted using the qm-crisp-dm framework by schafer et al. (2018). the data was obtained from the production logbook and the company's erp database from 2019 to 2021 period. the model was made using 18 independent variables and particle fineness status as target variable with (0) as defected and (1) as not defected. this study shows that the fineness of printing ink is highly affected by temperature of pass 1 during the production. the decision rule to reduce defect in pigment concentrated production process is also proposed. the use of the over-sampling method on training data and the entropy criteria has the highest accuracy.","cart, printing ink, beverages","The pigment concentrated quality is crucial for printing ink quality because it provides color for print-ready ink. However, the pigment concentrated production process is often challenging because of many factors involved. The objective of this research is to construct model and analyzed process parameter with lowest defect rate with Decision Tree. CART was used as decision tree algorithm. SMOTE was used to balance the data and the best parameter was determined by means of GridSearchCV in order to obtain high accuracy. The model with sophisticating accuracy was constructed parameter as follow, Entropy as splitting criterion, minimum sample per leaf is 2, and maximum tree depth is 7. Temperature during Pass 1 became the most important feature in this model which stand as root node in decision tree visualization. From material quality aspect, varnish with higher solid content and lower viscosity is more desired to achieve lower defect rate. QM-CRISP-DM was helpful to solve printing ink industrial problem using Data Mining approach. For future work, the methodology in this research can be proposed to improve products that was produced using vertical bead mill and widen for the other pigment concentrated with different color index. Each pigment has its own characteristic and this model could be not applicable for the other pigments. Therefore, new model development is necessary to improve the other product quality","muhammad sopyan yahya and isti surjandari department of industrial engineering faculty of engineering, universitas indonesia kampus ui, depok 16424, indonesia muhammad.sopyan@ui.ac.id isti@ie.ui.ac.id",
110,Human Cognitive Behavior And Its Effects In Production  And Quality Control Activities,"to provide an exceptional product or service to the consumer on time, a production and regular quality control process are essential to avoid errors that could compromise the timeliness and quality of an entire batch. this is where the human aspect intervenes in relation to the machine, to ensure that all parameters are respected. and with such industrial development of the new generation that is aimed to facilitate even more the task of production and quality control. the role of the operator and the inspector is to define, scan and visually search the process in progress, so at the end decide to accept or reject the product / service. the decision making depends initially on human reliability in performing this task with a significant error rate. human error is an inappropriate reaction that leads to anomalies and defects in the organization, it is considered a major factor in reliability and the cause of loss of human performance. several factors influence human reliability and lead to errors, and by the same effect they generate human cognitive behavior. the cognitive-behavioral approach aims to help operators to cope with the external environment and to better integrate into industrial environments of any kind. in this regard, we study human cognitive behavior in order to better understand its features, weaknesses and potentials. with this neuropsychological knowledge, we propose the best methodologies to optimize the performance of human reliability and achieve the required productive and qualitative aspect.","humain riability, human error, cognitive behavior",,"hanan majri department of industrial engineering and management systems, numerix laboratory, university of quebec, école de technologie supérieure, 1100, notre dame street west, montreal, quebec, canada h3c 1k3 hanan.majri.1@ens.etsmtl.ca jean-pierre kenne mechanical engineering department, numerix laboratory, university of quebec, école de technologie supérieure, 1100, notre dame street west, montreal, quebec, canada h3c 1k3 jean-pierre.kenne@etsmtl.ca",

The dimensions of Physical Facilities (F) consist of the attributes of Availability of type and number of learning equipment in PKBM documents (F1), as well as Availability of the existence of PKBM office and study room infrastructure: type/length/width/number of rooms/room area documents (F3). The Academic dimension (A) consists of the Availability of syllabus documents for each program held by PKBM (A1), as well as the Availability of Learning Implementation Plan (RPP) documents for each program held by PKBM (A2). The proposal for improving the quality of PKBM education in West Java, especially for those accredited B, is with three corrective actions in order of priority: Activating discussion forums for heads of institutions and tutors so that they can share management practices in each PKBM institution, increase assistance in the procurement of facilities infrastructure for PKBM, as well as providing training on making RPP on a regular basis for PKBM teachers. For future research, it can be done on PKBM accredited C or not accredited (TT) and in a wider area scope. This research shows that in PKBM accredited B the average internal condition is good enough so that external improvements are more expected. It is possible that accredited C and TT-PKBM will show different results. In terms of methods, other EduQUAL gaps can be used, for example from the scope of the customer or even by tracing the use of improvement methods other than EduQUAL, IPA, and QFD.","based on accreditation during covid-19 pandemic hilmana radhia putera and zulfa fitri ikatrinasari industrial engineering department, faculty of engineering universitas mercu buana meruya, jakarta, indonesia rphilmana@gmail.com, zulfa.fitri@mercubuana.ac.id",

Once the results of the different improvements made in the production area have been analyzed, we can conclude by mentioning the importance of seeking continuous improvement in the processes. The development of this project demonstrates that with the use of DMAIC tools aided by experts in the process and with the help of tools such as SIPOC and Line Balancing, to mention a few, we can direct the efforts of a work team towards the fulfillment of continuous improvement. There are different methodologies and tools to solve problems and acquire knowledge, so we must always take into account all solution options, keeping in mind the technical and economic feasibility. This also forces us to make the necessary considerations about which techniques to apply depending on the complexity of the problem. During the evaluation process in the ACIST area, which had an insufficient production capacity to cover the new demand of the Customer, it was decided to make an improvement proposal supported by the DMAIC methodology in order to increase the production capacity of the ""ATP Hand Controller"" line. A line balance was performed to detect which were the workstations with bottlenecks and focus on them to reduce cycle times of operations, also applied tools such as the 5 whys and Pareto diagram to find the root cause and based on these results, implement improvements. Documentation and organization were key to the completion of this project, the organization to perform the tasks in a timely manner if any activity was delayed efforts or resources were added if it was in the critical path, for the part of documentation everything must be recorded for future audits. In all projects there will be pressure to release them in the established time or reduce the execution time of certain faces, as well as trying to reduce costs, however it is important to remember that it is not convenient to deliver a project on time and with lower cost if it does not work or if the final patient runs any risk, quality is everyone's responsibility and this responsibility is in the organization and in the staff that executes the validation.

125,Procurement Costs Optimization In The Construction  Industry With Critic-Edas Approach And Transhipment,"in the past decade, construction supply chain management (cscm) has become a considerable concern, because the cost of materials and material-related activities in most construction projects accounts for 50% to 60% of the total project costs. where material costs are mostly paid to suppliers, supplier selection is one of the most important issues in running a supply chain system. construction materials procurement and management activities play a role in responding to the challenges of reducing inventories, speeding up deliveries, and lowering overall project costs. this study proposes supplier selection with a multi-criteria decision-making method (mcdm) approach, as well as transportation planning with a transhipment model that is suitable for the construction industry. the hybrid mcdm strategy is applied sequentially by combining criteria importance through inter-criteria correlation (critic) and evaluation based on distance from average solution (edas) to get more effective results and get some of the best suppliers from the available options, which will then be simulated routes cost-optimized transportation using the transhipment model. this research will produce optimal procurement costs and show the relationship between supplier selection and material transportation to overall procurement costs in the construction industry.","procurement, critic, edas","Based on the research that has been done, it can be concluded that the results of data processing show the ranking of each supplier against each criterion affecting the final ranking. The analysis stage of supplier selection using CRITIC- EDAS with transportation optimization analysis of the transhipment model with an arrangement of 21 suppliers shows similar final results, where at the supplier selection analysis stage there are similarities in K3 criteria, relatively large production capacity and K6 criteria, relatively cheap product prices. The results of the optimization of the transhipment model of transportation with the composition of 21 suppliers also show that the two top-ranked suppliers are included in the three shipments with the highest volume. The criteria for K1, K2, K4, K5, and K7 show a less significant effect on the transportation optimization analysis of the transhipment model. The transportation optimization of the transhipment model compared to the direct transport model in this study shows that the transhipment model is more efficient in terms of transportation costs. This is influenced by the lower transportation costs per unit of material due to the larger load capacity of the fleet used from the transhipment point to the construction project site. However, in terms of time, the transhipment model takes longer to complete the transportation of materials to the construction project site.","model naufal d. aditia, dendi p. ishak industrial engineering department universitas indonesia jakarta, indonesia naufal.diaz@ui.ac.id dendi@ui.ac.id",
126,Lean Construction Analysis Of The Interior Project,"the implementation of the interior project development delays so that the total duration of the development a setback, the occurrence of the delay was due to waste in project activities. based on this, this study aims to analyze the types of waste and their causes and make an improvement that can result in timely scheduling for the next soho (small office home office) project. the approach used is the project management and lean construction. project management approach by monitoring the s curve and identify the critical path using the critical path method (cpm), this approach is used to see differences in weekly progress and the critical path in interior work. the lean construction approach uses value stream mapping to identify waste in current state mapping, fishbone diagrams to describe the causes of waste, and future state mapping to describe improvements that will be made in order to produce timely project scheduling. the result of this research, there is waste in the critical work of this project, it is a waste of defects, inventory, and waiting. the cause of waste that occurs in the implementation of interior projects is waste waiting because the material is stored in a warehouse located far from the workshop, so it takes a long time. waste defects by checking material samples and waste inventory by submission of materials with the same specifications. so from the proposed improvement, the duration of the interior project is 15 days faster from 85 days to 70 days.","project management, lean construction, waste","From the results of the study, it can be concluded that: 1. Waste that occurs in interior projects is waste waiting, defects, and inventory. The cause of waste that occurs in the implementation of interior projects is waste waiting because the material is stored in a warehouse located far from the workshop, so it takes a long time, so operators have to wait to carry out the production process. The cause of the waste defect is due to measurement and cutting errors by unskilled operators, materials that do not meet specifications. The cause of inventory waste is because the material stock from the supplier is empty, material planning errors, and the absence of alternative suppliers. 2. The proposed activity improvement in order to reduce the waste is waste waiting by delivery of materials from suppliers directly to the workshop, merging processes. Waste defects by checking material samples and waste inventory by submission of materials with the same specifications. So from the proposed improvement, the duration of the interior project is 15 days faster from 85 days to 70 days.","dinda ayu nawangsasi, master degree student, departement of industrial engineering universitas mercu buana dki jakarta, indonesia dindaanaw@gmail.com zulfa fitri ikatrinasari senior lecturer, departement of industrial engineering universitas mercu buana dki jakarta, indonesia zulfa.fitri@mercubuana.ac.id",
127,Disruptive Strategies In The Use Of Digital Tools In Public  Universities Of The Amazon In The Time Of Covid 19,"the educational scenario of current university higher education is challenging. it is in this context that public universities have been experiencing changes of great importance in the educational system, moving from attendance to the new form of virtuality. this reality shows that universities are adopting the intensive use of digital tools in teachers and students, in the case of teachers, this process goes from planning to the evaluation of student learning achievements, allowing active participation. in this whole process. in this context, the research problem arises: how are disruptive strategies related to the use of digital tools in public universities in the amazon in times of covid - 19?, and as a general objective: determine how relates the disruptive strategies in the use of digital tools in public universities in the amazon in the time of covid - 19. in this sense, the disruptive strategy based on the use of digital tools is of great relevance to develop learning. the implementation of disruptive strategies in university education as a paradigm from the teacher's actions is conceived with a critical view of innovative practices in the new context of virtuality, making use of digital tools and seeking new solutions to the pedagogical problems reflected. in teaching practices. the use of digital tools in the university educational field allows the development of the virtual meeting between teachers and students; likewise, it facilitates a series of daily tasks because they can be simultaneously connected to various technological devices and access virtual platforms to present the sessions or topics to be discussed in a selected manner, schedule videoconferences, forums, tasks, surveys, digital whiteboards, assistance, online evaluations. line, share screen, schedule videos and other activities in the virtual environment interweaving synchronous and asynchronous communication. the results show that there is a significant relationship between the study variables; that is, that the disruptive strategies (x) correspond in proportion in each of the five categories with the use of digital tools (y) in the public universities of the amazon in times of covid-19; which indicates that there is a frequency association between the two variables.","virtual education, digital tools, asynchronous","The results have made it possible to determine the relationship between disruptive strategies and the use of digital tools in public universities of the Amazon in the time of COVID - 19, taking as a sample the teachers of the National University of San Martín, given that the value of p = Sig.

Establishing a connected infrastructure of this kind is complex but by defining the intended role and technical limitations of individual component such as the gateway or the controllers helped with the implementation of the functionalities at their respective layer. The ability to accurately assess these hardware and software limitations is the key factor to have a highly detailed view of the complex ecosystem. Visualizing each layer where value is added to the raw data and becoming a meaningful data packet greatly helps estimating the final informative potential of the data packet. Furthermore, the communication links used to support the data flows and the cloud connectivity is what defines the collaborative capacities of the entire platform. We can therefore demonstrate that the implementation of a connected environment combining several IoT technologies is a contextual task that needs a serious in-depth pre-implementation analysis of the needs. With rapidly evolving connected technologies, an IoT platform shouldn’t simply be deployed and forget without searching at new technologies which could influence today’s processes and connectivity in the near future. Once collected data reach the cloud, it must transform its informative potential into contextual actions within or outside the connected ecosystem.","francis rousseau iot & industry 4.0 department uzinakod montréal, canada francis.rousseau.1@ens.etsmtl.ca tony wong systems engineering department école de technologie supérieure montréal, canada tony.wong@etsmtl.ca",

131,Case Study Of Business Continuity Plan And Disaster  Recovery Plan For Banking Industry In Indonesia,"in every type of industry, the company has its own risk that threatens its business continuity and activities. the banking industry, which even plays a vital role in the country's economy, is not an exception to that risk. in general, businesses have two types of threats: natural (e.g., volcanic eruption, flood, tsunami, etc.) and human threats (e.g., sabotage, fire, terrorism, cybercrime, power outage, etc.). therefore, the banking industry needs to develop a good bcp (business continuity plan) and drp (disaster recovery plan) to support its continuity and mitigate the risk that may threaten the business. in indonesia, risk management for banks is regulated by the financial services authority (ojk) and the indonesian central bank (bi). this study will include applicable law by the mentioned authority, best practices for risk management, business continuity management standards, practiced risk policies from banks, research reports, and secondary sources. by analyzing the resources and data, this study will include risk scenarios, business impact analysis, and business continuity strategy for the banking industry. the result of this study could be used as a basis for developing a business continuity plan and disaster recovery plan to manage risks and recover optimally from any disaster or be a basis for further study on business continuity, disaster recovery, and risk management.","banking, earthquakes","The banking industry in Indonesia cannot be separated from natural and human threats because banks in Indonesia are in all cities in Indonesia. Due to these threats, the banking industry faces ten kinds of risks. Therefore, a good Business Continuity Plan and Disaster Recovery Plan are needed to maintain the business continuity of the banking industry in Indonesia in the event of an unexpected disaster. To develop a good Business Continuity Plan and Disaster Recovery Plan, it is necessary to identify good risks by compiling a Risk Scenario Table. After identifying the risks that could have an impact on the banking industry, a risk assessment needs to be carried out to find out how much impact these risks have on banking business processes so that the process of preparing the Business Continuity Plan and Disaster Recovery Plan can be carried out on target. Then after the Risk Assessment is carried out, a Business Impact Analysis also needs to be carried out to find out what impacts can be caused if the risk occurs and how big the effect is. After all the analysis is done, the preparation of a Business Continuity Plan and a Disaster Recovery Plan can be prepared. In conclusion, the Business Continuity Plan and Disaster Recovery Plan that we designed is if a disaster occurs, all employees will be transferred to a backup workplace that is not affected by the disaster. If the branch office is disturbed, the secondary workplace is the nearest previously determined branch office. If the head office is in a disaster, the employees will be transferred to the Secondary Operation Center in another bank building determined. And if the data center experiences a disaster, banks must prepare several backup data centers as a backup for use. In addition, this paper only provides a basic overview of the design of the banking Business Continuity Plan and Disaster Recovery Plan with the basic regulations applicable in Indonesia with observation and risk analysis. Each bank's Business Continuity Plan and Disaster Recovery Plan may vary according to their respective strategies and needs.

132,"Intrinsic, Extrinsic Rewards And Job Satisfaction:  Role Of  Job Performance And Creative Performance","despite the importance of motivation and job satisfaction, scholars have yet to identify how different types of motivation relate to job satisfaction. building on self-determination theory, this study explores the relationship between intrinsic and extrinsic rewards, job performance, creative performance, and job satisfaction. this study proposes job performance and creative performance as potential mediators through which intrinsic and extrinsic rewards relate to job satisfaction. data collected from 166 employees in india were used to test the hypothesis. to accomplish this objective, a questionnaire was distributed, and these relationships were tested through structured equation modeling using spss software. this study revealed that intrinsic and extrinsic rewards positively influence job performance. in contrast, only intrinsic rewards positively influence creative performance, and extrinsic rewards do not have a significant influence on creative performance. the relationship between job performance and job satisfaction is statistically significant, and the relationship between creative performance and job satisfaction is statistically significant. this paper expands the external validity of previous research results of western samples by finding the positive influence of intrinsic, extrinsic rewards indirect effects on job satisfaction.","intrinsic rewards, extrinsic rewards, job performance","Our results suggest that both intrinsic and extrinsic rewards increase job performance. This idea is supported by the results of various studies (Cerasoli et al. 2014; Eisenberger & Aselage 2009), which showed a positive relationship between intrinsic and extrinsic rewards and job performance. Most previous studies have examined the effect of intrinsic rewards (Manzoor et al. 2021) and extrinsic rewards (Bartol & Durham 2000) separately. This study examines the joint effect of intrinsic and extrinsic rewards on job satisfaction via job performance and creative performance. The findings of this study also show that intrinsic rewards positively influence creative performance whereas extrinsic rewards do not have any influence on creative performance. The reason extrinsic rewards do not affect creative performance may be that the effect of extrinsic rewards may be dependent on personal qualities such as learning orientation and perceived value of rewards, and organizational factors like innovative climate. When employees are offered extrinsic rewards for creative performance when the task itself is not intrinsically rewarding, it may not result in creative performance (Choi et al. 2015). Lastly, the results show that job performance and creative performance have a positive influence on job satisfaction. This paper contributes to the research on the effect of rewards on job satisfaction by examining the combined effect of intrinsic and extrinsic rewards on job satisfaction through the mediating effect of job performance and creative performance.","cynthia manimegalai research scholar business school vellore institute of technology chennai, india cynthia.mani.08@gmail.com dr. shwetha m krishna assistant professor business school vellore institute of technology chennai, india shwetham.krishnappa@vit.ac.in",

134,Coloring Intersection Points Of Line Segments,"we study the minimum number of colors with which the intersection points of a set of line segments can be colored so that no segment contains points with the same color. we investigate the computational complexity of this problem and give exact results and bounds for different families of segments, including those corresponding to complete bipartite graphs, cactus graphs, and triangle-free graphs. we also relate the problem to the famous erdős–faber– lovász conjecture, and discuss computational experiments for certain randomly generated sets of segments.","line segment, intersection, cactus graph",,"boris brimkov assistant professor, department of mathematics and statistics slippery rock university slippery rock, pennsylvania, usa boris.brimkov@sru.edu",
135,Optimization Of Last Mile Hub Location Determination For  Package Delivery Using Facility Location Problem,"technological developments in the world today greatly affect the development of technology-based business models, one of them is e-commerce or electronic commerce. the digital-based trading business is projected to increase by 51.6 percent from 2020. the development of transactions on this online trading platform also affects businesses in the fulfillment or service sector, which includes a series of processes for fulfilling product orders from customers. this process is closely related to the parcel/expedition shipping industry. in an expedition, the process of sending goods from the starting point to the end point is divided into three parts, namely first mile, middle mile, and last mile. last mile delivery is a process carried out by logistics parties to send and deliver packages to recipients. optimal hub locations can lead to reduced transportation costs as they directly affect the flow of goods. the purpose of determining a suitable location for the hub is to establish an efficient flow of goods delivery connections so that goods can be distributed as quickly as possible to the final recipient of the goods. therefore, the determination of the last mile hub becomes very important because it deals directly with the recipient of the goods so that it affects satisfaction with the services of a freight forwarder. in this study, the author uses a case study in an expedition company in indonesia for the depok area coverage and uses the facility location problem method to find out the most appropriate location and number of hubs to cover the entire area by considering the coverage area and cost of the selected hub building. the optimization results are able to provide a warehouse choice solution with cheaper warehouse rental costs and cheaper transportation costs in specifications for a larger number of warehouses. as an example of a 10 km coverage scenario, providing 4 warehouses with the furthest delivery point of 9.3 km has a total cost of idr 6,500,363,150 or 12% lower cost than the existing condition. with a lower furthest point, the distance and time required for parcel delivery is also faster and has the potential to increase customer satisfaction.","last mile hub, logistic, operation research","and Future Research Optimal hub location can lead to reduced transportation costs because it directly affects the flow of goods. The purpose of determining a suitable location for the hub is to establish an efficient flow of goods delivery connections so that goods can be distributed as quickly as possible to the final recipient of the goods. Literature studies were also conducted to examine the Last Mile Hub, Optimization Model, Facility Location Problem, and how to verify and validate the optimization model. From the results of this study, it can be concluded that the optimization model is able to determine the location of the Last Mile Hub with the lowest warehouse and transportation rental costs compared to existing conditions. Compared to other studies, this study uses transportation costs as one of the variables to determine and consider the location of the selected hub. Based on the results of the study, the following are some suggestions that can be made in further research, including further research to provide a function to limit warehouse capacity, take into account and optimize the number of couriers, consider couriers to have their own routes and not assume one-way for optimizing advanced transportation costs and adding recommended courier routes for further optimization of transportation costs","muhammad i. hazami industrial engineering department universitas indonesia jakarta, indonesia muhammad.indra01@ui.ac.id zulkarnain industrial engineering department universitas indonesia jakarta, indonesia zulkarnain@ie.ui.ac.id",

Provide a systematic procedure to follow in conducting the job that is more efficient yet considers the safety for the delivery riders so that the rider will be able to manage his/her time without wasting others. a. The company should set a quota of delivery per day for each delivery rider employees depending on the average time capacity that is suit to the delivery time of the restaurant or fast food that will still create a balance work time for every rider regardless the distance. b. They should properly designate the required number of delivery riders depending on the demand of the specific place to avoid lack and overemployed workers. c. As the riders preferred 5-8 hours of work followed by 9-12 hours, the company should openly create a concrete scheduling with the given 8 hours of work and a quota of 15 orders, since the open-ended questions resulted 15 as a satisfying accepted orders by the rider that will suit with the time and distance with 30-40 minutes per order. Hence, the company can make it 10 hours per day for the adjusted time by late service of restaurant and other concerns by the customer. d. The Food Panda company can also make a specific time frame for the riders own preferred time that could be for morning, afternoon, and evening to midnight shift with the 10 hours requirement and 15 to 20 accepted orders so that the rider can choose their preferred schedule along with the company’s requirement of orders per day and these are the time frame per day: Morning: 7:00 am – 5:00 pm; Afternoon: 1:00 pm – 11:00 pm; Evening: 7:00 pm – 5:00 pm; Midnight: 12:00 am – 10:00 am e. Additionally, as the researchers found 5-8 hours as more preferred by the riders, the company can also make schedule with this time table for those who treat food delivery service as their part time job with the quota of 10 accepted orders.

141,Understanding The Linkage And Driving Factors To  Premature Closure Of Microbusinesses: A Case Study In,"the critical failure factors (cffs) affecting the premature closure of microbusinesses (mbs) remain an understudied field in the scientific community. this led to the prevalent issue of rapid and continuous failure rate among mbs which necessitates the need to produce more studies to aid this sector considering its implications for employment generation, idea innovation, and an overall increase in the gross domestic product (gdp) in a country. this paper focuses on the investigation of the importance ratings of the linkage and driving cffs across the food and clothing industry in cebu city, philippines. using a mann-whitney u-test, the key results showed there no exist a significant difference in the importance rating of the cffs between the two mb types. in addition, the statistical analysis showed a higher mean- rank of importance rating in the food industry compared to the clothing industry. this concludes that policymakers need not to further introduce a specific government program depending on the mb type. furthermore, more emphasis should be geared towards the food mbs considering that it establishes a higher mean-rank rating in the cffs and are therefore more prone to premature closures.","microbusiness, premature closure","This paper takes into account the premature closure of MBs given the vital role of this business entity in increasing a country’s GDP. The focus of this paper reels into the CFFs affecting the premature closure of MBs due to how this area remains understudied in the scientific community. To advance this significant research gap in the literature, a statistical analysis is performed among the importance ratings of the linkage and driving factors affecting the premature closures of MBs. The statistical analysis tool utilized is a Mann-Whitney U-Test in comparing the mean rank of the CFFs across various types of MBs. Moreover, the paper investigates the relevance of policymakers’ having a general, non-specific government program in aiding the operations of MB owners. The key results of this paper concluded there is no significant difference in the importance ratings of the CFFs affecting the premature closure of MBs regardless of the business type. This finding implies that owners’ perceptions of the CFFs across various types of MBs are of the same impact in terms of their success or failure. In the Philippines’ setting, the government’s current practices of implementing general programs to aid all MB types is a favorable response to combat the problem of premature closure. To further expound, the mean-ranking of the importance ratings showed key results wherein MB owners of food businesses rank significantly higher in importance ratings to factor- to-factor comparison against MB owners of clothing businesses. The higher mean-rank rating in the food industry implies that this sector is more prone to the effects of the CFFs and should be allotted more aid and resources by the government to reach success and avoid premature closures. This is attributed to the food industry being the most competitive type of MB due to their products being considered a basic commodity and are fast-moving in nature. This paper exhibits the following limitations and probable research expansions for future studies. For one, the types of MBs can consider more than two types aside from the food and clothing industries (e.g., technology, service, agri- business, among others). Having more than two types of MBs considered can be investigated by means of a k-factor statistical analysis. This investigation would provide insights into whether similar key results can be derived in retaining the null hypothesis that there exists no statistical difference in the importance ratings across multiple types of MBs. For another, the core of this paper may also be reproduced in a case study involving another environment, given that the definition of MBs differs from its state or country of origin, declared gross annual income, and total assets. This could potentially generate a significantly different result and would introduce more avenues for further research.","cebu, philippines eunice cristyl d. del pilar industrial and systems engineering department de la salle university 2401 taft ave. malate, manila, philippines eunice_delpilar@dlsu.edu.ph",
142,The Assessment Of Food Allergens In Food Management  Systems,"food allergens are proteins that are present in the food in significant amounts, they survive food processing environments. the risk caused by food allergens has increased in the last 20 years and it continues to expand. food intolerances and food allergies are now well-known as a food safety concern, which must be succeeded. in the food industry, consideration of the risk caused by allergenic foods remains unpredictable. managing this allergic risk would benefit from a better consistency of allergen management, practices and methods. one of the basic human rights, is to have access to safe food and it is of paramount importance that food is accurately labeled in appropriately. food allergy have recently become a worldwide health concern. food allergy is a result of an abnormal immune response to certain types of food proteins that may lead to an adverse health reaction and can cause death. in the study, allergen bradford test was conducted on rinsed water of diosna mixers after production. the goal was to determine the organization effectiveness and efficiency of their allergen food management system. the results for products that entailed whew powder and soya as one of the ingredients list, showed traces of protein concentrations. the concentrations were compared with acceptable allergen limits listed on regulations r. 146 and r. 293. it is important that manufacturing industries not only comply with food management regulations but to ensure a robust allergen management plan.","food allergens, food safety, bradford test, vomiting","Allergens are naturally present from food that we eat, in the past years allergens were not known and their health hazards remained unnoticed until consumer eating patterns were traced back. Most children deaths were due to allergic reactions and no one knew how to prevent such a horrific cause. It was later discovered that consumers need to be informed with what they are eating from restaurants to retail stores. Food labelling was the main cause of allergic reactions and food manufactures need to be informed on such cases. The research was conducted in a flavor industry that supplies raw materials to final manufacturers in the food chain. Allergen samples were taken within the facilities production area after eight successful production and cleaning procedures were complete. The allergen concentrations were measured using the verification and validation methods. Both methods depicted that the third and eighth products had significant presence of allergen proteins. This was due to the high quantities of whey and soya powder used in the ingredients and how the cleaning methods were not effective. This research also found that the mechanical energy of cleaning workforce significantly decreases near closing business hours. The cleaning protocols must be visited, and sampling time must also be changed. The statistical results show that the last production significantly differed from other products. This was the due to the ingredient whey and soya used in the manufacturing of this product.","sandy mosia, nita sukdeo and anup pradhan department of quality and operations management school of mechanical and industrial engineering university of johannesburg, gauteng, south africa 201248722@student.uj.ac.za; nsukdeo@uj.ac.za; anupp@uj.ac.za kemlall ramsaroop ramdass department of mechanical and industrial engineering faculty of engineering university of south africa, gauteng ramdakr@unisa.ac.za",
143,Integration Of Conjoint Analysis And Environmentally  Conscious Quality Function Deployment For Design,"the increase in carbon emissions by the transportation sector is correlated with the rise in the number of vehicles in indonesia, especially vehicles with internal combustion engines which reaches at least 30% of the total national carbon emissions. carbon emissions cause environmental damage, prompting the indonesian government to implement a carbon emission policy on ice vehicles, and the adoption of electric-based vehicle. however, the customers' adoption rate is still limited, partly due to the limited choice of electric vehicles products in indonesia and unit prices, which are still relatively expensive. this paper intends to explore the design of electric vehicles by paying attention to customer needs to obtain product designs that are most in-demand and most likely to be realized by the related industry. for this purpose, the integration of conjoint analysis (based on full combination model) and environmentally conscious quality function deployment (qfd) methods is carried out, helpful in connecting customer aspects with technical aspects in the automotive industry. the research was conducted by exploring nine attributes and 30 levels of product design variations covering performance, technology, and service aspects of electric vehicle such as maximum power and torque; maximum range; vehicle model; battery capacity; battery charging speed; expected battery life; technology features and vehicle price. 32 design variation obtained which combining nine attributes and 30 product design level. through environmentally conscious quality function deployment (ecqfd) method, the product design obtained is realized as a production strategy to obtain an electric vehicle design that best suits customers' preferences.","emission, electric vehicle, conjoint analysis, ecqfd","Based on the research conducted, several conclusions were obtained, namely: 1. Application of conjoint analysis can be used as input in the voice of consumer section in the ECQFD, and the relative importance of the results of the conjoint analysis can be used as input for the planning matrix stage; 2. Conjoint analysis can be an instrument that bridges the interests of consumers and industry, especially in the design of electric vehicles; 3.

144,The Application Of Lean Management To Improve  Productivity – A Case Study Of Kinik Company,"this study applies lean management approaches in grinding wheel production, such as value-stream mapping, quick changeover, and line balancing to decrease lead time, work-in-process, changeover time, and increase quality and productivity. customer orders of grinding wheel products have the characteristics of low volume and wide variety while the production process is labor-intensive as well. among all processes of grinding wheel production, the mixed process and burned process are the most time-consuming steps, any unexpected breakdown will significantly decrease available capacity and lead to bottleneck in production, which causes additional cost. by illustrating the as-is model of value-stream mapping after collecting production system information and analyzing the current state of manufacturing production, we set the goal for improvement. after implementing capacity balance improvements and importing the quick changeover method, the to-be model was developed to evaluate the improvement by reducing non-value-adding waste, including waiting, transportation and inventory. this research combines theory and practical applications, hoping to effectively improve grinding wheel production to increase production effectiveness and efficiency, therefore enhancing the competitiveness of the traditional manufacturing industry.","grinding wheel, lean management, quick changeover",,"james c. chen department of industrial engineering and engineering management national tsing hua university hsinchu, taiwan, r.o.c james@ie.nthu.edu.tw thomas hsieh and tony pai kinik company new taipei city, taiwan, r.o.c thomas@kinik.com.tw, tonypai@kinik.com.tw mu-hsuan lee, chia-ruei lee, yung-hsin su and kung-chin koo department of industrial engineering and engineering management national tsing hua university hsinchu, taiwan, r.o.c sandylee3453@gmail.com, gary271828@gmail.com, fr3181827@gmail.com, tpekingkoo@gmail.com",
145,Patient-Specific Three-Dimensional Bone Printing To  Facilitate Educational Purpose & Practice Surgery:,"currently, bangladeshi surgeons approach surgeries by observing 2d reports or very often 3d photographic views of the affected body parts to assume a 3d construction of that body part, which is surely a difficult process and also may lack in assumption sometimes. most often, students in operation theatre (ot) being large in number fails to understand the surgical procedures due to the lack of proper visualization. even due to not having a sufficient level of experience, they don’t get the chance to perform any practice surgery, so they have to learn only by visualization, which is definitely a long-time process. moreover, medical students sometimes face financial problems in buying costly human bones. to get rid of these shortcomings, this study aims to introduce the manufacturing of patient-specific 3d printed models. proper application of this technology will work as an aid to be able to provide low budget 3d printed human bones required for educational purposes, increase the learning proficiency of medical students by giving them chances to perform practice surgeries and also lessen patient’s intraoperative bleeding time, anaesthetic exposure and heat loss through proper pre-surgical planning by surgeons as the outcome of practice surgery, which will lead to achieving a higher satisfaction level of the patients that promises to change the current medical scenario of bangladesh tremendously.","3d modeling, patient-specific, human skeleton","To provide a solution to the current problems, this paper presents calculations of cost and time regarding 3D printed bones. Also, the manufacturing and non-manufacturing costs were incorporated to get the final cost tables from the perspective of Bangladesh. This proposes to integrate 3D printing of different bones and a dummy web page to provide the facility among doctors and medical students in practical. This system is evaluated using a simulation model created in ARENA simulation software to get the capacity result. Again, the business side of this 3D printing systems compared by calculating unit product cost incurred in production. Finally, after evaluation of the implementation of this technology, the results indicate that incorporating this system in the real-life scenario may bring a huge development to the medical sector as well as to the country. The proposed web page model not just presents another plan of action to provide 3D printed bones, but additionally gives a promising approach to deal with the existing problems in Bangladesh and opening a new source to the manufacturing society in the near future.","creating a blueprint in perspective of future bangladesh wardatul akmam department of industrial and production engineering rajshahi university of engineering & technology rajshahi, bangladesh akmam.ipe15@gmail.com abdullah al mahmud department of industrial and production engineering rajshahi university of engineering & technology rajshahi, bangladesh george.ipe15@gmail.com",

154,Towards The Development Of A Usability Evaluation Of  A Pregnancy Health Monitoring System Using Iot,"pregnancy health monitoring systems enable women to have access to remote quality care during pregnancy. the integration of wearable devices has had a positive impact on maternal health care monitoring technologies. maternal health requires a comprehensive structure that permits pregnant women to be closely monitored in a continuous manner. as a result, the necessity to assess its usability grows. in order to identify what features and processes implemented in existing applications aid in overcoming the usability challenges of pregnancy-related apps, related studies involving pregnant health care monitoring systems, pregnancy-related apps, and their usability evaluation were found and examined in this literature review. from the literature reviewed, there are several usability issues that are frequently found in pregnancy health monitoring systems such as the lack of ability to provide better health outcomes and lack of improvement in health monitoring. the analysis showed that these issues stem from the lack of effectiveness and ultimately result in negative impacts on user experience. this was likewise the most prominent usability challenge found in the literature reviewed. other usability challenges found include the lack of interest in the applications, having too much incomprehensible information, and apps being non-user-friendly. in addition, the study identified that iot-based process flows are helpful in recording data and maintaining user engagement. with this, the study proposed the development of a pregnant health monitoring system based on iot-based processes. a usability evaluation was planned for the proposed system to test and assess its usability.",iot wearables,"Upon further analysis, there were several usability challenges found in the gathered pregnancy-related applications that required further improvement and testing, and most of them expressed the system's lack of effectiveness. Features and processes of existing pregnancy health monitoring systems were also identified which served as bases for the proposed system of the study, utilizing Nielsen's usability principles to evaluate the system usability to address previous challenges encountered by past studies.","mary jane c. samonte school of information technology, mapúa university, manila, philippines, mjcsamonte@yahoo.com bea shaneal francesca f. franco, helisha a. ocampo, and mauryn angela f. rodriguez school of information technology mapúa university, makati city, philippines bsfffranco@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, haocampo@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, mafrodriguez@mymail.mapua.edu.ph",

158,The Value-Focused Management Applied To Healthcare  Organizations,"this article will describe how the value-focused management model (vfm) is perceived in different literature references, evaluate what was the implementation status of the technique in healthcare organizations before the covid-19 pandemic, and understand the impact it had on the road map of the healthcare transformation. moreover, to better understand the perceived importance of the model by different entities, multiple real-case scenarios and surveys will be reviewed. the main theoretical foundation for the article will be the book “focused operations management for healthcare organizations” by boaz ronen, joseph s. pliskin, and shimeon pass.","healthcare, value creation, patient outcomes","After reviewing the current models of healthcare, the trends, and some of the thoughts shared by industry leaders, is fair to say that there is still a long way to go to collect all the benefits that come from a value-based care system. Although this path was designed and started to be pursued a long time ago, different circumstances, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, had impacted this transformation and delayed its implementation. Now, in the recovery from the pandemic, the U.S. health system has a great opportunity to actively change its approach. The industry CEOs have shown concerns about different issues and admitted that personnel shortages and financial challenges are on top of the list of issues to be addressed. Luckily, both these issues can be, at least partially, solved by reorganizing the organizational structure and adopting cross-functional teams, and by implementing an outcome-based costing model. The research presented showed successful cases for both of these suggestions and strengthened the hypothesis that this is the way to go. However, the most critical point is that the pressure toward such an industry transformation must be applied by governmental and regulatory agencies, as the old models still in place don’t leave much space for providers and payers to change and still comply with their legal obligations.

160,Core Retrieval Decisions Under Quality Uncertainty In  Remanufacturing System,"to ensure the flow of products with different classes in supply chains such as closed-loop supply chains, etc., managing quality uncertainty estimation is a cost-effective, profitable, and environment-friendly contribution by establishing standard recovery treatments of cores. the paper compares the quality values obtained from bayesian analysis with deterministic levels to analyze the core retrieval strategies. the uncertainty effects due to several quality factors are demonstrated in both the inspection and disassembly stages. such as misclassification that occurred because of overlapping of quality ranges in consideration with fuzzy evaluation during value and material recovery. moreover, the adopted dual methodology invalidates the legitimacy of providing probability distribution to unknown variables in previously developed models. both probabilistic and prescriptive models are moderated by the qualitative assessment of cores facilitated by realistic scenarios. with the help of the proposed mixed approaches, the current research contributes to the knowledge of core retrieval management by incorporating the quality variability in the model at the product level. the result demonstrates that quality estimates ensure precise eligibility and misclassification detection of returns of cores at the initial stages well- before exhaustive remanufacturing operations.","core quality, core recovery, bayesian modeling, prescriptive model","and Managerial Implications The study fills the gaps in establishing quality levels of returns by investigating two approaches, viz. probabilistic and prescriptive. The proposed grading and sorting tool provides the determination of quality range at the product level rather than assuming any popular distribution scheme. Some managerial implications are as follows: Firstly, the quality levels are better in the disassembly stage due to the attainment of filtered cores after inspection. The unfeasible scenarios should be identified and rectified by the managers in the decision making (1) When the core is fully functional and possess recoverable after severe disassembly in no time. (2) When the core is fully functional with no parts recovery when given maximum time for disassembly without any severe destruction.

161,Intelligent Mobility Management System (Imms): Scoping  Review,"smart mobility is one of the essential aspects of smart cities, and the proper management of intelligent mobility can create an optimized and sustainable smart city. for these reasons, the field of intelligent transport remains a sector that attracts research attention, and hence there is a need for a scoping review on this topic. this paper presents a scoping review of intelligent mobility management systems (immss) with the aim of clarifying and summarizing the status of relevant articles dealing with this topic. in this paper, we describe and apply the process of a scoping review as proposed by peterson to the topic of immss, based on a research method previously applied in the field of medicine. a total of 266 relevant articles were selected, and a classification framework was applied to extract the information needed to carry out an in-depth analysis of immss. this analysis gave us a clear vision of the subject and produced a new state of the art. the novel contributions of our work are as follows: 1. we introduce a general framework for classifying information from studies in this area; 2. we present a summary of current research on the subject; 3. we discuss our results and their implications for future research. this scoping review provided us with a general overview of the topic of immss and helped us identify gaps and trends in this field. one of the conclusions that can be drawn from this scoping review is that this is an active research area that is attracting attention from researchers, with many open issues still to be addressed. proceedings of the 7th north american international conference on industrial engineering and operations management, orlando, florida, usa, june 12-14, 2022 © ieom society international 1386",,"This paper has presented a scoping review of IMMSs, and has provided a general overview of the topic with its trends and gaps. The number of evaluated papers was 266, all of which were published between 2017 and 2021 in recognized databases (IEEE Xplore and Scopus). We obtained the following results, which may clarify the outlook of researchers wanting to work on IMMSs. The methods most commonly applied to this topic were AI, IoT, and GPS. The use of these techniques may be explained by the very high numbers of connected devices and the aim of creating an intelligent world. The year 2020 saw a large number of scientific contributions to the subject of IMMSs. In the period between 2017 and 2021, China and USA were the countries with the highest interest in this topic. This result is likely to be due to the R&D investment rates of these countries. Although there are several application areas associated with IMMSs, road transportation was predominant during the period studied, and the main contribution was mobility management.

162,Is An Academic Degree Required For A Successful Product  Manager?,"recent years have shown some pioneering and advanced academic study areas required for the diversified business environment. these modern academic programs are prepared and offered to meet the market demands and needs. product management is one of the innovative fields which is getting importance and growing rapidly in the recent years. the study focused that which academic program will help and guide the smes and business enterprises for the better prospect for their business? unfortunately, a lack of qualified and certified product managers or product developers has also been observed in the recent past. nevertheless, product managers have become vital to business success because of their choices, decisions, and actions inherent to the attainment or failure of business growth. however, undergraduate programs are not equipped with proper certificate courses for product management, product design, or product development. this complicates the students in opting and joining any academic major to become a professional product manager. thus, the basic issue is about which academic discipline is better suited for the development of successful product managers. hence, the basic purpose of the study is to investigate the academic study disciplines that best serve the product manager career. in addition, the study explores whether an academic program such as bachelor's, master or ph.d. degree is essential and helpful for product managers. a thorough literature review, analysis of workforce databases, and questions asked by key product executives are used for the current study. the study's approach is descriptive and exploratory to assess and evaluate the collected data. it uses a cross-sectional survey method for data analysis purposes. the findings indicate that a bachelor’s degree in business, marketing, computer science or engineering, and information technology are the most popular specializations for product managers. the study also discussed the market needs and demands to distinguish between different job professions to better understand the academic requirements for product managers. additionally, it was found that competent product managers after gaining substantial expertise in their field quite often pursue a master's in business management, business administration (mba), or leadership.","product manager, product management, smes","Over the years the area of a product manager has developed the need for highly structured, technically skilled employees who also possess critical-thinking skills and can use creative strategies to solve business problems. This study shows that what education a product manager should have and what avenues of academic studies are best suited for product managers. The study also provides answers to common questions regarding job opportunities and relevant professions. The study focuses on the education needs and experience required by Saudi business advertisers and employers. In the recruitment of product managers, the concept of envisioning business, strategic, and entrepreneurial mindsets have played an integral role. According to the survey, strategic thinking is the most important notion for the product management profession. The majority of firms are looking for technical product management expertise when hiring a product manager. Data analysis tools, Microsoft Excel ability, and product strategy formulation are among these highly preferred skills. Information technology, which is highlighted in the advertisements, is another important factor for the product manager. Well-trained, educated, experienced product managers are vital in the innovative product development process, productivity, profitability, and competitiveness of a business organization. A product manager must have advanced product development capabilities for a company to remain relevant in its marketplace and grow rapidly while improving over a certain period of time. Market need is also observed by addressing some of the common job roles in the business organizations as it was compared with two other job portfolios. It showed from good to a high number of involvement of product managers in the business organizations concerning different job requirements. According to the study results, product managers are often expected to have a bachelor's degree. That degree may be in Business Administration, Accounting, Computer Science, Management Sciences, Information Technology, or any other related field. The study showed that a product manager must have at least one professional certification in product management and a Bachelor's degree. No specific degree program is required to rise to the position of product manager.

168,Predicting Bank Loan Eligibility Using Machine Learning  Models And Comparison Analysis,"as people's demands grow, so does the need for bank loans. every day, banks get many loan applications from customers and other individuals but not every applicant is accepted. typically, banks execute a loan application after verifying and evaluating the applicant's eligibility, which is a time-consuming and challenging process. when examining loan applications and making credit approval decisions, most banks use their credit score and risk assessment systems. despite this, some applicants fail to pay their bills each year, causing financial institutions to lose a substantial amount of money. in this study, machine learning (ml) algorithms are employed to extract patterns from a common loan-approved dataset and predict deserving loan applicants. customers' previous data will be used to undertake the study, including their age, income type, loan annuity, last credit bureau report, type of organization they work for, and length of employment. ml methods such as random forest, xgboost, adaboost, lightgbm, decision tree, and k-nearest neighbor were used to discover the maximum relevant features, i.e., the elements that have the most impact on the prediction output. these mentioned algorithms are compared and assessed against one another using standard metrics. among these, logistic regression achieved the highest accuracy of 92%. it was also determined as the best model and performed significantly well better than other machine learning methods in terms of f1-score, which is 96%.","loan sanction, machine learning, xgboost, adaboost","and Future Scope Today's fast-growing IT sector requires the development of new technology and the updating of existing technology that allows us to eliminate human interference and boost job productivity. This model is used for the banking system or anyone who wants to apply for a loan. Based on the examination of the data, it is apparent that it reduces all frauds committed during the loan approval process. Time is valuable to everyone, and by doing so, not only the bank, but also the applicant's waiting time will be reduced. Cleaning and processing of data, imputation of missing values, experimental analysis of data set, model construction, and testing on test data are all steps in the prediction process. The best-case accuracy attained on the original data set is 0.9189 on Data set. After analyzing the data, the following conclusions were drawn: those applicants with the lowest credit scores will be denied a loan since they have a higher risk of defaulting on the loan. Most of the time, applicants with a high income and requests for a smaller loan are more likely to be approved, which makes sense because they are more likely to repay their debts. Other factors, such as gender and marital status, do not appear to be considered by the corporation. This prediction module can be enhanced and integrated in the future. The system is prepared on the previous training data but in the future, it is possible to make changes to software, which can accept new testing data and should also take part in training data and predict accordingly. 7.","miraz al mamun department of economics & decision sciences the university of south dakota vermillion, south dakota, usa miraz.almamun@coyotes.usd.edu afia farjana and muntasir mamun department of computer science the university of south dakota vermillion, south dakota, usa afia.farjana@coyotes.usd.edu, muntasir.mamun@coyotes.usd.edu",
169,Learning Models For Delivery Location Clustering And  Drone-Based Routing Decisions In Last-Mile Distribution,"with the rise in e-commerce and growing consumer demand, supply chains are striving to achieve cost-efficient delivery operations. one of the most challenging distribution problems is the last-mile delivery which generally refers to the very last leg of the delivery operation when a parcel is moved from a depot to the end customer. despite the significant increase in the number of products ordered online and delivered directly to customers, the reliance on truck- based delivery has remained unchanged for decades. the integration of drones in the last-mile delivery can overcome many operational challenges and provide competitive advantages. traditional optimization algorithms for truck-drone suffer from high computational time and can solve only small-sized problems. this study focuses on finding an effective approach for solving the last-mile delivery problem. we propose a hybrid machine learning model to tackle the problem of delivering products to a set of delivery locations using a modern truck equipped with multiple drones. a constrained clustering algorithm is proposed to cluster delivery locations based on user-specified constraints in the first stage. the center of each constrained cluster serves as a launching site where the truck can park, and drones can be dispatched to make all final deliveries. a deep reinforcement learning model is proposed in the second stage to find an optimal route among all clusters. extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the proposed approach. solutions obtained are compared with other traditional algorithms. results show that our approach can produce quality solutions in real-time.","last-mile delivery, machine learning, clustering, routing planning",,"ali arishi ph.d. candidate, department of industrial, systems, & manufacturing engineering wichita state university wichita, usa aaarishi@shockers.wichita.edu krishna krishnan professor, department of industrial, systems, & manufacturing engineering wichita state university wichita, usa krishna.krishnan@wichita.edu",

171,Effect Of Personality On Newsvendor Decisions,"we present the results of a newsvendor experiment and out-of-experiment personality trait surveys. our study is based on a simple scenario where the decision maker determines the stock quantity for a perishable product with stochastic consumer demand. we explore the predictive power of self-esteem and regret tendency on ordering behavior in newsvendor setting. we find that subjects with higher self-esteem scores place larger orders and earn more profit under low purchasing cost setting, whereas the difference is not salient under high purchasing cost setting. moreover, decision-makers with higher regret tendency place orders with smaller variability and closer to the demand mean under high purchasing cost setting.",newsvendor,"Recent studies in behavioral operations and various case studies have revealed that despite formal training human subjects do not make the optimal order decision in practical newsvendor scenarios. This deviation results in significant suboptimality and profit loss for the companies. Hence, it is of crucial importance to identify the factors affecting ordering decisions and, if possible, to predict their effect and correct it. In this paper we explore the correlation between certain personality traits and newsvendor ordering decisions. We show that both self-esteem and regret tendency affect subject decisions significantly. The effect is asymmetrical with respect to the purchasing cost and hence our research hypotheses are partially supported by the data. However, it is worth noting that in our analysis 40 ordering decisions of each subject are averaged to obtain a single data point, which truncates the effects of personal factors. Additionally, subjects’ decisions are affected by the random consumer demand that is revealed after every ordering decision. Moreover, there are other factors which are not yet identified but still affect the ordering behavior. Hence the R2 values of the regression analyses are very low. As these other factors are identified and included into the analyses, it may be easier to detect the effect of personality traits. All in all, we believe we filled an existing gap in the behavioral operations literature by investigating the effects of self-esteem and regret tendency using out-of-experiment surveys.","ümmühan akbay department of management, işık university, istanbul 34980, turkey ummuhan.akbay@isikun.edu.tr murat kaya department of industrial engineering, sabanci university, istanbul 34956, turkey mkaya@sabanciuniv.edu",

Many researchers considered this topic and tried to design or develop methodologies for hubs location allocation. However, only few practical cases were implemented and tested in realistic scenarios. Asian countries have the highest frequency of implemented cases which indicates the current logistics development among those countries. Most of the relevant practical cases consider one, two or all of the following solving models and those include spatial modeling, optimization modeling and decision-making methodologies. Spatial model might be really effective as first phase whenever the feasible space is widely spread, while optimization models can be used as a single method which might solve the whole problem and lead to optimum or near optimum solution. Lastly, decision making methodologies could be used in many scenarios and whenever there is a lack of data, set of alternatives need to be ranked or very complex problem which is hard to be mathematically formulated.","malk almalki master student, department industrial engineering king saud university riyadh, saudi arabia malk.a.almalki@gmail.com mohammed alkahtani associate professor in industrial engineering department, and vice-dean of advanced manufacturing institute king saud university riyadh, saudi arabia moalkahtani@ksu.edu.sa",

186,Conversion From Diesel To Dual Fuel Power Generation  And Implications On The Transition,"diesel is the main fuel for use in industrial, transport, and in diesel power plants; unfortunately, it is polluting and non-renewable. the overall objective of this study is to assess the sustainability of converting diesel power plants to dual fuel power plants which use both diesel or heavy fuel oil and gas. the study showed that the use of natural gas simultaneously reduces the cost of generation per kilowatt hour (kwh) and emissions, particularly sox. the conversion process involves modification of the fuel injection system to cope with new fuel injection and ignition requirements, new control for fuel injection and reduced air to fuel ratio and lowering of the engines’ compression ratios through increase of the engine cylinder clearance volume. these fuel savings will influence renegotiation of the power purchase agreement resulting into lower tariffs, higher load factor and power plant utilization which translates to more revenue and reduced unit cost of power with lower environmental impact as well as better return on investment from the largest grid connected diesel power plant in east and central africa. this study showed that dual fuel diesel power plants running on both natural gas and diesel exhibit better performance indicators in terms of engine specific fuel consumption, engine brake thermal efficiency, diesel engine indicated thermal efficiency, the power plant electricity generating unit cost of power, the total engine emissions and hence leading to less environmental impact. key words: diesel engines; diesel power plants; gas engines; gas power plants; power plant design. 1. introduction diesel engines operate at a relatively higher efficiency and with a higher power density than petrol making them the best choice as prime movers in transport especially heavy-duty vehicles and in diesel power generation. the engines are also increasingly finding application in light-duty cars are dominated by petrol or gasoline engines. the main challenge of using diesel engines in power generation is the emissions mainly in the form of carbon dioxide, nox due to oxidation of nitrogen in the air at high combustion temperatures., particulate matter (pm) and sulphur dioxide from oxidation of sulphur component of the fuel (iea, 2021; kabeyi & oludolapo, 2020a, 2020f).the changing climatic conditions, strict environmental regulations, high cost of diesel power generation and general sustainability concerns have created need for cleaner and cheaper fuels for diesel power plants (arefin et al., 2020). in diesel power generation stations, diesel engines are used as prime movers for generators (kabeyi & olanrewaju, 2020b). diesel engines remain competitive for power generation because of their high full load and partial load brake thermal efficiency compared to many other prime movers. they are also quick to start and stop and have got capacity to burn different types of fuels (niemi, 1997). the engine market is large with over 20 manufacturers of piston diesel engines for power generation generally between 10 hp to 140 hp (andriulli et al., 1999). for a long time, many developing countries like kenya rely on hydropower for its bulk electricity generation for its grid electricity (kabeyi, 2020b; kabeyi & oludolapo, 2021a). this comes with low reliability due to seasonal variability of rainfall hence power plant availability. the need to meet the deficit occasioned by low rains or drought conditions create demand for expensive and polluting thermal power plants (andae, 2017). it is because of this challenge that kenya decided to build the largest diesel engine power plant in east and central africa, named kipevu iii in mombasa, kenya. the main challenges of diesel power plants are high and fluctuating fuel cost and high cost of plant operation and maintenance per unit power output. therefore, as the global community looks for a cheaper, cleaner and sustainable energy production, natural gas has emerged as an alternative fuel in power production (munde & dalu, 2012). the use of natural gas as a fuel in power generation proceedings of the 7th north american international conference on industrial engineering and operations management, orlando, florida, usa, june 12-14, 2022 © ieom society international 1581",,,"moses jeremiah barasa kabeyia, , oludolapo akanni olanrewajub a,bdepartment of industrial engineering faculty of engineering and the built environment durban university of technology, durban, sa a 22064693@dut4life.ac.za, boludolapoo@dut.ac.za",

The total cost of Balado Seasoning raw material inventory for components G, H, and K is IDR 490,000 while for other components is IDR 500,000. Based on the calculation of the MRP method, techniques suitable for controlling raw materials G, H, and K are the Period Order Quantity (POQ) techniques. This technique is suitable because it has a smaller total inventory cost than Lot For Lot (LFL) and Economic Order Quantity (EOQ). Then, for controlling other raw materials, the Lot For Lot (LFL) technique can be used because it has a total inventory cost that is smaller than the Period Order Quantity (POQ) and Economic Order Quantity (EOQ).","shella purnamadewi, shelly purnamasari, teguh sriwidadi department of management, binus business school undergraduate program bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia teguhs2405@binus.ac.id",

192,Assessing The Stochastic Dependence Effect On The  Integrated Preventive Maintenance Scheduling And,"integrating production planning and preventive maintenance (pm) scheduling is one of the most studied problems related to operations management. in fact, both decisions are highly interrelated. an efficient integration leads to cost optimization and high delivery reliability. in this paper, we evaluate the impact of the stochastic dependence on the integrated preventive maintenance scheduling and production planning. for this purpose, cox proportional hazards model (cphm), based on the exponential survival distribution and an integer programming model are used. the results show that increasing the degree of dependence affects both production and maintenance costs and the system’s available production capacity.",production planning,"In this paper, we have evaluated the stochastic dependence effect on the integration of production planning and maintenance schedule for a parallel two-machine system. We proposed a new approach based on CPHM to incorporate the stochastic dependence on an integer linear program to determine the optimal production plan with preventive replacement. The results showed that the stochastic dependence effect significantly influences the production plans, maintenance policies, and costs. Hence, it is recommended to use such an approach as a starting point, to obtain a more realistic planning, because not considering the stochastic dependence effect during the planning of these two activities causes excepted consequences and additional costs.","production planning ziyad bahou moad6, mohammadia school of engineers, mohammed v university, rabat, morocco ziyad.bahou@hotmail.fr issam krimi lamih, bear lab international university of rabat, rabat business school rabat, morocco issam.krimi@uir.ac.ma nizar elhachemi moad6, abs, mohammadia school of engineers, mohammed v university, um6p rabat, morocco elhachemi@emi.ac.ma abdessamad ait el cadi lamih, cnrs, umr 8201, f-59313, université polytechnique haut-de-france, insa hauts-de-france valenciennes, france abdessamad.aitelcadi@uphf.fr",

209,A Great Deluge Algorithm For University Examination  Timetabling Problem,"scheduling involves determining the start and the end time of resource assignments, events, or tasks to achieve a particular goal. a good schedule can increase the efficiency and the utilization of resources. the university examination timetabling problem (uetp) is an np-hard problem that determines the schedule of exams given students’ exam lists and limited period and room. this study proposes using a great deluge algorithm (gd) with local search operators to solve the uetp. the method is used to generate solutions for the uncapacitated toronto benchmark datasets. the proposed method shows promising results compared to the original great deluge algorithm and the modified great deluge algorithm available in previous literature.","uncapacitated, local search","This research proposes a great deluge algorithm to solve the Uncapacitated Examination Timetabling problem. Results suggest that in its current state, the algorithm can generate valid solutions. We also compared the solution of our proposed algorithm with the solutions from previous works. We believe our proposed algorithm can be further improved in future research. One way of improvement would be to write a more efficient code for the algorithm. Another avenue of research could be parameter tuning for each specific instance. We would also like to compare this algorithm directly with a SA algorithm in the future. Applying the algorithm with a real-world dataset would also be a possible future research topic.","lnasya syafitrie, komarudin department of industrial engineering, faculty of engineering universitas indonesia depok, indonesia lnasya.syafitrie01@ui,ac,id, komarudin74@ui.ac.id","references

However, the solutions given are still far from the current best-known solution for UUETP, where the gap of objective 
values varies between the instances. The smallest gap is in instance sta83 with a 0.84% difference, where sta83 is one 
of the smallest instances. The biggest gap is for instance pur93 with a 96.43% difference, where pur93 is one of the 
largest instances. This aligns with the fact that larger instances are more complex. Results also suggest that 
improvements to the solution could be done with better parameter tuning and a more efficient code. 
 
4.4 Parameter Testing 
Parameter testing is also done using analysis of variance to check parameters that have significant effects on the 
proposed algorithm. There are four parameters that are tested, each having three levels. The initial normality test 
indicates that the residuals are normally distributed, thus fulfilling the normality assumption. Table 7 shows the levels 
and p-values of the tested parameters. The analysis suggests that the tested parameters have no statistical significance 
towards the means of the objective value. Furthermore, interactions between factors also show p-values larger than 
0.05, suggesting no statistical significance. Therefore, it can be concluded that the suggested model can be used with 
minimal parameter tuning."
210,Green Manufacturing And State-Owned Enterprise Effect On  China’S Economic Growth,"this research was conducted to find out how the green manufacturing policy and state-owned enterprise (soe) performance are affecting china’s economic growth in the last 10 years. by using a qualitative approach based on secondary data, with the diamond theory of michael porter as an analytical tool, it can be said that the soe in china has an important role in economic development in china, while trying to adapt and improve their green policies.","china’s soe, diamond theory","State capitalism that is used by China is inseparable from their SOEs. Their role in China’s economic growth is very important and impactful to the extent that the Chinese government is willing to spend capital and policy to keep their SOEs running. The variables in diamond theory can determine whether a country is competitive or not. From the discussion sector, we saw that China excels Russia in several variables and it makes China more competitive than Russia. This research intends to show that despite the unique way China uses its SOEs, they still manage to grow its economy beyond everyone's expectations. But, their policy for their SOEs is changing and trying to adapt to the world economy. Green manufacturing also became one of the reasons why China’s economy is slowing down. Trying to adapt its policy to environmental issues as the basis of its industrial production. Hopefully, this research can become one of the guides for when scientists want to see the good and flaws in China’s policy on their SOE.","ferusi hibanavik student faculty of international relations bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia ferusi.hibanavik@binus.ac.id roseno aji affandi lecturer faculty of international relations bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia roseno.affandi@binus.ac.id",

It can be seen from the calculation above, each phase of product development process has different main challenges. However, unintegrated knowledge management activities remain the biggest challenge for all of the phase. Thus, an integrated system for knowledge management activities should be developed in order to facilitate the knowledge storage and conversion process from the knowledge management activities. Other than that, this study also calculated the most suitable knowledge management activities for each phase of product development process with AHP and TOPSIS. The results of AHP and TOPSIS for the most suitable knowledge management activities for each phase of the product development process are: 1. Knowledge repository for phase 1 (ideation and validation) 2. Talk rooms for phase 2 (design, integration and testing) 3. Formal training for phase 3 (commercialization, feedback and improvement) Suggestions that can be given for further research with similar topics are that research can be done by developing a knowledge management system and conducting a conformity analysis of the implementation in the company.","industry amalia suzianti and adhwa rana sausan department of industrial engineering universitas indonesia depok, west java, indonesia suzianti@eng.ui.ac.id, adhwa.rana@ui.ac.id",
212,A Supervised Learning Approach To Assessing Accounts  Receivable Risk In Small-To-Medium Enterprises,"information technology, e-commerce, and data analytics have drastically changed the way companies do business. few data related practices are more important than assessing risk; for example, the risk inherent in a firm’s accounts receivable (ar). while small-to-medium enterprises (smes) comprise a large portion of the global economy, they may be too small to devote extensive internal resources to risk analysis. at the same time, readily available risk related information may be ill suited to the needs of diverse smes. we explore the potential for readily available machine learning techniques, accessible to smes at modest cost, to assess the ar risk faced by a medium sized transportation brokerage, john j. jerue truck broker. of the models considered, linear discriminant analysis performed best when risk is modeled with three categories and decision trees performed best when there were two categories. our results demonstrate the potential for smes to develop risk assessments to flexibly meet their own diverse needs.",risk factors,"The final model was implemented in 2018 by the AR department at John J. Jerue Trucking. It is used to provide weekly updates on customers needing additional attention for collections purposes. The model is refreshed with new data based on corrections from AR experts over time and occasional resurveys. This prevents the model from stagnating and allows the company to adapt (nearly) continuously to both internal and external changes. Approaches to tailored risk modeling like the one presented have the potential to increase efficiency and profitability by focusing limited resources in an AR department where they are most needed. Although the subset and model selection used here should not be generalized to other businesses, the concept of tailored SME risk assessment can fill the gap between SMEs and large enterprises and FIs in a way that is suited to the diverse needs of SMEs. Despite its success, our approach has limitations. First, all information driving the model comes from within the company itself, posing an inherent risk of customer misclassification or potential bias. Future iterations might be improved by including other measures specific to the business, such as their credit score, obtained from other sources. This initial implementation also lacks additional functions that might be useful. For example, later designs might include automatically setting credit limits, credit blocking, and other functions where a speedy response might be crucial to prevent a negative outcome. A limited range of models was tested given the specific needs and situation of our particular case, pointing to opportunities for future work. Crook, Edelman, and Thomas (2007) provide a survey of major risk-of-failure studies that finds neural networks (NNs) perform best in a number of cases. However, we did not consider such models because the end users at John J. Jerue Truck Broker require an explanation of risk scores that can be impossible to discern from NNs due to their black box nature. However, NNs may prove useful in other SME contexts. Tsai (2008) models supply chain cash flow risks employing a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) simulation approach to modeling demand distribution, production, inventory, and sales. This approach might also prove useful in some SME settings. Michalski (2008) proposed a portfolio management approach to tracking and predicting operational risk that focuses on groups of customers and not individual customers, lending itself to optimizing a portfolio of AR as one might any group of financial assets. Development of such an approach would likely be useful in many SME contexts, including ours.

214,Driving Factors Analysis Of The Continuance Intention And  Brand Loyalty Of The Mobile Food Ordering Application,"the developing technology and the internet are directly proportional to the rise of internet users and mobile applications. this results in competitiveness among many companies. mobile applications have arisen as a distinct type of e-commerce that offers users convenience by saving them time and effort. moreover, as we are experiencing a pandemic, there is a shift in customers’ behavior towards food orders from offline to online ordering. thus, understanding the mobile application driving factors analysis is necessary. in response to this issue, this research is to develop a conceptual model, adopting the affordance-sdl theory and tam, and also to test the model by focusing on the outcomes of the continuance intention and brand loyalty of the mobile food application. a survey of 264 participants was conducted, and the data were analyzed using the partial least squares structural equation model (pls- sem). the main contribution of the results is the finding that out of 10 hypotheses, 9 hypotheses are accepted, and 1 hypothesis is rejected. this study provides a research model of how values and factors on mobile food ordering application drive people to be loyal and continuously use the mobile application regularly.","technology, acceptance model, mobile food, application, customer loyalty","The main objective of this study is to explore the role of mobile food ordering applications by developing a conceptual model of the driving factors focusing on the continuance intention and brand loyalty of the mobile food application. In order to fulfill the research objectives, this research begins with designing a conceptual model which is then tested using PLS-SEM software. From a total of 10 hypotheses, there is 1 rejected hypothesis and 9 accepted hypotheses. This means that visibility has a significant effect on value in MFOA usage. Then there's interactivity – active control, which has a big impact on the value of MFOA usage. In MFOA utilization, association–connectedness has a big impact on value. Additionally, selectivity – customisation and localisation have a substantial impact on the value of MFOA utilization. While persistence has no bearing on the value of MFOA consumption, it does have an impact. Furthermore, the value of MFOA usage has a substantial impact on MFOA retention and satisfaction. Then there's the MFOA satisfaction, which has a big impact on restaurant brand satisfaction and loyalty. Finally, customer happiness with a restaurant brand has a substantial impact on loyalty to that brand.

215,Multi-Period Vehicle Routing Problem With Cross-Docking  Using Split Pickups And Deliveries,"cross-docking provides benefits such as facilitating fast and direct unloading, consolidation, and reloading of goods from inbound to outbound trucks. the vehicle routing problem with cross-docking (vrpcd) is an extension of the vehicle routing problem with an additional constraint in which the depot has a role as cross-dock. the current paper provides a mixed-integer linear programming model for the vrpcd that considers multiple products, multiple vehicle types, and split pickups and delivery. based on the literature, we generated two sets of instances, one with a homogenous vehicle and one with heterogeneous vehicles. the instances are then solved using the gurobi solver. results show that instances with heterogeneous vehicles provide better results but require an increase in computation time (median of 37.3% for a 10-node instance with five types of vehicles). split pickups and deliveries can produce lower objective values and generate solutions previously infeasible. the computational results also show that smaller instances of 10 nodes can be solved in a reasonable amount of time. however, larger instances of 30 nodes are not optimally solved given a limited computation time of 1 hour.","cross-docking, delivery periods","We proposed a mixed-integer linear model of a VRPCD problem with multiple products, heterogeneous vehicles, split pickup, split deliveries, and available routes. However, in this case, we assumed that all routes are available for use. We also modified the VRP-MPCD benchmark instances to accommodate heterogeneous vehicles. The instances are solved using our proposed mixed-integer linear model with the Gurobi solver. Results show that instances with heterogeneous vehicles provide better results with a median of 37.3% for a 10-node instance with five types of vehicles. However, having heterogeneous vehicles require a longer computational time. A more efficient heuristic method can be used to solve larger problems, which can be done as an opportunity for future work. We also tested the advantages of having split pickups and deliveries, which can help at higher demand numbers and even produce solutions that were infeasible for the model without split pickups and deliveries. Other avenues of future work may also focus on formulating a model which ties delivery speed to the objective function.","muhammad mustafa ismail turner, komarudin department of industrial engineering, faculty of engineering universitas indonesia depok, indonesia muhammad.mustafa01@ui.ac.id, komarudin74@ui.ac.id",
216,A Photo-Realistic Simulation And Test Platform For  Autonomous Vehicles Research,"in this paper, we present an autonomous vehicles (av) research testbed with photo-realistic visualisation and simulation capability. compared to oak ridge national labs cave system, microsoft’s airsim, and matlab’s vehicle dynamics blockset approach, the key difference is a decoupled and modular system architecture which allows developers to focus on only one aspect of the whole system and be productive with minimal training. basically, the proposed system has a game engine, an external hardware accelerator for vehicle dynamical models, and a gpu equipped computer to run the ai algorithms. our vision is to have all vehicle dynamical models to be built in matlab/simulink and run on a hardware accelerator like speedgoat, which is a leading software and hardware framework for scientific system modelling and hardware in the loop simulation. the proposed photo realistic visualization environment is unreal engine based, and all ai models are keras based. this decoupled system architecture allows all vehicle dynamical models and ai decision making to be implemented outside the unreal engine, while the game engine doing all collision detections and reporting. similarly, all traffic and pedestrian movement stochastic models can be implemented outside the game engine, allowing a framework agnostic approach to be used throughout the whole system.","autonomous vehicles, ai algorithms, vehicle dynamics","In this paper, we have summarized the design of a low-cost testbed for AV research. Similar to the CAVE system of Oak Ridge National labs (Smith 2022), we have a photo-realistic environment built using a game engine. However, we have a decoupled system architecture with vehicle dynamical models built in MATLAB/Simunlink, traffic/pedestrian patterns realized in Python, and autonomous navigation algorithms running on a physically separate GPU equipped computer. The main advantage of this modular approach is, three or more different developers having completely different skills and technical background can work in a quite productive way with minimal training. Overall, the proposed system is expected to ease and accelerate AV research.

220,Prospective Strategies To Improve The Environmental  Sustainability Of The Copper Mining Industry In Peru,"the prospective is a tool that allows to generate future scenarios; however, there are only few studies regarding a prospective for the copper mining sector. the mining sector is very important for peru, since it contributes 10% to the national gdp and represents 65.7% of all exports. however, the processing of copper generates large environmental impacts, such as: gaseous emissions, particulate matter, dumping and hazardous solid waste. on the other hand, this is a strategic prospective study with a mixed approach, in order to determine future sustainable copper mining scenarios and contribute to the improvement of sustainability. in the methodology, the micmac was used to determine the key variables, the mactor and smic-prob-expert software to play the game between actors and define future scenarios respectively. for this reason, it is suggested that mining companies optimize the roasting, fusion and conversion processes. in addition, it is suggested that they control the management of contaminants in the copper concentrate, as well as increase the efficiency of the acid plant to levels greater than 99.99%. finally, 64 scenarios have been generated, of which it was considered that scenario 1 is the best sustainable scenario for the copper mining industry, since it has the highest probability of occurrence with 0.481 and it is where all the hypotheses are fulfilled.","mining, copper, sustainability","Compliance with the general objective is verified, which is the identification of possible future long-term scenarios. Likewise, regarding the first specific objective, the diagnosis of the current situation of the copper mining industry indicates that it has high levels of emissions of gases and particulate matter that in many cases exceed the LMP. Regarding the second specific objective, 31 variables were identified, which were validated by the experts. Also, in the third specific objective, the structural analysis was carried out, where the 6 key variables were determined and the relationships between actors were analyzed. Finally, in the fourth specific objective, the validation of findings was carried out where 64 future scenarios were generated. According to experts, the combination of the 5 variables within the EIA will allow achieving sustainable copper mining, which would be the best scenario. Therefore, for shareholders to be able to migrate towards a sustainability scenario, they must rethink the way in which the Environmental Impact Study (EIA) is going to be reformulated., In other words, the project must be oriented with a preventive approach on contamination and not from a corrective one.","gabriela chumacero-mamani and claudia rossana chávez-yánac graduated, faculty of engineering and architecture universidad de lima lima, lima, perú 20152848@ulima.edu.pe, 20173202@ulima.edu.pe edilberto miguel ávalos-ortecho professor, faculty of engineering and architecture universidad de lima lima, lima, perú eavalos@ulima.edu.pe",
221,K-Pop Idol Promoting Feminism In South Korea: A Case  From Red Velvet,"south korea has achieved remarkable success in promoting its pop culture products ranging from music to films. k- pop and k-drama are the two main exports that have helped to improve the country’s international image, aside from accumulating substantial economic gains. many k-pop idols are extremely popular, especially those in the boy and girl groups. yet, it is interesting to examine whether this fame will eventually help them to shape how fans are perceiving feminism? particularly amidst a deeply entrenched patriarchy society rooted in confucianism. using the experience of two members of the red velvet (a girl group) who openly expressing their support towards feminism, this study finds that the decision was deemed selfish and risking the entire group. the backlash that the idols received is rather harsh and exaggerated.","red velvet, korean feminism, k-pop, south korea","Nowadays, the word “feminism” seems to receive a rather negative connotation. A study by Bir (2021) suggests that most of the American public (85% among men and 65% among women) do not approve with being labelled as “feminist”. The perception towards the advocacy of improving women’s rights and gender equality has distorted into a more destructive rather than constructive movement. Furthermore, when celebrities are expressing their supports towards feminism, people might think that they merely seeking attention from the public and they get backlash from the general public. However, as discussed in the discussion section, this paper has demonstrated that when K-pop idols promote feminism in South Korea, the public opinion is divided between those who support and against. With the latter being more commonly found among fans, it is clear to suggest that feminism continues to be a taboo ideology in South Korea. Red Velvelt personals, Irene and Joy, were widely condemned for expressing their support towards feminism by liking a novel and wearing T-shirt that hardly reads “We Should All be Feminists” under her jacket. Due to the limited source of data being analyzed in this paper, more research is needed to explore as to how and why the stigma surrounding feminism has been so negative and deeply entreched in South Korea, aside from the Confuciasim which has been widely assumed reinforcing patriarchy in the country.

The study aimed to develop a low-fidelity prototype for an information system highlighting the application of Big Data solutions to village-level smart farms in the Philippines. The prototype developed in this study featured dashboards to deliver equivalent functionalities. The value of BD-SF technology must be matched to the needs of the targeted technology users. A potential early BD- SF adopter is between 27 to 42 years old, holds a science-related degree, has corporate experience, and is an experienced farmer who intends to continue to engage in farming, at least for the next five (5) years. To kick-start the sustainable adoption of BD-SF, at least ten (10) village-level farmers fitting this profile should be identified and organized into clusters to be supervised by a Cluster Technician. In turn, at least ten (10) of these clusters can be organized to form a group, to be headed by a Group Manager. In the systems analysis phase, the study engaged potential early adopters and cross-referenced their needs with available technologies in establishing the systems requirements for the proposed information system. Modeling tools and techniques such as the HIPO Chart, Systems Flow Chart, Use Case Diagram, and Data Flow Diagram highlighted the systems design phase. Defining the elements of the Data Stores explained the application of Big Data in optimizing crop yields forecast. Village-level data on yield estimate, vegetation indices, pest, and disease monitoring, and the relevant analytics can be generated from vegetation indices and data from sensors, remote-sensing, and drones. Farmer-level data are consolidated into Clusters, and subsequently, into Groups. The application of big data to smart farms in the Philippines was highlighted in the incorporation of dashboard analytics in the proposed information system. A low-fidelity prototype featured modules for three users – Farmer, Cluster Technician, and Group Manager. Use cases for managing the plan, managing gaps (against the plan), and generating reports culminated in the design of Farmer Dashboards, Technician Dashboards, and Group Manager Dashboards. These dashboards provided the access and visualization functionalities important to the stakeholders, represented in the study by the potential early adopters. Organizing the Group into Clusters and Farmers provided a good framework for managing both the physical and system environments. The Cluster Technician proposes the regular plans for the Farmers in the Cluster. In case of potential gaps against these plans, the Farmer reports these gaps while the Technician recommends the option to manage the gap. As a choice, Big Data help provide the best option based on village-level data. In both cases, the Group Manager decides on the critical steps in the Manage Gap and the Manage Plan processes. Updated Farmer, Cluster, and Group plans provide inputs for Big Data analytics to generate the user dashboards. The system modules developed for the Farmer, Cluster Technician, and Group Manager proved that Big Data solutions can be applied to village-level smart farms in the Philippine setting in improving crop productivity. Big data strengthened crop yield forecasting to provide farmers with the best option for the next crop while performing analytics to generate highly visual dashboards for the Farmer, Cluster Technician, and Group Manager. A similar system should find useful applications in the equivalent operational areas in the poultry, livestock, and aquaculture industries. Equally exciting is an application to the development of a coexistence system for genetically modified (GM) crops such as Golden Rice and Bt eggplant. The methodology applied in the study provides instructional value. The detailed steps involving the selected modeling tools represent a simple and effective illustration of the systems analysis and design process.

225,An Application Of Critical Chain And Lean Project  Management To Improve Project Efficiency: A Case Study Of,"a large of scaled development is ongoing in the industrial and infrastructure sectors in indonesia. megaproject especially in construction projects is considered disappointing due to over budget, delayed, and under quality. this lack of performance is due to the complexity and uncertainty of megaprojects. therefore, the aim of this study is to discover how to use lean practices to maximize project value, shorten the project schedule, improve project quality, and reduce waste in the construction industry. this was achieved by analyzing a case study of a construction project in indonesia. the case study revealed that implementation of critical chain project management as well as lean practices during the project, including the last planner system (lps) and continuous improvement, all contributed to the improvement of project performance. to supplement the case study and to provide insights on the differences between local and international lean construction (lc) practices, interviews with project stakeholders and a questionnaire survey of global lean experts were conducted. results indicated that interviewees and survey respondents both held the view that project waiting times and defects can be greatly reduced through the implementation of lc, and that improvement of construction workflow along with the project.","lean construction, critical waste","This study discussed the application of critical chain and lean project management to improve construction project efficiency. It is implemented in a case study of construction project of a large property construction company in Indonesia. The data being collected based on interview and survey process conducted prior to the project kick-off. The results shown that the critical construction path method is able to identify the activities considered as waste in the construction project. Addressing the waste with a proper lean construction tools shown that it is able to increase the project efficiency. The ability to manage concurrent projects in the dynamic and competitive modern economic environment becomes a key competence which may have a significant impact on building a company’s competitive advantage. The construction industry contributes significantly to economic development and social equality of both developed and developing countries (Jiang et al. 2019); adding between 7% and 10% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). A high level of asset specificity makes construction projects uncertain and complex with multiple requirements to be met during the design and construction process. Making project management practices sustainable is an essential component to the broader mission of making the construction industry, as a whole, truly efficient as well as sustainable. The outcome of this study will have a very positive implication for both theoretical and practical body of knowledge in project management. Theoretically, this study will provide a deep understanding of lean concepts and will encourage the construction companies to start a lean journey for removing wastes and inefficiencies from existing management techniques. The removal of waste within the construction projects will make construction more sustainable and facilitate in preserving not only the natural material but also the effort required to undertake the work. Thereby having a huge positive impact in decreasing the environmental issues associated with the construction industry (Nicholas and Steyn, 2020).","construction project in indonesia hwi-chie ho, selvi, gladysa valerie, ricky darmawan industrial engineering department, bina nusantara university, jakarta, indonesia 11480 a.a.n. perwira redi binus graduate program - master of industrial engineering, bina nusantara university, jakarta indonesia 11480 dimas prasetyo industrial engineering department, bina nusantara university, jakarta, indonesia 11480",

228,Optimization Approach For Quai Crane  Scheduling Problem Under A Combined,"most researchers have demonstrated the importance and the value of maritime terminal scheduling and optimization. the following work is focusing first, on the problem of unloading operations of outbound containers. thus, the sequencing of both quay crane and truck is studied at the same time. moreover, the possibility of potential interferences between quay cranes and the problem of shifting which significantly influence the performance of quay cranes is considered. in the literature, there is no work that combines interferences between quay cranes and shifting problem at the same time which is the innovation point of our work. the scheduling problem of the operations unloading containers is formulated as a mixed linear program model. the objective function is to minimize the makespan of handling operations by the quay cranes. the mathematical model is based on various assumptions and it includes the potential interferences and the shifting problem. after modeling the mixed linear program, we used ampl programming software to validate the mathematical formulation and to derive the optimization results. the solution obtained by ampl allows us to determine a completion time (483 seconds) for the processing of the 10 containers presented in the case study as well as the operation of each equipment and the working sequence of each (quay crane and truck).","optimization, quay crane, truck, container, synchronization","In this article, we presented a mathematical formulation of the problem of planning the operations of qard cranes and the movements of transport trucks. This formulation allowed us to integrate the hypothesis of the problem as well as the objectives assigned. Also, and with fictitious data, we solved the problem with the AMPL software. We obtained a solution with a completion time (483 seconds) for the processing of the 10 containers presented in the case study as well as the processing sequences of the various handling equipment set up in the maritime terminal. Solving with AMPL is the first approach to solving the problem. Then and in the context of the next step, we will try to solve the problem with a second resolution approach which is the genetic algorithm. In contrast to the approach used in this work the heuristic methods have the ability and efficiency to solve optimization problems regardless of the size of the problem: 10, 20 and 100 containers. The data that will be used to test the approach will be fictitious and multiple instances can be generated by varying the number of containers and/or handling equipment available.","constraints imane torbi student researcher, mechanical department national high school of electricity and mechanics ensem /hassan ii university casablanca, morocco torbi.imane@gmail.com sanae aidi student researcher, mechanical department national high school of electricity and mechanics ensem /hassan ii university casablanca, morocco sanaa.aidi@gmail.com mohamed mazouzi professor, mechanical department national high school of electricity and mechanics ensem /hassan ii university casablanca, morocco m.mazouzi@ensem.ac.ma",
229,Coordination Mechanism Among Key Players During  Disaster Relief Operations: A Case Study,"coordination in humanitarian operations has always been challenging due to the uncertainty and the complexity of the operations. because no one collaboration strategy fits all, the exploration of coordination mechanisms for a particular context is therefore necessary. the present paper aims at investigating the coordination mechanism among the key players and identifying challenges of coordination in relief operations in yogyakarta province, indonesia. qualitative research using semi-structured interviews focusing on coordination mechanism during the preparedness and response phases of humanitarian operations was conducted with representatives from governmental regional disaster management agency (badan penanggulangan bencana daerah – bpbd) in both provincial and district levels, governmental services, indonesian bureau of logistics, suppliers, and volunteers including non-governmental organizations. the findings entail that the hybrid coordination approach, characterized by a centralized structure combined with vertical and horizontal collaboration to ensure smooth aid procurement and distribution, has been implemented. the bpbd serves as a director that leads and coordinates the humanitarian operations with other involved stakeholders including other governmental services, local and international non-governmental organizations, and local and regional communities. the collaborations are engaged at the strategic, tactical, and operational levels. the findings have indicated that trust, uncertainty/unpredictability, lack of or limited technology for information sharing, effect of media, diversity of actors, political issues, resource scarcity were the main reported barriers toward coordination in humanitarian operations. avenues for potential future research are also discussed.","relief operations, case study","Coordination has been given special attention in the literature due to its significant role in effective and efficient humanitarian operations. It is believed that appropriate coordination mechanisms may be different for different contexts and situations. Hence, the present paper contributes to investigating coordination mechanisms among the key players and identifying challenges of coordination in relief operations in a case study of humanitarian operations in Yogyakarta province, Indonesia. The BPBD is responsible for humanitarian operations during the preparedness and response phase of the disaster. The preparedness phase regards disaster risk assessment and preposition inventory, whereas the response phase includes disaster assessment, evacuation, and last-mile distribution of aid supplies. Qualitative research using semi-structured interviews with the representatives from governmental regional disaster management agency (BPBD) in both provincial and district levels, governmental services, Indonesian bureau of logistics, suppliers, and volunteers including non-governmental organizations. The findings indicate that the provincial BPBD has adopted the hybrid coordination approach characterized by a centralized structure, which is combined with vertical and horizontal collaboration to ensure smooth aid supplies and deliveries. Strategic, tactical, and operational levels are also adopted for different humanitarian operations. The number and diversity of actors, uncertainty and unpredictability, the effect of media, resource scarcity, competition for funding, donor expectations, funding structure, cultural and knowledge barriers (different thoughts and perceptions), ego-sectoral, political issues, limited technology for sharing information (mostly using social media), trust were perceived to be the barriers.

233,Characterizing Adopter And Non-Adopter Of  Photovoltaic  System In Indonesia,"transitioning to renewable energy requires a micro approach at the household level as decision-makers. this paper investigates the characteristics of photovoltaic (pv) system adopters and non-adopters of photovoltaic (pv) systems in indonesian households to recognize household heterogeneity and explores empirical facts regarding the critical factors influencing pv system adoption. a survey of 450 households was conducted in 2020. the results showed that the adopter and non-adopter groups differed significantly in their activeness in seeking information about pv and the recommendations received for using pv. however, the effect of suggestions and sources of information was the same between the two groups. both groups have the same perception of the benefits derived from pv systems and the high investment costs. however, they are significantly different in perceptions of the complexity of using pv systems. the research shows that the adopter group is an early adopter, while the non-adopter group has late adopter characteristics. regarding environmental value, the two groups did not show a significant difference concerning the problem of awareness and responsibility for using renewable energy. however, they differed in willingness to pay more for using renewable energy. electricity bill reduction, energy independence, and environmental friendliness are the three primary motivators for adopting groups to install pv systems. meanwhile, in the non-adopter group, high installation costs, access to installation services, and lack of information were encountered as the main obstacles to adoption. the non-adopter group will be willing to use the pv system if given a 55% subsidy of the investment cost and when the payback period is not more than 8 years.","adopters, non-adopters, motivation",,"nurwidiana nurwidiana, bertha maya sopha and adhika widyaparaga mechanical and industrial engineering department universitas gadjah mada indonesia industrial engineering department sultan agung islamic university indonesia nurwidiana@mail.ugm.ac.id, nurwidiana@unissula.ac.id ,bertha_sopha@ugm.ac.id, adhika@ugm.ac.id","References

The results showed if insecurity has no significant impact on perceived ease of use and usefulness. Some issues that became the statements of discomfort and insecurity are the big problem for using the smartwatch. Also, the optimism result showed that optimism has no significant impact on perceived usefulness. In addition, the technology readiness index entirely plays a role in smartwatch use in Indonesia. Based on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) theory, if users feel it is easy to operate the technology, users will receive the benefits so that they decide to adopt the technology longer than when they used it when this research was implemented. With a very high path coefficient, users will continue to use their smartwatch in the future based on the existing attitude during use.","romadoni kevin julian and arian dhini department of industrial engineering universitas indonesia depok, indonesia romadoni.kevin@ui.ac.id, arian@ie.ui.ac.id",
236,Customer Clustering And Classification For Crm Loyalty  Program In Milk Powder Industry,"changes in lifestyle during the pandemic affect people's purchasing power and habits towards the need for baby food, especially dairy products, so that increasing profits and business competitiveness becomes an important part for companies which are engaged in procuring powdered milk for toddlers. one of the strategies to increase profitability and competitiveness is to increase customer retention by predicting customer loyalty and classifying customer profiles in the customer relationship management (crm) which is often also known as the customer loyalty program. this discussion tries to classify customer loyalty through customer profiles (demography, transactions, etc.) using techniques from data mining methods. beforehand, to classify the loyal and non-loyal customers as the objective of customer loyalty program, this study used cluster analysis to map the customers based on their behavior recorded in the transactions they made and the information they provided. the objective of this study is to answer several questions such as: is the predicted performance value of loyal customers accurate? and what variables are most important in classifying loyal customers? in addition, this study also aims to understand the use of data mining methods and how to interpret the results of the techniques that have been used. the dataset contains 655,625 observations and 20 variables while for cluster analysis, there are only 7 variables are being used whereby using this method, the optimal clusters obtained are 3 clusters. with the new labels for targeted variable, labels 0 and 1 are labeled as non-loyal customer and label 3 is the loyal customer where the proportion of each label are 76%, 15.18% and 8.82% then the proportion of non-loyal and loyal customers are 91.18% and 8.82%. using logistic regression method to classify loyal and non-loyal customers, the result showed that the model accuracy is about 96.6% where the misclassification error for the model is 3.4%. with this accuracy value, it can be recommended that this model can be used to classify customers in the customer loyalty program based on the dataset and variables that build the model.","data mining, k-means, customer loyalty","Loyal and non-loyal customers as seen in the model will affect several variables that make up, while the model does not affect several variables such as: month_2 (number of transactions in the second month), gram2 (total grams in the second month of transactions), is_product_2 and is_product_4 (stating the last registered product is product 2 and product 4) as well as the gender variable, either female or male. As a step to increase loyal customer the interval redeem variable (the time interval between the first date of redeeming the voucher and the last date of redeeming the voucher) was added and as shown in the classification model, this variable has a tendency to affect loyal or non-loyal customers with a slope value of 3.31e- 11. The Logistic Regression Model used is a Binomial Logistic Regression Model where the label variables used are binary variables 1 and 0 (Loyal and Non-loyal), As for classifying with label variables that have more than 2 categories, we will use the Multinomial Logistic Regression Model.","melky simorangkir, zulkarnain department of industrial engineering universitas indonesia selemba, jakarta, indonesia melky.simorangkir@ui.ac.id, zulkarnain17@ui.ac.id",
237,Circular Supply Chain System For Electric Vehicle In  Indonesia: A Conceptual Model,"in an effort to overcome environmental issues related to increasing greenhouse gas emissions, indonesia is one of the countries that has committed to supporting the use of electric vehicles to replace internal combustion vehicles. the potential increase in the use of electric vehicles creates a large potential for the generation of electric vehicles to reach the end of life (eol). this eol electric vehicle can pollute the environment if released into the environment. it will be very unfortunate if this consumable electric vehicle is left alone and becomes garbage even though it contains a limited number of metals. therefore, a circular supply chain (csc) system is needed in indonesia to reduce waste in the form of eol electric vehicles and reduce the need for raw materials for the manufacture of electric vehicles considering that the materials used are non-renewable. this research presents a conceptual model of the influential factors toward the csc implementation of electric vehicles in indonesia. the model was developed based on literature review and secondary sources analyses to capture both the difference between csc in indonesia and in developed countries based on the role of the informal sector in handling products that reach the eol. the informal sector is usually small in scale and uses simple technology. this means the recycling process carried out will result in greater pollution than using standard methods with adequate technology. this causes the csc system in indonesia to produce greater pollution than in developed countries, considering that the role of the informal sector cannot be eliminated in indonesia.","electric vehicles, recycle",,"karsi widiawati industrial engineering program, department of mechanical and industrial engineering universitasi gadjah mada (ugm) yogyakarta, indonesia karsiwidiawati@mail.ugm.ac.id bertha maya sopha industrial engineering program, department of mechanical and industrial engineering universitasi gadjah mada (ugm) yogyakarta, indonesia bertha_sopha@ugm.ac.id",
238,Design Of Ergonomic Computer Mouse Pad To Improve  Comfort And Reduce Mouse Elbow Injury,ergonomic design on a computer mouse is very important to prevent injury in the arm called mouse elbow. mouse elbow injury is a minor injury that occurs due to a hand position error when using a computer mouse. musculoskeletal disorder (msd) is experienced by workers who interact with computers intensively where fifty percent of mouse users experience msd. studies show that mouse use can cause several injuries such as: carpal tunner syndrome and other msds. designated injury is caused by the bending position of the wrist with a radical angle coupled with the overall movement of the fingers during the operation of the computer mouse. this research aims to design an ergonomic computer mouse by considering the msd injury factor so that computer mouse users can anticipate the occurrence of msd. the principle of anthropometry parallel to design thinking became the method used in this research. the results of this research are in the form of mouse design concepts that can accommodate the prevention of mouse elbow injury. the contribution of this research is exploring the optimal degree of freedom on elbow during the movement of using mouse computer.,"mouse pad, mouse elbow injury, ergonomic, orlando",,"ahmad tubagus d. p. assistant professor, industrial engineering department binus university jakarta, indonesia tubagus.ahmad@binus.ac.id ezra peranginangin assistant professor, industrial engineering department binus university jakarta, indonesia ezra.peranginangin@binus.ac.id nathania haryanto, adhelin jatsimin h. j. & jennifer giovanni product design engineering program binus university jakarta, indonesia",
239,"Life Cycle Cost For Micro, Small, And Medium-Sized  Enterprises In The Indonesian Food Industry","micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises are critical to a country's economic growth (msmes). nevertheless, the covid-19 pandemic affected a wide variety of business sectors. as a result, msme entrepreneurs must develop a strategy or plan for conducting business. one strategy that msme entrepreneurs can employ is to calculate life cycle costs to use them as a factor in future decision-making, as they are already aware of the processing costs. thus, it is hoped that msme entrepreneurs will avoid closing their businesses due to uncontrollable obstacles. this study aims to calculate the life cycle costs of msme food entrepreneurs by analyzing the flow of expenditure and revenue associated with operating the production machines used. by utilizing tofu producers in three different locations throughout indonesia, namely bekasi, cikampek, and karawang, this research will examine three machines: the soybean grinding machine, the water steam generation machine, and the water pump machine. following a literature review, it is determined that the machine's best life cycle cost will be the one with the lowest equivalent annual cost (eac). the best life cycle cost calculation was obtained for the soybean grinding machine in cikampek, with an eac of idr 20,665,699, -, for the water steam generation machine in cikampek, with an eac of idr 97,153,664,-, and for the water pump machine in cikampek, with an eac of idr 12,474,880,-. it can be seen that the wages for operating the same machine in different locations affect the choice of the best life cycle cost.","micro, small","The life cycle cost method is beneficial for determining a business's expenses and revenue. Financial flows are extremely sensitive for MSMEs, which can still be said to have a limited number of calculation elements and a small profit margin. Primarily to maintain or replace the machine in use, MSMEs can use this life cycle cost calculation to determine which costs can be reduced in a future crisis. According to this research, when three different locations are considered, namely Bekasi, Cikampek, and Karawang, the resulting life cycle cost calculation varies even when the same machine is used. The best life cycle cost calculation was obtained for the soybean grinding machine in Cikampek, which had an EAC of IDR 20,665,699, -, the water steam generation machine in Cikampek, which had an EAC of IDR 97,153,664,-, and the water pump machine in Cikampek, which had an EAC of IDR 12,474,880,-. As can be seen, wages for operating the same machine in different locations affect the best life cycle cost selection.","lia nur octavia and isti surjandari departement of industrial engineering universitas indonesia depok, west java lia.nur01@ui.ac.id, isti@ie.ui.ac.id",

242,Improving Rest Api Performances Using Design Patterns:  A Case In Healthcare Business Intelligence Systems,"managing a lot of data using a well-designed health information system can prevent medical errors and support doctors and medical service providers in providing the proper diagnosis to patients. this condition is inseparable from advances in data exchange technology commonly used, namely rest and soap. the rest api is beneficial in exchanging medical record data faster in real-time. problems then arise as time goes by, where transactions significantly increase, creating a longer access time. this study solves the problem by adding design pattern technology using a caching pattern. the data retrieval process on the web service is stored in the cache so that when retrieving data, there is no need to re-query the database and then update the cache on the web service and update daily using cron. this research uses a case study of a healthcare business intelligence system with various data taken from 3 different systems that have been integrated. tests were carried out in on-premise and cloud server environments with variations between 5,000 and 10,000 data and tested 50 times each. after using the catching pattern, the measurement results of on-premise web services show a reduction in response time of up to 87%. for further development, an additional service is needed to manage caches that are simultaneously entered into the server so that ram usage occurs optimally and does not cause data access time delays.","web service, rest, design pattern","This research aims to increase the speed of web service access by using design patterns in the health intelligence business. We have presented a caching design pattern approach on the rest server. The data used is data related to health, such as health complaint data, medical expenses, and employees. Any query data from the database is entered in the cache on the rest server. The database in this study is stored on the MongoDB database system. Caching patterns have weaknesses, such as the expiration of data that has to be updated. This study performed data updates on the cache using cron jobs that will be triggered automatically every time specified. Rest API are stored on cloud services with two processor cores and 4 GB of ram. Measurements were made on the client-side with a download speed of 20Mb / s and an upload speed of 5Mb / s. The results of the rest API measurement made with requests of 50 times and different amounts of data showed an increase in access speed of up to 87%. The speed of access rest API in the cache only increases in the request and response process, not the download speed. The result leads to a decrease in the speed of rest API access as the size of the data increases. This research proves the acceleration of access time after using caching patterns in rest APIs, which is very useful in intelligence business systems that use a lot of data. Suggestions for further development: An additional service is needed to manage the cache that enters simultaneously into the server so that the use of ram does not cause slow data access time lag.","devita dwitama putri baron department of informatics universitas jenderal achmad yani west java, cimahi, indonesia devitadwitama18@if.unjani.ac.id faiza renaldi and irma santikarama department of information systems universitas jenderal achmad yani west java, cimahi, indonesia faiza.renaldi@unjani.ac.id, irma.santikarama@lecture.unjani.ac.id",

244,The Practicality Of The Internet Of Underwater Things:   Matlab & Simulink Auv Application,"as oceans cover approximately 72% of the earth's surface, it is imperative to extend the internet of things (iot) principles to the existing bodies, paving the way for a new digital trend: the internet of underwater things (iout). the iout refers to the worldwide network of smart interconnected underwater objects, which enhances monitoring unexplored and vast water areas. it enables various applications like environmental monitoring, disaster prevention, and underground exploration. the internet of underground things with such applications is among the leading applied technologies in smart cities. this paper aims to focus specifically on determining the potential applications of the iout applications, which can help in examining the challenges that are and will be faced during its modeling and implementation. the study aims to investigate the challenges of designing and implementing such a network. the research includes communication networks and matlab & simulink simulation. based on previous reviews, an optimal network of iout enhances the development and integration of various systems for the robust evaluation of water ecosystems. the study's outcomes include a tested auv simulation model, which is a crucial part of an iout system that can be adjusted to suit local water conditions. the idea of iout should be embraced due to its positive impact on social and economic factors.","iout, plant model, communication, sensors, relays","A new class of IoT was investigated: the Internet of Underwater Things (IoUT). It has been proven that it is among the common technologies that will enhance the development of smart cities, which will help take the traditional communication systems to the next generation. Moreover, it helps society in preserving underwater natural resources. Despite the trend of this contemporary topic, only a few studies have been carried out concerning the topic; however, most have not addressed the efficiency and practicality of the system. AUVs play a critical part in the IoUT technology and the implementation of the Smart Ocean. There are, however, concerns and obstacles that must be handled initially. The majority of the problems are caused by several AUVs in a large-scale network which is potentially inefficient to maintain (unsustainable) because every element in the system is dependent on the other: the more elements, the wider the range of error.

It goes well beyond quality departments or the quality profession. Due to the data centered nature of Industry 4.0 and the established data skills and focus of the quality profession, Quality 4.0 may be an appropriate strategic approach to the implementation of Industry 4.0 technologies for the purpose of improved business performance. The context of the business and its core competencies and market strategies are relevant in determining how to initiate a digital transformation and Quality 4.0 is not the only appropriate approach to Industry 4.0 technology deployment. Quality professionals are well positioned within organizations to enhance digital transformation strategies, and quality driven digital transformation should be considered by companies with quality as a key business focus.","thomas jones doctoral candidate, department of industrial engineering and management systems university of central florida orlando, florida, usa tom.jones@knights.ucf.edu ahmad k. elshennawy professor, department of industrial engineering and management systems university of central florida orlando, florida, usa ahmad.elshennawy@ucf.edu",
248,The Effect Of Social Media Marketing On Marketing  Performance In Higher Education During Covid-19,this study aims to identify the direct and indirect effect of social media marketing use on marketing performance in a university during the covid-19 pandemic and customer satisfaction as an intervening variable. the research data is collected through questionnaires and literature studies methods. questionnaires are distributed to students of the 2020/2021 and 2021/2022 academic years. the analytical method used in this quantitative research is the pls- sem approach using smartpls software version 3.3.4. this study shows that social media marketing has a positive and significant direct and indirect effect (intervened by customer satisfaction) on marketing performance.,college,"were drawn based on the original sample values , which were all positive values (Hair et al., 2017) and T-Statistics, which were all greater than 1.96 (Avkiran & Ringle, 2018). From these results, it is found that there is a positive and significant influence both the direct influence of Social Media Marketing on Marketing Performance and indirectly through Customer Satisfaction. This proves that all research hypotheses are proven, especially the first hypothesis (H1) and the fourth hypothesis (H4), which this research wants to prove. According to (Cepeda et al., 2017), a condition where direct and indirect effects have a significant influence represents partial mediation. Hair also explained that partial mediation occurs when a mediator variable partially explains the relationship between exogenous and endogenous constructs (Hair et al., 2017). Then, the results of hypothesis testing also show that the direct and indirect effects both have a positive direction. In addition, Hair also believes that partial mediation can be broken down into Complementary Partial Mediation and Competitive Partial Mediation. Complementary Partial Mediation is used to describe situations where the direction of influence of direct and indirect influence points in the same direction, while Competitive Partial Mediation is used to describe situations where the direction of influence of direct and indirect influences points in the opposite direction (Hair et al., 2017). Therefore, it can be concluded that the type of mediation that occurs in this research model is Complementary Partial Mediation. 4. Conclusions and Suggestions 4.1 Conclusion From these results for the formulation of the first problem, social media Marketing directly influences Marketing Performance. The second problem is, Social Media Marketing has an indirect influence on Marketing Performance through Customer Satisfaction. It is found that the influence of Social Media Marketing on Marketing Performance is positive and significant both in terms of directly and indirectly through Customer Satisfaction. The direction of the same influence and the level of significance indicates that the type of mediation in the research model is Complementary Partial Mediation. For the third problem, the satisfaction of students who register from online registration during the pandemic for the 2020/2021 and 2021/2022 academic periods at a university, it can be concluded from the survey results of respond that 85% of respondents answered that they were satisfied with the performance of the university.

254,"The Effect Of Time Budget Pressure, Task Complexity And  Professional Commitments On Reducing Audit Quality","the purpose of the research was to determine the effect of time budget pressure, task complexity and professional commitment on reduced audit quality in tangerang and south tangerang. this research used primary data, and the amount of sample is 81 respondents. the sampling technique used simple random sampling. the data analysis technique used multiple linear regression analysis. the result showed that time budget pressure positively affects reduced audit quality. in comparison, task complexity and professional commitment do not affect reduced audit quality. this research only explains 10,1% of factors influencing reduced audit quality, while the remaining 89,9% is explained by other variables not included in this research model.",task complexity,"and Suggestion From the results of research and discussion used in accordance with the objectives of the hypothesis conducted by multiple regression analysis, the following conclusions can be drawn: 1. Time Budget Pressure influences Audit Quality Decrease. From the results of tests that have been done, the first hypothesis can be accepted with a significance value of 0.024 <0.05, which means Time Budget Pressure has a positive influence on the decline in audit quality. This means that the higher the Time Budget Pressure perceived by the auditor, the higher the auditor's tendency to take actions that can reduce audit quality. 2. The complexity of the task does not affect the Decrease in Audit Quality. From the results of tests that have been done, the second hypothesis is rejected because the significance value is 0.104> 0.05. It is possible that this could happen because auditors in the Tangerang and South Tangerang regions have a clear understanding of the work they are doing and the existence of a team that is present in every audit assignment so that it can help ease audit work. 3. Professional Commitment does not affect Audit Quality Decrease. From the results of tests that have been done, the third hypothesis is rejected because the significance value is 0.914> 0.05. This happens because the majority of respondents are junior auditors who have only 1-2 years of experience and are not fully committed to their profession. Therefore, the level of professional commitment does not affect the auditor in taking actions that can reduce audit quality. 4. The most dominant variable in decline in audit quality is Time Budget Pressure. Judging from the results of the regression test, obtained standardized beta coefficients of 0.237. During the research process, there were some limitations. The limitations in this study are: 1. The results of the study only reflect the condition of auditors in the Tangerang and South Tangerang regions. 2. The number of respondents is less varied. With the majority of respondents being junior auditors who only have 1-2 years of audit experience, they are only able to measure the perception of junior auditors. 3. This study did not conduct a pilot study due to time constraints, so there is one question that is not valid. 4. This study only uses three independent variables, where the three variables can only explain 10.1% of the factors that can reduce audit quality so that the remaining 89.9% is explained by other variables that have not been examined in this study.

256,The Effect Of Emotional Intelligence And Locus Of Control  On The Work Stress And Its Implication On The Satisfaction,"this research aims to study how emotional intelligence and locus of control affect job stress and its implication for job satisfaction among sales staff at financial technology business unit xyz bank. this associative research uses a quantitative method with path analysis as a data analysis technique. this study shows that in a sample of 140 salespeople, emotional intelligence and locus of control have a negative and positive effect on job stress. job stress also has a significant role in strengthening how emotional intelligence and locus of control affect job satisfaction. this study concludes that emotional intelligence and locus of control affect job satisfaction both directly and indirectly. the recommendation is to implement an employee assistance program and compile a training handbook.","job satisfaction, locus of control","and Suggestion There is a significant influence between emotional intelligence and locus of control simultaneously by 42% on work stress on sales staff in the financial technology business unit of PT Bank XYZ. Partially, emotional intelligence has a significant effect on work stress with the nature of a negative relationship. At the same time, the locus of control also has a significant influence and a positive relationship with work stress. Then, there is a significant influence between emotional intelligence, locus of control and work stress simultaneously at 81.5% on job satisfaction among sales staff in the business unit of PT Bank XYZ. Where partially, job stress has an effect of 43.03%, which is significant and is negative on job satisfaction. Emotional intelligence has a significant direct effect and is positive on job satisfaction. In addition, there is an indirect effect between emotional intelligence and job satisfaction through work stress. There is also an indirect effect between locus of control and job satisfaction through work stress. The results showed that locus of control significantly affected work stress. In addition, locus of control has a direct effect and an indirect effect through job stress on job satisfaction variables. Locus of control has a negative and significant relationship to job satisfaction. Thus, job satisfaction will increase for every shift in the locus of control toward the internal locus of control. Based on the discussion, conclusions, and research implications, it can be recommended: 1. The HR department can create an Employee Assistance Program where employees can consult through telephone lines, the company's internal web, online communication applications, or meet privately with company representatives appointed to handle mental health-related issues. Where employees can consult or talk about problems and complaints that are not only limited to the scope of work. This program is expected to be a solution for employees with a low level of emotional intelligence and external locus of control to increase sales staff job satisfaction both directly and by reducing work stress. 2. Compile an annual Training Handbook that lists training programs that exist in that year for employees from all levels, both team leaders and team members. The list of training prepared should be the training that is needed based on the results of the performance evaluation or condition of the employee at the end of the previous year. Based on the research results, one example of training that companies currently need is stress management, locus of control, and emotional intelligence. With a well- structured training plan, it is expected to increase the job satisfaction of sales staff. 3. Implement a Gainsharing Plan in an existing Performance-Based Reward where rewards are given to the team so that it can reduce the individual workload and foster teamwork. It is expected that employee work will be reduced and can improve good relations between employees. This can simultaneously improve labour efficiency. The results showed the characteristics of respondents based on gender, age, last education, and length of work. From the research results, most sales staff are women in the 22-25 years age group. Most are high school or vocational high school graduates and have only worked for less than one year. Table 2 shows the mean and standard deviation of the variables of emotional intelligence, locus of control, job stress, and job satisfaction.","of sales staff of financial technology business unit of pt bank xyz i herisetyantri management department, binus business school undergraduate program, bina nusantara university, jakarta, indonesia 11480 m j elvansyah management department, binus business school undergraduate program, bina nusantara university, jakarta, indonesia 11480 vincentia janice management department, binus business school undergraduate program, bina nusantara university, jakarta, indonesia 11480 engkos achmad kuncoro management department, binus business school undergraduate program, bina nusantara university, jakarta, indonesia 11480 eakuncoro@binus.ac.id",

Liquidity has a significant effect on tax aggressiveness. This shows that banking companies are less able to meet their short-term obligations. 2. Leverage does not affect tax aggressiveness. This means that banking companies do not use debt to minimize their tax burden. 3. Profitability does not affect tax aggressiveness. This means that banks have a high profitability value so that banks do not experience difficulties in meeting company obligations, namely tax payments. 4. Company size does not affect tax aggressiveness. This means that banking companies are classified as large and overseen by many investors and banking supervision bodies. 5. Liquidity, Leverage, Profitability and Size of the company have a joint (simultaneous) effect on tax aggressiveness. Based on the conclusions and limitations above, the suggestions for further researchers are as follows: 1. It is expected to use other variables that affect tax aggressiveness, such as independent commissioners, corporate social responsibility, capital intensity, etc. 2. It is expected to extract data from companies other than banking companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange, such as mining, agricultural, or real estate companies. 3. It is expected that the Financial Services Authority will further improve supervision of the company's financial ratios.

The conclusions obtained from the results of this study are as follows: 1. Transparency has a significant positive effect on wise netizens on social media (Facebook). It can be concluded that if the transparency of netizens on social media tends to be good, it will lead to netizens who are wiser in using social media. The effect of transparency on wise netizens is evident in the increasing number of users who provide information correctly to create inter-users trust and the decrease in the spread of hoaxes and hate speech. 2. With increasing netizen accountability in using social media, netizens' policies will also increase. This is consistent with the research results in which accountability has a significant positive effect on wise netizens on social media (Facebook). The impact of influencing accountability on wise netizens is mutual respect and respect for opinions among social media users, not excessive in expressing comments (balanced), understanding the meaning of a comment, and reducing the spread of gossip and other irresponsible information.

The first hypothesis is accepted that the net profit margin positively affects the stock price. 2. The second hypothesis is accepted that book value positively affects the stock price. 3. The first hypothesis is accepted that company size positively affects the stock price. Research that has been done has limitations, i.e.: 1. The sample used in this study is limited to manufacturing companies in the consumer goods industry sector. 2. The period used in this study is only three years, namely 2015 to 2017. 3. The independent variables used in this study are only three independent variables, namely net profit margin, book value, and company size. Based on the conclusions and limitations that have been explained before, then some suggestions can be given, i.e.: 1. Based on tests that have been carried out, net profit margin, book value, and company size have a positive and significant effect on stock prices. In addition, the results of the F test conclude that the net profit margin, book value, and company size together influence the stock price, so investors should pay attention to these three variables when analyzing stocks and making investment decisions. 2. The ability of independent variables to explain the dependent variable is 64.1% and 35.9% explained by factors other than the net profit margin, book value, and company size. Researchers can then use ratios that are likely to affect stock prices and help do fundamental analyses such as price to book value, debt to equity ratio, and earnings per share. Price to book value can provide information to prospective investors about the fair value of stock prices so that potential investors can find out whether the stock price that is currently outstanding is undervalued or overvalued. Earnings per share can help potential investors estimate the profits earned by investors per share they own. 3.

260,The Effect Of Net Working Capital And Good Corporate  Governance On Working Performance Of Companies By,"this study aimed to analyze the influence of net working capital and ownership structure against company performance measured by economic value added (eva). the research object was consumer goods companies listed on indonesia stock exchange from 2014 to 2016. the dependent variable of this study was company performance, and the independent variables were net working capital, managerial ownership, and foreign ownership. statistical analysis tools used in this research were multiple linear regression and test using stata for windows version 12,4. the results show that variable concentration of foreign ownership significantly influences economic value-added while net working capital and managerial ownership did not significantly influence economic value added.",net working capital,"for this partial test is that the two variables accept Ho, while in FOWN (foreign ownership), it is explained that P> | t | smaller than 0.05, which is valued at 0.010. Thus, the foreign ownership variable is stated to reject Ho and is stated to be significant in accepting alternative hypotheses. Table 4. Partial t-test value Hypothesis Explanation Result H-1 Net Working Capital does not significantly influence Company Performance Accept Ho H-2 Managerial Ownership does not significantly influence Company Performance Accept Ho H-3 Foreign Ownership significantly influences Company Performance Reject Ho dan Accept H3 3.3 Regression Analysis Results Based on Table 4 above, multiple linear regression analysis in this study was conducted using net working capital (NWC), managerial ownership (MOWN) and managerial foreign (FOWN) as independent variables, company performance as the dependent variable. Y = 24,762 + 2,426 X1 + 0,819 X2 – 1,827 X3 + e 4. Conclusion 1. Net Working Capital has no significant effect on Company Performance. Table 1 outlines the companies GGRM, KLBF and WIIM in the three periods that continue to experience an increase in net working capital. In 2014 GGRM had an NWC of 0.253, in 2015 of 0.291 and in 2016 of 0.322. In 2014 KLBF had an NWC of 0.461, in 2015 of 0.466, and in 2016 of 0.476. In 2014 WIIM had an NWC of 0.419, in 2015 of 0.481 and in 2016 of 0.519. So, this study stated the large proportion of net working capital means the company cannot manage working capital properly so that the company has decreased profitability. Therefore, EVA measurement tools which are stated as working capital measurement media, can give results that the company has not been significant in providing added value to the company. Under these circumstances, the hypothesis made by the researcher is supported by research conducted by (Anggarani D., &Ficilia, 2014). 2. Managerial ownership does not significantly influence Company Performance. In Table 1, the data presented by the author are only 27 proportion of managerial ownership owned by the consumer goods sector of 78 with a total percentage of 49%. The lack of managerial ownership cannot be felt by the contribution of the manager's responsibility because not all profits obtained by the company can be enjoyed by management. This gives the possibility that there will be less than optimal management by management. Therefore, the results of the study are supported by research conducted by Vani (2017: 129) as well as the results of the study are also in line with research by (Wida, NP PD, 2014). So that the possibility of managerial ownership that was studied was also obtained with a small percentage so that the EVA carried out by management could not yet feel the benefits for the company. 3. Foreign ownership has a significant positive effect on Company Performance. In Table 1, there are 37 samples that have foreign ownership, and in the percentage of foreign ownership, the average percentage owned by foreign parties is high. Therefore, the high percentage of foreign Proceedings of the 7th North American International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management, Orlando, Florida, USA, June 12-14, 2022","economic value added (eva) measurement in the goods consumer sector companies listed in idx 2014-2016 silvia julianty accounting department, school of accounting, bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia 11480 setiani putri hendratno accounting department, school of accounting, bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia 11480 setiani.hendratno@binus.ac.id","References

261,Factors Affecting Internet Financial Reporting On Banks  Listed On Indonesian Stock Exchange 2013-2017,"the fast development of the internet nowadays attracts many companies to start using the internet to deliver information about company financial or nonfinancial information. using the company website because of lower cost and pervasiveness. this study aims to determine the leverage ratio, profitability ratio, and listing age of banking companies listed on idx 2013-2017. it significantly affects how banking companies use internet financial reporting. this study uses a statistic descriptive test, classic assumption test as normality test, multicollinear test, heteroscedasticity test, and autocorrelation test. the multiple linear regression and hypothesis tests, both partial t-test and simulant f-test are done using 127 samples from 27 banking companies. this study shows a significant effect on leverage, profitability, and listing age. for partial test from three variables shows that only listing age has a significant impact on internet financial reporting, profitability and leverage have no considerable effect on internet financial reporting.","leverage, profitability","and Suggestion 4.1 Conclusion This research has passed a series of tests to ensure the data used is appropriate as research material. A total of 127 sample data consisting of 25 companies have passed the classic assumption test, test, and hypothesis test, so the results of the study are stated as follows. The independent variable of leverage is stated not to find empirical evidence that proves to have an influence on internet financial reporting with a positive coefficient value. If there is an increase in the leverage ratio, it increases the possibility for more disclosure to internet financial reporting. The results of this study are in line with previous studies conducted byMaharani (2017), Puri (2011), and Saher (2014). The independent variable of profitability is stated not to affect internet financial reporting with a positive coefficient value. If there is an increase in the profitability ratio, it increases the possibility for more disclosure to internet financial reporting. It is because the high value of profitability will make an investor and other outsiders put trust in the company. The results of this study are in line with previous studies conducted byMaharani (2017),Puri (2011). The age-independent variable of the listing is stated to have an influence on the internet financial reporting with a positive coefficient value. If there is an increase in the age ratio of the listing, it increases the possibility for more disclosure to internet financial reporting. The results of this study are in line with previous studies conducted by Chariti and Lestari (2007) and Maulida, Noor, & Nurul (2017).Due to the many experiences of companies that have a longer-lasting life. Hence, they are more aware of the completeness of any item. It will facilitate access to investors' and outsiders' needs. Simultaneous Significance Test Results The simultaneous significance test is conducted to find out how much influence the independent variable together on the dependent variable.

262,Automated Recognition And Prediction Of Wildfires,"wildfires represent both ecological and economic disasters that significantly affect our planet. the traditional tools to detect fires are not useful in large open areas such as forests. currently, there is limited work to provide intelligent tools that can assist in understanding, detecting, fighting, or predicting wildfires. recently, there has been some initiatives to develop such capabilities. however, these initiatives are in the early stage and additional contributions are needed. our work, using machine learning and pattern recognition techniques, presents an initial attempt in developing a model that is capable of autonomously recognizing wildfires, determining their size and intensity, and making some prediction about their potential spread. our initial model is based on convolutional neural networks and utilize images collected from nasa’s website combined with the meteostat library to create a spatiotemporal composite data set. the data include—but not limited to—positional data, fire temperature from the ti4 and ti5 sensors, fire radiative power, and the timestamp information. this data is used to determine the areas in which the fires are burning, along with the strength of the fires, which will eventually allow the system to determine the spread of wildfires. we also hope that this project will increase the awareness of this important problem.","pattern recognition, machine learning",,"mazin al hamando department of mathematics and computer science lawrence technological university southfield, mi 48075, usa malhamand@ltu.edu",

The significance value is lower than 0.05 (0.044 < 0.05), so it can be concluded that the number of shares issues significantly influences the level of underpricing. The coefficient of -0.062 shows the negative direction from this variable towards underpricing. The significant negative effect shows an inverse correlation between the number of shares offered and the underpricing level. The number of shares offered and underpricing level move in opposite directions as the smaller the offering size will increase the underpricing level, and the larger the offering size will decrease the underpricing level. A large number of shares sold to the secondary market will affect the decision of the investor to purchase the shares Proceedings of the 7th North American International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management, Orlando, Florida, USA, June 12-14, 2022","illen meilinda accounting department, school of accounting, bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia 11480 yen sun accounting department, school of accounting, bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia 11480 ysun@binus.edu","References

The variable Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) in trading and service companies from 2013 to 2016 has a p-value of 0.0361 which means it is smaller than α = 0.05, indicating that CSR influences tax aggressiveness, while the coefficient value on the number 0.177957 shows that CSR has a positive effect on ETR, but has a negative effect on tax aggressiveness. High CSR disclosure figures indicate that the company cares and pays attention to environmental and social conditions in carrying out its operational activities. Companies that are aggressive towards taxes have relatively low transparency. Therefore, companies that disclose large amounts of CSR should pay taxes properly. In other words, H1 can be accepted. 2. The gender variable Chief Financial Officer (POST) in trading and service companies from 2013 to 2016 has a p-value of 0.1324 which means it is greater than α = 0.05 with a coefficient value of 0.017843, indicating that POST does not influence tax aggressiveness. In previous studies, it can be concluded that gender does not affect tax compliance and tax morals. In this study, both men and women have the same treatment of tax aggressiveness. In other words, H2 is rejected. 3. The majority ownership variable (FAM) in trading and service companies from 2013 to 2016 has a p-value of 0.9448 which means it is greater than α = 0.05 with a coefficient of -0,000937, indicating that FAM does Proceedings of the 7th North American International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management, Orlando, Florida, USA, June 12-14, 2022","tax aggressive behavior (empirical study on trade and service sector companies listed on indonesia stock exchange 2013-2016) priscilia, levana dhia prawati accounting department, school of accounting, bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia 11480 levana.prawati@binus.ac.id","References

Because employee performance will not improve if only the work environment is improved, it is better to do it together with other factors. Since work motivation does not significantly influence employee performance, the company does not need to make efforts to improve or pay attention to it. Because employee performance will not improve if only the work environment is improved, it is better to do it together with other factors. Considering that transformational leadership variables have a significant effect on employee performance, it is suggested that company leaders should communicate persuasively to their employees, pay direct attention to employees, put themselves in problems that are considered difficult by employees and give employees free opinions. Something that can provide positive input for leaders and for the company itself.

269,Application Of Network Models To Assist In Data Science  Curriculum Using Program And Course Learning Outcomes,"creating a robust curriculum is key to ensuring success in an academic degree. this paper provides insight into the use of data science tools to enhance curriculum mapping in higher education. using course learning outcomes and program (degree) learning outcomes, a network map is produced to ensure synthesized outcomes that can allow for great success of a program and enforce student education. based off this project, different departments and universities can obtain insightful information about their own curriculum and how successful their curriculum mapping is. students can also benefit from seeing the way course learning outcomes map to their program learning outcomes which could guide them through their studies and future careers.","curriculum analysis, data science, network modeling","and Future Work Throughout the project, the goal was to create a mapping tool to show the relationship between various variables in a course. Course learning outcomes were mapped to program learning outcomes with the respective Bloom’s Taxonomy Level. Each core course in the Data Science program at Florida Polytechnic University was mapped to a Program Learning Outcome. A table was then produced to show how course content (pulled from the syllabus) is mapped to course learning outcomes. This table shows that everything being taught in a course needs to have a purpose and if it does not have a purpose, then it needs to be updated. In the future, this tool can be improved to allow more content to be output. Courses that do not necessarily have a Bloom’s Taxonomy word in the CLO, would output a Bloom word based on the information in the course learning outcome. This would allow for less manual input from faculty and can improve the way CLO’s are written and mapped. When mapping course learning outcomes to course outline, some text mining tools were used to create more authentic results when pulling out matching words in the CLO and course outline. Although this did not change the entirety of the content of the course outline, certain words or numbers were dropped from the outline which might create some confusion with certain course outline descriptions. This could be further developed to incorporate a dictionary that would not change some words or remove only specific words, numbers, or patterns. Incorporating a tool that would also analyze assessment data for the different CLO’s would be an additional feature that can be created in the future. This would allow faculty to have access to everything on one dashboard and can give complete insight to a course from start (CLO mapping) to finish (assessment). Assessment data would include items like students success rate or which CLO had the most successful assessment. An additional tool that could be created based on this work would be to automate a syllabus that would include this mapping tool and include necessary information. Faculty would have access to this file and can simply click their course, and would be able to see the new syllabus created. This would allow for better insight for a student or faculty member and can create a uniform syllabus for all courses in a university. Some preliminary work has been done to start implementing this tool. In the two final tabs of the flexdashboard, there is a tab called “Example Syllabus (Prototype)” and “Future Implementation”. Ideally, the example syllabus tab is the format of the different tools being applied to what the possibility of a syllabus could look like. Each tool used in this project would be outputted based on the different course syllabus wanted to be produced.

270,Development Of Covid-19 Regional Forecast Models Using  Machine Learning Approaches,"the present work predicts different parameters key to a proper covid-19 response, through machine learning methods. the number of patients affected, hospitalizations, and deaths in the context of the state of florida is considered to provide a blueprint for regional pandemic response. to predict these variables, twenty inputs in four categories (type of tests performed, gender, race, and age group) were collected. official data from the florida state department of health were collected and submitted to a linear regression model, fuzzy logic model, and long short-term memory (lstm) deep learning model with the intent of producing predictions as close as possible to the actual numbers. the mean absolute percentage error (mape) was calculated to measure the deviation of the predicted result from the actual values. in addition, a one-way analysis of variance (anova) models was developed for each output parameter to statistically assess the results of these models. the lstm deep learning model outperformed the fuzzy model, which in turn outperformed linear regression, in terms of the mape for the ‘number of florida residents affected’. for the ‘number of patients hospitalized’, the lstm deep learning model again outperformed the regression model, while the regression model and the fuzzy model were not significantly different. for ‘the number of patient deaths’, however, no model significantly outperformed any other. these findings suggest that in regional data, the fuzzy model outperforms linear regression, and the lstm deep learning model outperforms both the fuzzy model and the linear regression model. implications of this work include a better understanding of opportunities and appropriate tools for short-term prediction of future trends when variability is high, as well as replacement strategies for datasets with missing values.","covid-19, lstm deep learning, fuzzy logic, linear regression, mape",,"md mamunur rashid, ben d. sawyer department of industrial engineering and management systems, university of central florida, orlando, florida - 32816, united states mdmamunur.rashid2@ucf.edu, sawyer@ucf.edu",
271,Improving Patient Experience And Processing Times In A  Major Metropolitan Hospital Through The Application Of A,"adventhealth’s orlando south emergency department’s (ed) pink pod, or lean pod, routinely provides some of the best patient satisfaction and processing time results in adventhealth eds in the central florida region; however, there are numerous opportunities to improve the process further by addressing systemic bottlenecks within existing operating procedures. the team sought to find opportunities to accomplish this while also establishing best practices and finding weaknesses within the existing system. here we report the results of our lean six sigma (lss) effort toward improving an area of the ed that, statistically, is operating well but has the potential to perform even better. the team conducted explorative observations and interviews with pink pod medical staff and leadership to get a better understanding of existing procedures as well as employee concerns relating to pink pod processes and analyzed historical data collected and provided by adventhealth to identify trends and key statistics. ultimately, the team was able to pinpoint several causative factors affecting patient time-in-system and satisfaction, including issues with communication between departments, transportation of patients, the triage process, the implementation of team nursing, and gathering and disposing of equipment for use with or on patients. remedying these issues helped to alleviate potential areas for delay and led to increased patient satisfaction and less time spent in the ed for patients in the pink pod. as a result of the project, adventhealth has addressed many of the issues the team discovered, including: adding more equipment, such as sharps bins; standardizing staffing with core groups of personnel for pink pod; and revisiting their registration and triage process to help ensure patients are evaluated properly before being assigned to their bed in the ed.","healthcare, lean, six sigma","The results of our study provided several areas for improvement for the Pink Pod as well as for the ED and AdventHealth as a whole. The team recommends an improvement to the onboarding process for new employees which will introduce them to Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) based on the PMAPs the team developed for the key processes a patient will pass through during their time at the ED. Recommendations also include providing a binder in the Pink Pod with these SOPs as well as any relevant common health or safety information in case an employee is unsure of how a task is completed or how to deal with a certain situation they may face in the Pink Pod. Difficulties were encountered in attempting to obtain and utilize data for certain time-based metrics; specifically, the time taken for the imaging process (excluding transport time). This was identified as a major item that the nurses waited on in the treating of patients as per Fig. 7, thus motivating investigation into the time associated with this time item. However, it was found over the course of the study that this data was recorded manually, and thus was sufficiently low fidelity as to warrant its dismissal during the course of the performed analysis. This then presented the team with difficulties in placing numerical values on the savings to be had through the implementation of various measures as a share of the magnitude of the patients’ time-in-system. Communication problems were evident between leadership and the workforce. In several instances, employees were asked to explain the process behind certain tasks. There was a high level of variance in response depending on the level of experience of the employee as well as how long they’ve worked within Pink Pod. This contrasts with what was explained to the team by leadership, which is that everyone is expected to know what they’re doing or what they’re supposed to be doing. During our surveys of the employees, we encountered someone who claimed they did not know what the proper procedure for a certain task. We believe this could be remedied by a combination of the solutions provided in Section 5.3 as well as townhall style meetings between leadership and employees to ensure everyone is on the same page and knows what is expected of them. Overall, the study identified several weak areas within the ED. It can be reported that the ED has already begun the process of implementing some of these changes, and to very positive effect. The largest change so far has been the implementation of core groups or teams of nurses that work together within Pink Pod regularly. The increase in satisfaction among the nurses has been reported by leadership to have been improved, as well as the patient throughput—though statistics on these improvements are lacking at the time of writing. Other small improvements including additional sharps bins and a revised registration have also been rolled out, though the effects of these changes are also yet to be quantified.

Industrial Design Structure Method was successfully applied to the conception, and feasibility analysis of four mobility solutions for the near future. This case studies of a probable product conception were developed by the information gathered from knowledge of the design department, which allowed to oversee main product use and shapes. This information also was useful to gather the understanding that mobility solutions often require a physical plus a service product offering, and every detail can be solved on time from the first product requisites gathered at this point. The obtained models were subjected to physical and virtual validation through CAM technologies such as AM and visualization tools through rendering such as VRed and Keyshot. Through these tools, it turned out to be possible to have photorealistic three-dimensional images from the previously made 3D models, so as to provide a clear idea of the product, and to be able to make photo-insertions, so as to place it in a credible usage environment. Using Unity, it was possible to create an augmented reality environment in which to verify the use and proportions of the product.","solutions christian leon-cardenas, leonardo frizziero, giulio galiè department of industrial engineering alma mater studiorum university of bologna viale risorgimento, 2 – 40136, bologna, italy christian.leon2@unibo.it, leonardo.frizziero@unibo.it, giulio.galie2@unibo.it ahad ali and don reimer a. leon linton department of mechanical, robotics and industrial engineering lawrence technological university southfield, mi 48075, usa aali@ltu.edu, dreimer@ltu.edu","references in open

276,Enabling Digital Warehousing By An Additive  Manufacturing Ecosystem,"a digital twin or digital replica is a virtual model of a physical asset such as a product, process, system, or facility. it utilizes data from an actual physical asset to understand better and augment its performance, powered by artificial intelligence (a.i.), machine learning, and data analytics. digital twins can mirror a physical twin and reveal issues before they occur. they rely on sensors embedded in the physical world to transfer real-time data about the operative process and environment. the data collected from the connected sensors is then analyzed on the cloud and is accessible via a dashboard. digital twins are powerful masterminds to drive innovation and performance. unsynchronized production can easily cause problems such as the backlog of intermediate warehouses, unsmooth production, and long production cycles. synchronized production helps to improve overall efficiency and reduce waste. the material handling, production logistics path, movement pattern, suspension, and caching mode of the wip (work-in-process) need to be planned based on the equipment's action and behavior mode. unloading, distributing, and delivering raw materials to the manufacturing unit and warehouse are all part of material handling. the digital twin technology provides a highly efficient runtime environment for simulating complex systems and searching for robust computational optimization models. digital twin technology has a wide range of economic value depending on the monetization model. this study explored costly industrial or business equipment, services, or processes that can be optimized by reducing asset downtime and lowering overall maintenance costs. these capabilities are essential, making internal software competencies crucial to driving value.","industry 4.0, digital twin",,"arvin shadravan and hamid r. parsaei wm michael barnes '64 department of industrial & systems engineering texas a&m university college station, texas, usa arvinshadravan@tamu.edu, hamid.parsaei@tamu.edu",

279,Effects Of Sleep Quality On The Fatigue Level Of Students  During Covid-19 Pandemic,"since the coronavirus outbreak, the philippines has been one of the many countries in the world to close its colleges and institutions, putting students at risk of being isolated from their schools and communities. this study was able to help address the issues that contribute significantly to students' sleep quality by assessing the impact of the pandemic on their fatigue levels. based on the results of 216 students, the majority of respondents are mentally drained, have insufficient stamina for daily activities, and become sleepy very quickly. thus, it is critical to support and monitor the well-being of college students when they reach critical developmental milestones in an unstable social environment.","sleep quality, fatigue, students, 2020","Since implementing the enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) in the Philippines in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, schools and universities have shifted to online education to prevent the virus spread among students and teachers. Since the pandemic, universities, and schools are closed, contributing to the probability of students feeling that they are opting out of school or community isolation. Furthermore, through the shift in online learning, the difference between home-study life can be challenging to separate. Stressors such as excessive workload, anxiety, depressive disorders, and sleep deprivation presumably affect the students' physical, emotional, and mental health. Being in a situation of uncertainty, it is essential to prioritize health, especially among students. One of the most critical factors that affect one's health is sleep, as it is considered a basic necessity in one's life. Most students feel that studying excessively and finishing the workload of activities compared to having a good quality sleep can increase their academics. Yet, this type of habit can be dangerous to one's health. For further analysis, this study aims to evaluate the sleeping quality of college students during the COVID-19 pandemic by determining the effects of sleep quality on their fatigue level. This can be beneficial to students and universities to assess the factors that contribute to a student's fatigue level. Results in this study were gathered from college students using a survey questionnaire aiming to determine. Through the collected data, the assessment of students' fatigue is feeling exhausted throughout the day. This can be correlated to students' sleep quality since sleep deprivation makes students feel drowsy and tired during the day (Henna, 2018). To understand the factors that disturbs students' sleep quality, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was utilized. Hence, by assessing these factors, it was determined that difficulty in sleeping attained the highest rate, followed by lack of enthusiasm. Night routines such as using gadgets before sleeping and academic performance can be causes that can affect these situations. In closing, mental fatigue and physical fatigue have affected one another. Students experiencing either one of these fatigue levels causes them to experience the other. Their relationship with one another suggests that excessive workload from school or home and stressors regarding their mental health can be indicators of fatigue that students can experience within their bodies. 6. Recommendation This study provided an accurate and deep understanding of how mental and physical fatigue correlates to the sleep quality of college students. Results show that 92.6% of the respondents experience substantial fatigue, and all factors from the fatigue assessment scale are significant. Moreover, there is only a moderate correlation between sleep quality and physical fatigue, which proves that the students' only four (4) from the PSQI were significant and highly felt. Given these numbers, it is still advisable for students to achieve a good sleep quality as it is the primary source of vitality, motivation, and physical and mental well-being. In an unstable social situation, it is crucial to show support and monitor the well-being of college students as they achieve major developmental milestones, as sleep deprivation highly influences university students' academic success.

280,Effects Of Academic Workload On The Burnout Of Students  During Online Learning,"as a preventative measure against the spread of the coronavirus disease, most educational systems worldwide have shifted to remote learning (covid-19). however, the quick shift to online learning has produced some difficulties that have yet to be overcome. this paper aims to describe the effects of academic workload on student burnout during online classes. students in the philippines face difficulties with remote learning after the covid-19 crisis. the researchers used data from a sample of 204 respondents obtained from a digital survey containing their responses. the research aims to analyze and give an interpretation of the survey results with the use of pearson correlation analysis. the content analysis revealed the following categories of effects of academic workload on student burnout during online classes: work is hurried and rushed, workloads are challenging to manage during online classes, feeling discouraged, irritated, stressed, and annoyed, feeling burnout, and feeling fatigued. furthermore, regression analysis proved that students' academic burnout is significantly influenced by physical workload, reduced sense of performance, effort, and frustration. thus, education and counseling support are needed to reduce the student’s burnout during online learning.","academic workload, burnout, covid-19","The findings of this study can be used to look at how health, stress, and workload are associated and draw conclusions about what this means for undergraduate students doing online learning. This study's findings have significant consequences for mental health professionals. The study showed that burnout, a widespread problem among students, impacts numerous aspects of their lives, including their functionality, contentment, and outlook on the future, causing them to experience psychological issues such as despair. When a student seeks psychiatric help with complaints like disappointment due to high expectations, inactivity due to a lack of energy, frustration due to giving up personal expectations, lack of interest, and sensitivity, mental health professionals may be able to provide them with more efficient help if academic burnout is suspected.","ma. janice j. gumasing, christian jay e. sesnorio, henrie louis p. subido, charles kristian k. ilo school of industrial engineering and engineering management mapua university muralla st., intramuros, manila, philippines mjjgumasing@mapua.edu.ph, hlpsubido@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, cjesesnorio@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, ckkilo@mymail.mapua.edu.ph",
281,Effects Of Boredom On The Academic Engagement Of  Students During Online Class,"this research study focuses on determining the boredom and work engagement of the students in the online class setting. boredom is a prevalent emotion of becoming uninterested in any activity. it is a common emotion for everyone and significantly affects the work engagement of the students in an online class. the researchers gathered data from 200 students from different universities. student boredom was measured using the utrecht boredom scale, which contains eight items capturing boredom's affective, cognitive, and behavioral manifestations. on the other hand, work engagement is measured using a 3-item version of the utrecht work engagement scale, which contains items measuring vigor, dedication, and absorption. the association between boredom and variables of work engagement is analyzed using the pearson correlation test. results revealed that students who felt bored during online learning displayed a low level of vigor and absorption. in contrast, students who showed a high level of vigor said a higher level of absorption and dedication during online learning. the result opens an opportunity to make the learning system in online classes better because it is more susceptible to boredom that lessens the work engagement of the students.","boredom, work engagement, online class, dedication, vigor","Based on the findings, the students indeed feel bored during online classes. When the COVID-19 pandemic occurred, most students had difficulty transitioning to virtual learning. According to the result of this study, most of the students found their studies challenging during online learning, and while doing some school requirements, they observed that time seemed to pass very quickly. It was also found in the study that students who feel bored during class had displayed low level of vigor and absorption during online class. Thus, to avoid boredom during online learning, the researchers recommend the following. It is recommended that the institution initiate interaction by providing creative and helpful programs during online classes, such as making games as promising learning tools every once in a while, throughout Proceedings of the 7th North American International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management, Orlando, Florida, USA, June 12-14, 2022","ma. janice j. gumasing, jan aldrin v. dahilig, christine angelie y. taw, christlyn mae c. valeriano school of industrial engineering and engineering management mapua university muralla st., intramuros, manila, philippines mjjgumasing@mapua.edu.ph, janaldrindahilig@gmail.com, angelie0207@gmail.com, cmcvaleriano@gmail.com","References

285,A Non-Delay Algorithm For The Job-Shop Scheduling  Problem,"the previous research applied the artificial immune system algorithm in job shop scheduling with five jobs and three machines with a makespan result of 61.15 time-units. the algorithm is considered inaccurate because it requires complicated steps for operators to understand, such as determining random numbers of initialization and clones, donor seeds, and repetition of gene fragments to produce a smaller makespan. the proposed algorithm is derived from the non-delay algorithm with a modification in the form of ranking based on the criteria of the earliest start time, the earliest finish time, the longest remaining total processing time, and the total remaining operations. modifications are also made by giving the priority order of machines based on the most used machines in each operation. the results showed that the proposed algorithm could shorten makespan by 3.99% to 57.16 time-units with a reliability percentage of 55.55%. the proposed algorithm gave the same or better results in the first ten cases with two to six jobs. the small number of jobs and machines resulting in a small combination of scheduling sequences and cases that might be resolved optimally on the reference data. the proposed algorithm could not give a shorter makespan result in the eleventh to eighteenth cases with more than six jobs. the proposed algorithm only provided one scheduling sequence, with the advantage of being a few easy steps.","job shop scheduling, makespan, scheduling","1 Zhang et al.

The proposed algorithm can give the same or better results in the first ten cases out of 18 cases with a reliability percentage of 55.55%. The first ten cases have two to six jobs. In 11 to 18 cases, the proposed algorithm cannot give better or comparable results than makespan in the source case. Cases 11 to 18 have many jobs totaling seven to 10 jobs. In two jobs, the proposed algorithm gives the same results as the makespan data derived from the data source. It has occurred because the number of jobs is small. Therefore, the possibility of changing positions for scheduling between jobs is limited. Furthermore, in three jobs, the proposed algorithm gave better results in case fourth. In cases with four, five, and six jobs, the proposed algorithm can produce a better makespan than the makespan from the case data, except in the case by Fisher and Thompson (1963) with six jobs; the proposed algorithm produces the same makespan which is 55.00 time-units. A previous study by Thamilselvan and Balasubramanie (2011) used a genetic algorithm, while Kurdi (2015) used the Island Migration Algorithm, like the genetic algorithm using random numbers to determine scheduling sequences. The case of Prasetyo et al. (2015) also applied random numbers to scheduling work. Thus, the resulting schedule does not necessarily produce the best or the shortest makespan. If the number of jobs is more than seven, the proposed algorithm cannot give similar or better results. The more jobs that must be scheduled and the number of machines available, the more combinations can occur for scheduling. In this case, the proposed algorithm with criteria such as earliest start time, shortest completion time, longest remaining processing time, and the highest number of remaining operations gives a sequence that results in a makespan longer than makespan from the case data. Thus, for cases with a many number of jobs with vast combinations, the algorithm with random numbers can produce a shorter makespan. However, the algorithm with random numbers must go through a certain amount of work to get good results. It is different from the proposed algorithm, which only requires one work, although the results are not necessarily the best. 6. Conclusion From the conducted research, it could be concluded that the proposed algorithm can provide a shorter makespan compared to Astuti (2013) by 3,99%, from 61,15 time-units to 57,16-time units. Applying the proposed algorithm in eighteen cases with a different number of jobs has a reliability percentage of 55,55%. The proposed algorithm produces the same or shorter makespan for the first ten cases, with fewer jobs between two and six jobs.

288,"The Relationship Between Foreign Workers’ Perceived  Organizational Support, Cross-Cultural Adjustment, And","foreign workers make up a substantial portion of the labor force in developed countries and emerging markets' hospitality industries. hence, managing international employees has received the attention of scholars and multinational companies in this field. the goal of this study is to examine the association between the foreign workers' perceived organizational support (pos), cross-cultural adjustment, and job performance. this study used structural equation modeling to analyze sample data of ninety-nine hospitality workers from indonesia who were mainly living and working in melbourne and sydney, australia. the result of the study indicated that perceived organizational support positively influences cross-cultural adjustment. also, the cross-cultural adjustment has been found to positively influences workers' job performance. interestingly, this study found that there was an association between perceived organizational support and job performance. lastly, cross-cultural adjustment moderates the relationship between perceived organizational support and workers' job performance. this research is one of the first studies that examine the indonesian hospitality foreign workers’ perception of organizational support, cross-cultural adjustment, and job performance. our findings shed a new perspective on one antecedent of foreign workers’ job performance. our findings also serve to elucidate the roles of cross-cultural adjustment in a multicultural workplace.","job performance, orlando","This study aims to examine the relationship between Perceived Organizational Support (POS), cross-culture adjustment, and job performance among foreign workers in the hospitality industry in Australia. This study found a significant positive relationship between POS and cross-cultural adjustment, POS, and workers' job performance. A meta-analysis study examining the relationship between Perceived Organizational Support and job performance conducted by Riggle et al. (2009) found that there was a significant positive relationship between these variables. This finding was supported by Shen et al. (2014) who also found a significant positive relationship between perceived organizational support and expatriates’ job performance. However, the current study found that there was no significant relationship between foreign workers’ perception of organizational support and their job performance. This result was not expected. Many Indonesian hospitality workers in Australia experienced culture shock as a result of their work. The contrasts between their home and host countries usually cause tension and bewilderment. Miscommunication due to a language barrier may also cause frustration among these workers. Managers and local staff, for example, may utilize slang language that Indonesian workers do not understand. Furthermore, inequalities in cultural power distance (Hofstede, 2011; Khatri, 2009) may have an impact on Indonesian workers' cross-cultural adjustment. To put it another way, when the host country is more culturally distant, it is more difficult to adjust (Wang & Varma, 2019). This may result in a situation in which the hospitality company's support is viewed differently by Indonesian hospitality workers, negatively impacting their job performance. On the contrary, if these workers have a high level of cross-cultural adjustment, workplace cultural misunderstanding can be reduced. In other words, the cross-cultural adjustment will increase the poor link between Perceived Organizational Support and Job Performance, thus, this study supported hypothesis 4 (H4). The findings of this study have several implications. First, the research has contributed to the organizational and social exchange theories, as well as other fields. This study integrates the variables perceived organizational support, cross- cultural adjustment, and job performance in order to examine the social interchange between Indonesian hospitality foreign workers in Australia. Despite the importance of foreign workers in the hospitality business, past research on migrant worker POS, CCA, and job performance has been limited. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that examines these topics, especially in the context of Indonesian foreign workers in the hospitality industry. Second, the hospitality businesses that employ foreign workers should be more focused on cultural training at the work induction program. Also, hospitality managers should be aware that every employee who comes from many different cultural backgrounds may misinterpret the form of support due to cultural differences. Hence, it is crucial to conduct feedback sessions at the beginning of employment, either formally or informally. At the last, for the future research it is recommended that the findings of the current study be tested on other foreign workers from different countries. The comparison study also would be required to differentiate the result based on the nation's culture. Lastly, since this study relies on quantitative data, which lacks certain amounts of perceptive information, qualitative data would be significantly important to be explored.","performance in hospitality industry novita indah mulyaningrum hotel department, faculty of digital communication and hotel&tourism binus university jakarta, indonesia 11480 email: novita.mulyaningrum@binus.edu dendy rosman hotel department, faculty of digital communication and hotel&tourism binus university jakarta, indonesia 11480 email: dendy.rosman@binus.edu ichwan masnadi hotel department, faculty of digital communication and hotel&tourism binus university jakarta, indonesia 11480 email: ichwan.masnadi@binus.edu laurencia feriska hotel department, faculty of digital communication and hotel&tourism binus university jakarta, indonesia 11480 email: laurencia.feriska@binus.ac.id",

291,Analysis Of News Coverage On Covid-19 In Indonesia By  Australian Media,"at the time of writing this article, indonesian health system has collapsed due to the spread of covid-19. as a close neighbour to indonesia, australia is reflecting the importance of indonesia in its news coverage. how do australian newspapers report indonesia’s struggle in tackling the health crisis? this paper aims to answer that question by examining seven australian dailies, including two nationally distributed papers and five state-based media. the findings indicate that stories on covid-19 in indonesia are dominated by travel restriction, vaccines, and corruption scandals. in particular, the australian press tends to highlight the lack of strong leadership during the current pandemic. in addition, some minor topics emerged such as the release of an islamic cleric, natural disasters, and a plane crash. the framing of terrorism continues to display how the australian media is portraying indonesia as a hotbed for radicalisation.","australia, indonesia, news coverage, covid-19","There is no doubt that Indonesia is one of the most important neighbours for Australia, both in the security and economic aspects. However, the interest to report how Indonesia is dealing with the current pandemic is far from adequate. This study has demonstrated that in the last 12 months, articles on COVID-19 in Indonesia comprise only 177 collected from seven Australian newspapers. Echoing Tapsell’s (2021) assertion, the Australian press is far more inclined to report what is happening in the US or the UK, rather than its neighbouring countries. This study argues that the way the Australian press is framing COVID-19 in Indonesia is determined by its readers. For example, the West Australian newspaper tends to report on trade relations since their readers are dominated by farmers and those working in the agricultural sector. Hence, it is expected that the news coverage will be dominated by how the current pandemic and travel restriction will be resulting in significantly lower cattle exports. Meanwhile, other dailies tend to exaggerate terrorism and the potential security threats following the release of an Islamic cleric. Again, news coverage in Indonesia is associated with terrorism using harmful stereotypes. The framing of issues related to the Bali bombing continue to utilise an Orientalist approach (Mahony, 2010), reflecting Australia’s racist past and its fear of terrorism. Some caveats of this study include the type of media observed that only focus on printed newspapers. In a digital era, this might probably exclude a vast population who are now more relying on social media or other digital platforms for news feeds. However, the current paper remains important as it provides the first examination on how the Australian press are reporting Indonesia’s struggle in tackling the spread of COVID-19. Future research could expand this analysis by looking at different media platforms or to compare Indonesia with other Southeast Asian countries with similar levels of importance to Australia.

It started conducting a digital diplomacy offensive on Twitter that has become China's ‘channel of choice’ for digital diplomacy and was previously known not proactive in using Twitter. The involvement of the Chinese government in social media Twitter shows that digital diplomacy can make a real contribution to crisis management, both in the form of disseminating information to the public and in supporting communication between countries. The current pandemic has emphasized the importance of digital diplomacy skills in efforts to deal with crises, especially through Twitter which ultimately forces every state leader or representative to adapt to current development.

293,The Role Of Middle Power Country From Global-South In  Multilateral Climate Change Negotiation Conference:,"this article examines indonesia's role as a middle power in the katowice climate change conference or cop-24. to voice developing countries’ interest, indonesia has pursued three important negotiation points toward developed countries in order to achieve the goals of the paris agreement namely financial support, technology transfer, and capacity building. to overcome tension between developed and developing countries, indonesia has mobilized its middle power status particularly in the importance of developed countries to fulfil their commitments to developing countries. during the negotiation, indonesian negotiators seek to use the middle power position symbolically as a negotiating power and become representatives of other developing countries to reach a negotiating agreement at cop24. this can be seen in indonesia’s ability to create a narrative of symbolic power in the form of language, and identity, which is able to convince developed countries to agree with indonesia's demands. this article then contributes to the middle power literature by bringing the discussion of symbolic power into the discussion.","climate, change, multilateralism, symbolic","In conclusion, this article shows that Indonesia is trying to use the middle power as a symbolic tool to increase its interest in COP-24 in Katowice in 2018. By analyzing Indonesia's role in the Katowice conference shows that it has always reaffirmed the importance of developing countries. This repetition shows that Indonesia is trying to provide a social space that aims to create space for developed countries to support developing countries in fighting climate change. As a middle power, Indonesia symbolically represents the identity of a developing country. Indonesia through the delegation of Indonesia voiced three important issues that became problems for developing countries in implementing the Paris Agreement to combat climate change. From the results of negotiations between the Indonesian side through The Delegation of Indonesia at COP-24, several findings were produced. First, Indonesia uses the status of middle power to play its role as a negotiator, mediator and also to bridge dialogue in voicing the interests of developing countries in the issue of climate change. Second, all of Indonesia's three negotiating points during COP-24 were successfully voiced. However, not all points have the expected outcome. Financial support is easier for developed countries to fulfill, compared to technology transfer and capacity building. It is because technology support and capacity building must be adapted to the different of ""gaps"" and ""needs"" of each country. Thus, many developed countries are still considering and need time to review these two points compared to financial support. Moving forward, this article only focus on the COP-24 multilateral climate change conference held in Katowice in 2018. This will be a good avenue for further research on the role of middle powers at the next conference. Basically, every year the UNFCCC always holds a regular conference in one of its member countries. This article does not really look from the side of other countries, it only focuses on the role of Indonesia during the climate change negotiation process at COP-24. Hence, it would be better if someone explores the role of other middle power countries in the climate change conference so that they can produce a detailed and specific justification for the role of the middle powers.

294,Shared Challenges And Opportunities In Ending Child  Marriage In South Asia: The Case Of India And Bangladesh,"this research seeks to explain shared challenges and opportunities in ending the high rate of child marriage in two south asian countries, namely india and bangladesh. both countries are listed with the highest absolute numbers of child marriage in the world with 15.6 million and 4.4 million cases respectively recorded in 2019. by analyzing 20 papers published in the last 10 years, this study identifies a couple of similarities in factors that drive the prevalence of child marriage in india and bangladesh. studies pointing to the importance of government and non-government interventions as well as the efforts in improving education as strategies to combat the trend of underage marriage. the findings offer generalizability to the wider region and beyond. it is also important to note that some policy recommendations can be applicable to be implemented in countries with similar socioeconomic status.","child marriage, bangladesh, india",,"farah salsabila firdaus international relations department, bina nusantara university, jakarta, indonesia 11480 farah.firdaus@binus.ac.id ella syafputri prihatini, ph.d. international relations department, bina nusantara university, jakarta, indonesia 11480 ella.prihatini@binus.edu",
295,Clustering Different Learning Behavior With Model Of  Culture,"culturally based habits and expectations influence learning. identifying these cultural expectations is a prerequisite for designing learning environments that best serve students. this research studied the behavior of university students in the greater jakarta area using the model of culture. the model of culture was an extension from hall’s model, and consists of eight dimensions, i.e., time focus, time orientation, power, competition, action, space, communication, and structure. 1207 responses from different universities in the greater jakarta area were collected and analyzed using two-stage cluster analysis (combination of ward method and k-means clustering). the result shows three clusters, namely: the millennial engineers, the diffused social studies students, and the silent achiever. different teaching tools were then suggested for each cluster to address their weaknesses and strengths.","culture, education, learning, model of culture","Despite being the millennial generation, students have different cultures and preferences in the learning environment. The eight dimensions of the model of culture is a suitable tool to capture these differences. Three clusters of students identified in the study which gain insights into requirement and possibility for further improvement. As also mentioned by other previous scholars, the cultural assessment is not a static one, and can evolve over time. With that spirit, learning approaches and tools can be exercised in accordance with students' preferred style in order to form a better learning experience for the students. In general millennial students in the greater Jakarta area still require a teacher role as experts, despite more acceptance for a less hierarchical structure and diffuse environment. They are less future oriented, which need to be improved in order to prepare them for the business environment. The 1st cluster shows a good sign where engineering students show a more polychronic behavior which can help boost creativity and better result. The 2nd cluster, where most of the social science students are, need to improve in “future” orientation in their learning process. The 3rd cluster, which is most of the students, shows a promising trend in terms of awareness for achievement. The next task is to encourage creativity in the learning process to make it better. The study proposed a preferred learning strategy for each cluster as guidance. With the preferred and more suitable learning strategy, both lecturers and students can get an effective teaching-learning experience. Nevertheless, openness and exposure to different styles could also later be exercised to give them diverse and open learning experience. The study has limitations in form of sampling, as it only uses convenience and snowball sampling. A wider sampling coverage and/or a longitudinal study can enhance as future opportunity to capture a better dynamic of student requirement","elia oey international business & management program, management department, binus business school undergraduate program, bina nusantara university, jakarta, indonesia 11480. eliaoey@binus.ac.id jason lim civil engineering department, pradita university, tangerang, indonesia jason.lim@pradita.ac.id","references (Case study: Lampung

296,Colorism “Ideology”: The Legacy Of Colonial Mentality In  The Jakarta’S Gen-Z Mixed-Race,"colonialism left a big impact on power relations at the social level. one of the most prominent is the ideology of “colorism” which sees a person’s position and ranking based on racial features and skin color, thus created racial hierarchy. the problem is, this indication is still happening today, the lifetime of generation z (gen-z) who was born in the 21st century, when the world has become increasingly converged by globalization and easy access to information. the “ideology” of colorism still persists by placing the white race as a race that is considered superior and has higher privileges compared to the “indigenous” race. but we wanted to explore whether the same trend holds true for gen-z of white and “indigenous” descent. through the postcolonial approach, we conducted a survey of 152 respondents and semi-structured interviews of mixed race and “indigenous” people in jakarta and found that the colorism tendency only applies to those who are fully “white”, but not fully to mixed races. however, this mixed race still gets a lot of benefits from this racial condition, as well as often finds discrimination.","mixed-race, racial hierarchy, colorism, postcolonialism","Postcolonialism discusses the issue of power relations between people with white racial backgrounds who are often considered to have privileges in society. This issue then emerged as an “ideology” of colorism, which placed the privilege only on the basis of differences in skin color and racial features. This is supported by the embodiment of this mentality into social practices that preserve the racial and color-based social system of colonial heritage, even long after the practice of colonialism ended. In the case we studied, this tendency is still passed down to the generation born in the 2000s or 21s century, otherwise known as Gen-Z. By taking samples of Gen-Z aged 18-25 years from Jakarta, we conclude that this colorism tendency still persists until this research is made. Both the MR and NM groups realized that the superiority of the white race could be clearly iterated. But the same thing is not fully felt and experienced by MR. As a figure who is only half white, they are still often discriminated, although not to a destructive level, as is the discrimination between the Hutu and Tutsi races in Rwanda. In fact, often this discrimination does not occur in a negative sense, it even tends to benefit them in their social relations. However, we realize that this study is still too early to conclude more comprehensively on the tendency of colorism and colonial privilege inheritance, given the unrepresentative sample size and the limited survey area in Jakarta. Further studies need to be carried out to obtain a more accurate picture of this phenomenon in various regions in Indonesia.","dean shabira karunia department of international relations, faculty of humanities, bina nusantara university jl. kemanggisan ilir iii no.45, rt.12/rw.6, kemanggisan, kec. palmerah, kota jakarta barat, daerah khusus ibukota jakarta 11480 dean.karunia001@binus.ac.id aditya permana department of international relations, faculty of humanities, bina nusantara university jl. kemanggisan ilir iii no.45, rt.12/rw.6, kemanggisan, kec. palmerah, kota jakarta barat, daerah khusus ibukota jakarta 11480 adityapermana84@binus.ac.id","references are changing while maintaining segregation.

298,Gender And Covid-19 Vaccines In The Media: Evidence  From Indonesia,"this article continues to expand the examination on women’s representation in the media during the covid-19 pandemic by bringing the perspective of indonesia, the world’s fourth most populous country. with women greatly impacted by the pandemic from health, economic, and social standpoints, are they getting enough and equal representation in the media? drawing on a unique dataset from 197 news articles related to covid-19 vaccines in indonesia, the current study finds that there are a sufficient number of female authors but only 25% of sources being quoted were women. subsequently, only one out of nine categories has more female than male sources. it raises concerns on how women's voices could be heard in a country where women make up for 50% of the population yet continue to be underrepresented in media coverage.","women, covid, media, vaccines","This paper has demonstrated that women are still poorly represented in COVID-19 vaccines stories in the Indonesian media. There are two key takeaways from the current study. Firstly, there are more female journalists covering this topic, yet male sources are overrepresented when it comes to news quotations. From a total of 197 news articles published by 26 media, more than half of journalists/authors are female. Secondly, news sources are massively attributed to men. From a total of 9 categories, only one category has more women being cited. Indonesian experience offers generalisability in terms of the condition in Southeast Asia and beyond. With the largest population in the region and the fourth in the world, women’s underrepresentation in Indonesian media will continue to shape how women’s fare in news coverage, especially during the current pandemic. The current study lends support to previous observations which suggest that women tend to be invisible in media reports regardless of countries’ socio and economic status.It supports previous studies that assert how women are barely visible in the media (Global Media Monitoring Project, 2020; Jones, 2020; Kossova, 2020; Smith, 2020). Improving women’s representation in the media is inseparable with the improvement of their substantive representation. Positions that currently are unfriendly toward women such as local/national leaders or ministers should admit more females. One of the approaches is through quota implementation. Furthermore, existing studies have suggested that gender stereotypes that exist in society limit women’s coverage to mostly feminine related topics (Van der Pas and Aaldering, 2020; Widiati, 2021). To tackle this, society must be educated that women’s roles are beyond being in the kitchen or as moms, but they can also be powerful leaders. There are two main caveats of this paper. First, as this paper collected its samples from Google News, hence it did not display the entire articles published during the period of the study. In this respect, some media may not appear in the search result as well. Therefore, future research might be interested in expanding the sampling method to other platforms beyond digital media and the period of observation. Doing it would allow more articles and media to be collected as data samples. Second, future study may also be interested in interviewing journalists to provide a qualitative perspective as to why authors choose to cover men or women sources in their articles. This could fill in the white spaces of this study that mainly focuses on a quantitative viewpoint in understanding gender bias in the media. Despite the mentioned limitations, one of the biggest contributions of this study is its attempt to fill in the white spaces in existing research. The current paper provides empirical evidence on how poorly women are represented in the media in a developing country, specifically in Southeast Asia.

301,Learning Korean Using Online Platforms Following The  Success Of “Squid Game” And During Pandemic Times,"the consumption of korean popular culture in indonesia has always been increased since the early 2000s. in september 2021, the entire world was shocked by the south korean entertainment industry with the appearance of the ""squid game"" netflix mini series. south korean language and culture is currently being globalized with the korean wave, a term given when korean pop culture has spread worldwide in various countries since the 1990s, such as films and music. the success of south korean in exporting its culture can be immediately detected by the hike of interests in learning korean. this study is particularly interested in examining the growing interest in learning korean using online platforms, following a massive hit of the ""squid game"" in indonesia. it also seeks to understand indonesian young people's perceptions towards the korean language.","e-learning, ""squid game"", korean language","Our study has shown that after watching the “Squid Game” series and the current pandemic, most respondents continue to learn foreign languages, especially Korean. In fact, the limitation of face-to-face learning could actually encourage learners to use online platforms because this approach offers flexibility and can be accessed at any time. This paper reveals the interests of our respondents in learning Korean through online platforms after watching the “Squid Game” Netflix mini series and during the pandemic using online surveys and interviews. The findings show that most of the respondents in this study are very interested in learning Korean after watching the “Squid Game” series and their main motivation is because they are very interested in Korean cultural products such as K- pop, Korean films, and TV programs and also they want to broaden their insight about Korea. This paper contributes to the literature on Korean foreign languages and the use of online platforms to study Korean. Some caveats from this study include the number of respondents and the duration of the observation. While the interest in learning Korean can be triggered by the “Squid Game”, more study is needed to examine whether this is sustainable in a longer run. It is also interesting to test whether the new skill will provide a better job opportunity for young Indonesians.

302,Process Performance Improvement For An Elevator  Construction Company,"the success of an organization is measured by accomplished project deliverables and growth in market competition. however, hindrances can be an impediment in project successes. these hindrances are mostly attributed to project delays. this study aims to outline project delays in construction projects, particularly in elevator constructions. furthermore, the paper addresses the issue of these delays and proposes a process performance improvement through the identification and mitigation of delays in elevator construction – by presentation of project research criteria and identification of appropriate project management tools and techniques. to achieve this goal, a multi-mode descriptive study is adapted by using quantitative and qualitative approaches by means of interviews, root-cause analysis, decision analyses, and potential problem analysis. based on the analyses conducted, risk assessment, supply chain forecasting, critical path method (cpm), program evaluation and review technique (pert), make to stock (mts), and schedule compression are necessary to avoid the three most significant delays: lack of project management tools, poor risk management plan, and delay in delivery of materials by supplier, respectively.","project management, decision analysis, delay factors, weighted scoring","Proactive approach for process improvement is utilized for the prevention of issues that may occur before the project begins - through the application of Decision Analyses in the identification of delay factors and implementation of controls on project management. To avoid having delays, the company must focus on the duration of project activities and control the crucial risks that may occur during project development. The study recommends that there is a need to improve in project planning in the current processes of the company; and adaptation and investing in project management tools and software is necessary. Furthermore, the application of weighted scoring in project development can contribute greatly for the prioritization of actions - by means of ranking delays in order to gain adequate insight on risk assessment for project completion. Finally, the study implores that the benefits of integration of PM software outweighs the costs of such tools.","edi lynne l. cruz school of industrial engineering and engineering management mapua university manila, philippines edilynnecruz@gmail.com grace lorraine intal school of information technology school of industrial engineering and engineering management mapua university manila, philippines gldintal@mapua.edu.ph",

305,Factors Analysis For Customer Behavior   On The E-Commerce Platform In Thailand,"to investigate customer behavior on an e-commerce platform in thailand that was expanding in response to the increasing value of a market in which more people purchase online. furthermore, e-commerce is an advertising medium since it instantly connects information or user needs to target customers while also responding to market demands by reducing the time it takes to bring products to market, allowing for rapid market expansion. the study aims to study consumer behavior in online shopping through an application or platform and analyze the critical aspects of online shopping of customer behavior in e-commerce. data were collected and processed using exploratory factor analysis (efa) techniques, and a sample of 400 general people was chosen for survey research using questionnaires. the study's findings were as follows: reliability testing; kmo and bartlett's tests; total variance explained; scree plot; rotated component matrix. the result of the efa analysis came down to two components from 21 variables. as a result, they have been extremely positive and have garnered the most attention.","customer behavior, e-commerce, text, audio","For this study, most consumers choose to shop online because it is more convenient and they can buy goods and services anywhere, anytime. Most of them choose to use Shopee because of the diversity of the products, which was counted as 53.7 percent from 400 responses and the major thing that most of them consider purchasing is the price which is 66.6 percent. We chose to study consumers in Thailand that use the Shopee application through a questionnaire form and using exploratory factor analysis (EFA) tools to analyze the data and results using the SPSS program. The results analysis showed from 21 questions that Cronbach's Alpha is an excellent level of reliability. To determine sampling adequacy, the KMO test is employed. With said results, we can see that consumers use online shopping because of the convenience and the diversity of goods or services on the application by concentrating on the price. Most customers in Thailand are concerned about the price of the product, they will choose the product from an application that has the lowest price. When they had experience with that application, they will have a perception about that application is the cheapest. The customer has the perception that the Shopee application sells the product lower than another application, the customer will re-purchase the product from the Shopee application again. The seller of the application owner should concern with the price of the product. If the seller can sell the product at a lower price, then customers will come back and re-purchase. The application also has a chance to sell another product.","charukit chaiwan and sunida tiwong business excellence and logistics research centre: be-logist, school of management, mae fah luang university, chiang rai, thailand charukit.cha@mfu.ac.th, sunida.tiw@mfu.ac.th janista theja schenker and thanyalak ramkrathok logistics and supply chain management, school of management, mae fah luang university, chiang rai, thailand schenker.theja@gmail.com, thanyalakrktpp12@gmail.com",

However, it should try to increase the price if possible, and if not then increasing the demand will also increase their net profit. The risk associated with loss in this is only 22% which is moderate, but this is a decision for the managers to make. One way to improve and carry on this work is to conduct the same analysis for the full range of products (portfolio of products). The analyses conducted throughout this work has been very insightful to the directors at the food service operation company. Their decision before to order was not informed by data and powerful statistical insights, therefore in the past they have been barely profitable. Such analysis is expected to enhance their profitability in the near future. Alternative way is recommending to the company to change the way they do business by utilizing sea freight shipping for bigger quantities instead of air freight.

A large data collection sheet was created to collect all the measured data for 80 medical devices to assess the current state of the repair process. Results from FMEA indicated that the process of finishing paperwork for functional devices has the highest RPN. The implemented solution was transforming conventional methods related to the paperwork of all sub-processes in the repair center into a web-based system. Furthermore, the follow-up processes transformed into electronic-based methods. Consequently, the step of finishing paperwork, which has the largest influence on delaying the entire repair process was eliminated. This work showed the power of integrating the PDCA cycle with LSS throughout the control phase ensuring continuous improvement.","heba elhaddad assistant professor, department of industrial engineering alexandria higher institute of engineering and technology (aiet) alexandria, egypt heba.elhaddad@aiet.edu mohamed s. saleh military technical college, egyptian armed forces, cairo, egypt mohsal731@gmail.com lina el-sherif ismail assistant professor, department of industrial and management engineering arab academy for science technology & maritime transport (aastmt) alexandria, egypt lina.elsherif@gmail.com ayman a. nassar medical services administration egyptian armed forces, cairo, egypt ayman_nassar@knights.ucf.edu ahmed a mohamed director, solutions engineering healthcare system aamohamed@knights.ucf.edu",

312,"The Impact Of Indonesia’S Government Tin Policies Sn  99,9% Towards The Global Market","this research aims to see how government policies regarding the standardization of tin with sn 99.9% content affect the condition of indonesian tin and its impact on the global tin market. this research uses the concept of a global production network. this research focuses on strategy and dynamics in the tin industry. this research uses secondary data obtained from news, reports, and previous research that discusses the indonesian tin industry and primary data obtained through interviews with relevant parties that influence policy formation, then analyzed using the explanatory method. this research shows that the policy of sn 99.9% content in tin affects the condition of indonesian tin. the main reason for establishing this policy is to protect the availability of tin raw materials. the price of tin with a sn 99.9% higher content makes for superior profits. the impact of standardization of tin content tends to be positive because indonesia can directly sell tin without reprocessing it. on the other hand, the entry of tin products with a content of sn 99.9% into the global tin market has increased the availability of tin supply. this condition certainly makes customers no longer dependent on one supplier. customers in the global market can also buy directly from indonesia. however, in some situations, other factors affect the state of the tin market.",tin supply chain,"Indonesia's position as one of the largest tin-producing countries globally certainly has an essential role in the world's tin supply chain. This is illustrated by the government's attention to the tin industry since 1967. To protect the availability of tin resources in Indonesia, the government has set a policy to standardize the Sn 99.9% content in the tin as an export requirement. This policy can be said to be the central policy on tin export permits and affects the condition of the Indonesian tin industry. As one of the largest producers and significant suppliers of tin globally, this condition then affects the global tin market. This can be seen from the decline in the price of refined tin after Indonesia officially implemented a standard policy of Sn 99.9% content. The increased supply of refined tin due to supply from Indonesia makes prices tend to fall because the number of customers also does not increase.

321,Unlocking The Full Potential Of Augmented Reality For  Decision Making Under Battlefield Stress,"augmented reality on the battlefield has the potential to revolutionize tactical decision making, especially in support of a multi-domain operation (mdo). previous work comparing more traditional tools such as sand tables and tablets to the newer mixed-reality options do not show clear superiority of the newer technology. however, consideration of the surrounding literature suggests that there may be inherent advantages, and design interventions, that ultimately improve the utility of augmented reality tools such that they are preferable to previous technologies. specifically, in high-risk activities, such as those encountered in an active battlefield, the augmented reality interface, and the information available through that technology, may be designed so as to convey communication advantages. the proposed study compares design interventions for augmented reality using a hololens 2 to get information quickly for tactical decision-making across any mdo with similar representation on a tablet. using the situation awareness framework and cognitive workload measures (based on nasa-tlx), we look at training on augmented reality technology to determine the best options. furthermore, by studying the presentation of augmented reality images on the hololens 2, we would provide recommendations for how to quickly integrate the technology as a training tool and, eventually, a tool in the field. by determining the best ways to provide training on the new technology, the use of augmented reality can prevent costly and/or dangerous mistakes that would jeopardize the safety of the warfighter and increase the utility of the augmented system in scenarios where maintaining situation awareness is vital.","(mdo), hololens",,"betsy guzmán department of industrial engineering and management systems university of central florida orlando, florida, usa betsy.laxton@ucf.edu",
322,Development Of Material Requirement Planning System For  Snack Manufacturing Company.,"working in tandem with a leading snack manufacturing company, this project addresses the manufacturer's request of developing an mrp system that is flexible and can be easily integrated into the systems used in the company. a solution to develop an mrp system using excel was agreed upon as the software is familiar to both the administration and the plant managers and is a part of the established workflow. the basics of an mrp system are the three inputs those being: bill of materials, demand forecast, and inventory status files. producing the desired outputs of a production plan and a raw material ordering schedule. using excel as a repository for demand and inventory data and taking into factor the material ratios, calculations are done using excel and produce both a dynamic purchase report and production schedule. additional supporting data are also present in the form of pivot tables that show how much raw material can be rationed and distributed among products that have common components to further reduce the chances of stockouts.","mrp, excel, system","In Brief, the research goals were achieved, and a strategy is proposed as to how an MRP system for snack manufacturing companies can be designed without the sluggishness that is often associated with excel programming. Excel as the current version of the system produces accurate supporting information and gives insight into many of the aspects of the material requirement planning and scheduling process. The relationships and formulas used proved to be easily adaptable and can be tweaked manually as needed. Migration of data from other systems into the inputs is as easy as copying and pasting without having to adjust parameters. In addition, the system is light and portable not requiring significant processing power. The current results tested proved fruitful and additional improvements are a possibility.

331,Sustainable Performance: Understanding The Concept Of  Consumer Trust To E-Commerce,"studies related to consumer behavior in online shopping continue to increase, especially during the covid-19 pandemic. online shopping is related to e-commerce, and it takes trust from consumers to provide a stimulus to consumer buying behavior. examining the phenomenon of the problem, this study focuses on examining the support of consumer trust in e-commerce to increase consumer buying interest. the research was conducted by surveying consumers who have experience with e-commerce. there were 200 consumers whose data were taken through quantitative questionnaires, and the research results were processed to determine the correlation between variables. at the beginning, the validity and reliability of the research instruments were tested, followed by the research hypothesis testing, and ended with research analysis. the research findings are conveyed that consumer trust in e- commerce platforms is very important because it can increase consumer buying interest in products or services. there are several measurements that are considered in assessing consumer trust in e-commerce including overall trust, competence, integrity, and benevolence. there are recommendations for further research to examine other factors that can explain changes in consumer behavior in online shopping. especially recommendations for companies that have e-commerce are advised to evaluate consumer trust, so that they know consumer buying behavior","consumer trust, e-commerce, 2020)","The study of consumer trust is interesting to note in the field of management science, because consumer trust contributes greatly to consumer decisions. There are many theories that explain the concept and measurement of consumer trust, but it is found specifically studying e-commerce that there are four things that can form consumer trust. The dimensions formed for consumer trust are overall trust, competence, integrity and benevolence. On the other hand, consumer trusts are recognized as having an impact on consumer behavior, namely purchase intention. Through this research, it is hoped that the company will be able to measure consumer trust with the aim of increasing consumer buying interest. Companies certainly have a big share in solving consumer trust, because this study indirectly gives hope to companies towards sustainable performance. This research was studied in theory and found several assumptions with the model related to consumer trust, but it was not studied empirically to prove it to consumers. Based on these limitations, it is recommended that further research be carried out to confirm and refine current research that focuses on empirically examining the dimensions of consumer trust in relation to increased consumer buying interest in e-commerce","doni purnama alamsyah entrepreneurship department, binus business school undergraduate program bina nusantara university, indonesia doni.alam@binus.edu sandy setiawan entrepreneurship department, binus business school undergraduate program bina nusantara university, indonesia sandy.setiawan@binus.ac.id mira rustine entrepreneurship department, binus business school undergraduate program bina nusantara university, indonesia mira.rustine@binus.ac.id",
332,Developing Foot Lock For Public Toilet Facilities,"the impact of the covid-19 pandemic is detrimental to the community; therefore, it is necessary to take actions that can minimize the spread of covid-19 so that business sustainability can be maintained. one way to minimize the spread of covid-19 is to reduce physical contact using hands. however, based on observations, it is known that there are no available tools in indonesia that are used to avoid hand contact with the toilet door lock. this of course can be a means of spreading the covid-19 virus. therefore, in this study, a foot-operated toilet door lock was designed and made so that it is expected to reduce the spread of the covid-19 virus. foot lock product design was carried out using the quality function deployment method. customers’ needs were identified by using interviews and questionnaires. quantitative measurements were conducted to identify priorities, which consist of respondent satisfaction level, goals and sales points, improvement ratio, and row weight. the research continued with the development of technical responses (hows) to meet customers’ needs and then the house of quality was developed. alternative design concepts were developed using a morphological chart. the selected design was then made into a foot-operated door lock and tested for ease of use. the foot lock that has been made has an outer dimension of 308 x 126 x 121 mm.","foot lock, mining","This research has produced a foot lock, which was a foot-operated toilet door lock so that it can maintain the cleanliness of public toilet users and hopefully can reduce the spread of the Covid-19 virus.

335,Performance Measurement Model Of Environmentally  Friendly Service Quality To Customer Using System,"periodic evaluation of service quality by the company is a routine activity that aims to improve company performance. every decision taken by the company's leadership will affect the company's performance and organizational performance in general. for this reason, it is necessary to build a system dynamics model that is able to describe the current conditions that apply in the company and is able to do simulations to see conditions in the future. this study proves that the model built with a standard model for changing targets can simulate environmentally friendly service quality targets to customers with an overview of current achievements and forecasts of future achievements. future achievements are influenced by the control value of achieving service level agreement, reopened and response time, where the greater the control value, the greater the correction level value so that the gap will be smaller. the correction rates determined in this study were 10%, 20% and 30% of the gap size. proceedings of the 7th north american international conference on industrial engineering and operations management, orlando, florida, usa, june 12-14, 2022 © ieom society international 2764",,"From the results of this study, it proves that the model can describe the extent to which the target achievement is achieved within a certain period of time, while the conclusions from the results and discussion of this research are as follows: 1. Simulations carried out with several scenarios are expected to assist in decision making, by setting the correction rate of 10% of the GAP, the target achieved in 2025, when the correction rate is increased to 20%, the target will be achieved in 2022, and when the correction rate is increased to 20%, the target will be achieved in 2022. the correction rate is increased again by 10% to 30% the target is achieved in 2021. 2. Factors that affect the company's performance is the service quality factor that is not achieved in accordance with the target. The factors for not achieving service quality are due to not achieving SLA, Response Time and Reopened. The achievement of the minimum Response Time in 2019 was 83.75%, while the maximum achievement of Response Time and Reopened was 100%, there was no significant GAP for the achievement of Response Time and Reopened, but there was still a downward trend from the target that should have been achieved. The main cause of these factors is the absence of controls that are able to control the achievement of targets as expected by the company.","dynamics approach wahyu sardjono information systems management department, binus graduate program – master of information systems management, bina nusantara university indonesia 11480 wahyu.s@binus.ac.id haryoto kusnoputranto professor, department of environmental health, faculty of public health, university of indonesia, indonesia haryoto_k@yahoo.com johan school of information systems bina nusantara university indonesia 11480 johanj@binus.edu hargo utomo department of management, faculty of economics and business, universitas gadjah mada indonesia hargo_utomo@ugm.ac.id samudra sukardi post graduate program, study program of management science, faculty of economic and business, university of indonesia, indonesia samudra.sukardi01@ui.ac.id",
336,Case Study: Improving Employee Engagement And  Utilization Of The Service Engineering Workforce,"the traditional service engineering organizational model, developed through specialization, has led to repeatable, high-quality results, a highly focused workforce, and a dependable knowledge base. however, this model also limits career development, restricts employee engagement, and fails to optimize resource allocation to the changing business needs of the customer. by implementing principles of lean to break down silos across the organization, it is possible to transform an engineering organization, offer a wider knowledge base among resources, more effectively utilize the engineering staff to meet high- and low-volume workload demand, and increase employee engagement. employee engagement is important for the aforementioned reasons, but there is an additional element that should be a focus for strategic resource planning and implementation. a key benefit to increased employee engagement is the link to productivity. this paper will explore a case study for improving productivity and employee engagement congruently. the case study was successfully piloted in an aviation service engineering organization, and results over a one-year pilot project are shared. as a result, a tangible way to develop staff, elevate morale, improve productivity, and increase throughput of deliverables is possible.","employee engagement, leadership, lean, productivity","AND RECOMMENDATIONS 5.1 Conclusions Gallup has collected years of data that reveals a flat 30-34% employee engagement of workers. Companies are reported to spend millions of dollars to learn and improve this metric, without much historical success, presumed by the data collected from Gallup, Inc. Yet, if a careful look at the problem from the team level is taken, allowing the staff themselves to explore root cause and develop solutions to address the problem unique to their organization can not only yield improved employee engagement, it can benefit the bottom line and offer opportunity for business growth. In fact, Amy Adkins of Gallup says, “Employee engagement is a leading indicator of future business success, and Gallup has discovered close ties between engagement and outcomes such as turnover, profitability, and productivity” (Gallup 1). Inviting staff members to have an integral part in the effort toward improving employee engagement, and allowing them to define what it means within their organization to be engaged and how to improve it is a take away from this project analysis. Wide ranging benefits to the organization likely will result by following the steps of the method prescribed in this paper. The reader can take this developed method, study for applicability, and apply it across industries for improving employee engagement and optimizing utilization of the service engineering workforce. All three objectives of the project were met. Root cause analysis of the three problems identified with specialization within the service engineering organization was performed utilizing several lean tools used in recognized problem solving methodologies such as DMAIC. Solutions were tested by performing a pilot program, accomplishing the second objective. The final objective of the project, to develop a method that can be used for improving employee engagement and utilization of the service engineering workforce, was successfully documented, implemented into an aviation company with success, and proposed for wider use. 5.2 Recommendations and Future Studies In this case study, improving employee engagement was achieved, demonstrating that lean tools can be an effective way in contributing to finding root cause of organizational obstacles toward this goal, and that there can be productivity may increase through similar methods utilized. Another future study could include a deeper understanding of what criteria motivates even the engaged staff member to leave a company. Further study on key factors and levers, in this case, could be studied in understanding how the organization can increase the likelihood of retaining a high performing and engaged staff member.

E-service quality or electronic service quality is something that shows how e-commerce sites serve and facilitate online shopping, ordering to deliver a product or service effectively and efficiently (Santika and Pramudana 2018). Quality of service with customer satisfaction is a factor of a company's success to achieve competitive advantage with other companies. With good service quality, it can create customer satisfaction. Satisfaction is a person's feeling of pleasure or disappointment that comes from a comparison between his impression of the performance (or results) of a product and his expectations (Kotler and Keller 2016:153). Meanwhile, according to Maulida (2021) explained that e-customer satisfaction is When online products and services exceed consumer expectations, the level of buyer satisfaction after comparing the purchase experience and perceived expectations with the post-purchase experience online. So it can be concluded that e-customers satisfaction is the level of consumer satisfaction with a product or service online related to the fulfillment or not of consumer expectations or expectations. If the quality of service obtained by consumers can meet consumer expectations, consumers tend to feel satisfied and there is a lack of flexibility. Santika and Pramudana (2018), defines e-customer loyalty as a customer's favorable attitude towards online business that results in repeated buying behavior. It can be concluded that e-customer loyalty is the interest of consumers to repurchase a product or service online due to dissatisfaction after use.

345,Applying Lean Six Sigma To Enhance The Medical Devices  Repair Process In Public Healthcare Sector In Egypt,"due to the worldwide epidemiological crisis, the biomedical engineering sector, as part of the egyptian public health administration, has become under intense pressure to play a vital role in delivering appropriate healthcare services in the country and improving its performance. most medical equipment maintenance centers in the country have struggled to provide functional medical equipment in the public healthcare sector while keeping up with huge repair orders to meet the growing needs of medical devices to provide quality services at affordable cost. hence, there is a great need to deploy continuous improvement and waste elimination methodologies such as lean six sigma (lss) in the biomedical engineering sectors to promptly enhance the process capability to return repaired equipment to the field. this article aims to present a case study on the application of lean six sigma methodology at a medical devices repair center in egypt. a comprehensive analysis of the entire process has been carried out to reduce the lead time of the repair by improving the entire process. the results indicate that lean six sigma can be applied effectively to improve the availability of functional medical devices in public hospitals in egypt.","dmaic, healthcare, maintenance","This paper demonstrated how LSS was successfully utilized in Egypt's public health system to reduce the repair time of medical devices. LSS is a long-term method and despite being time-consuming, it guarantees a proper problem- solving approach for the maintenance process. A large data collection sheet was created to collect all the measured data for 80 medical devices to assess the current state of the repair process. Results from FMEA indicated that the process of finishing paperwork for functional devices has the highest RPN. The implemented solution was transforming conventional methods related to the paperwork of all sub-processes in the repair center into a web-based system. Furthermore, the follow-up processes transformed into electronic-based methods. Consequently, the step of finishing paperwork, which has the largest influence on delaying the entire repair process was eliminated.

346,"Parallel, Distributed And Federated Learning For Applying  Prim In Big Data","training models in machine learning often requires big computational capacities, even more when it involves big data. the patient rule induction method (prim), introduced as a bump hunting algorithm and a subgroup discovery method, already consumes a lot of computing resources when searching for the rules. in this computational research area, several methods have been developed to handle the problem of computing a big dataset: parallel learning, distributed learning and federated learning. in this paper, we investigate the literature review of these three methods to define each one and the differences between them, and then we determine which of these methods is best suited for the implementation of prim in big dataset for out futur works in big data.","parallel learning, federated learning, big data","In this paper, we give an overview of the three used techniques for computing a large-scale dataset in machine learning: parallel learning, distributed learning and federated learning. Each one of these techniques, is best suited in a case and addresses a different issue from the others. In the case of the Patient Rule Induction Method, we have three main components to use it for machine learning: choosing the search space, choosing the meta parameters and working with a high dimensional big dataset. In this case, and according to our review, we highlight that the application of PRIM on big data will depend on the domain. Indeed, if the experts already know which subset and meta parameters are the best for the rule search, the parallelization will concern only the data which will be split into different partitions. And then, to recover the overall model, one could consider it as an ensemble learning, or can consider all the boxes and then turn to pruning techniques. In the case of searching for the optimal meta-parameters’ combination, the parallelization will concern computing in each node a partition on a combination. Therefore, the complexity will increase because on each node there will be a partition and a list of meta-parameters’ combination possible. And the third case, concerns the search subspace. Again, the complexity increases and the time computing too, which lead us to stress the importance of the domain analysis for any size of data in machine learning. As for the Federated Learning, the use of it depends on the data policies concerning the privacy.

347,Blockchain Technology Evaluation With Linguistic  Variables: A Case For Smart Agriculture,"blockchain (bc) technology is developing in every sector, and it guarantees to solve many problems concerning security, privacy, and trust. bc is not a separate technology; it combines technologies in computer science and financial applications. when bc technology is assessed concerning agri-food processes, it is stated that it can be a quality solution to support transparency and help to build trust in the agri-food sector. concerning all the benefits and paradigm changes in the agri-food chain, understanding the bc technology is the first step before including it in the existing environments. knowing the key factors affecting the bc efficiency and application may be an excellent way to start and investigate the developing technology. accordingly, this paper aims to create an assessment methodology for the bc technology from the smart agriculture (sa) perspective. the 2-tuple linguistic (2-tl) model is used with multi-criteria decision-making (mcdm) tools. the 2-tl model is a linguistic-based analytical approach that can eliminate information loss during the translation stage. while evaluating emerging technology, a linguistic-based methodology could be more understandable for practitioners and researchers. the dematel method is utilized in this study’s framework thanks to its ability to check the interdependence among the proposed criteria and extract their interrelationships. evaluating these relationships can help companies increase the efficiency of their own evaluation processes. a case study to test the plausibility of the suggested framework is also given with detailed results and discussions.","blockchain, dematel, smart agriculture","This paper aims to create a linguistic information based MCDM model for BC technology evaluation for SA. As aforementioned, BC is seen as a ground-breaking technology for various sectors. Agriculture is one of the fields where the need for secure and traceable products is rising; therefore, this paper targeted the agriculture sector for BC technology integration. Since BC is an emerging technology, the impreciseness about the notion still exists for practitioners. So, this paper first targets to create an index for important dimensions and sub-criteria for BC technology. The same methodology also allows us to see the cause-and-effect relations between these dimensions; thus, this framework guides practitioners to precisely understand BC technology. Moreover, the same framework may also guide the policymakers or DMs in the organizations to select the most appropriate technology supplier according to their needs. In this paper, three different DMs are used during the case study. The number of DMs could be a limitation for this paper, yet according to the literature, the number is enough to reach an objective solution (Büyüközkan et al., 2021). Yet, for future studies, the number of DMs could be increased. Also, an appropriate technology supplier selection framework can be integrated with the existing one. The same 2-TL approach could be integrated into the supplier selection stage as well. Moreover, the same 2-TL-DEMATEL methodology could be applied to other smart technologies to understand better their purpose, enablers, and drivers.","gülçin büyüközkan professor, department of industrial engineering galatasaray university ortaköy, istanbul, turkey gbuyukozkan@gsu.edu.tr deniz uztürk department of management, business research center galatasaray university ortaköy, istanbul, turkey duzturk@gsu.edu.tr",

352,Implementation Of Lean Manufacturing To Increase The  Machine’S Availability Of A Metalworking Company,"the main objective of lean manufacturing tools is to eliminate waste from a process in order to make it more efficient. in this applied research with a quantitative approach, the production process of a steel coil cutting machine (slitter) of a peruvian metalworking company is analyzed. it can be said that the slitter is indispensable to supply semi-finished products to a steel tube production line. likewise, improvements are proposed and implemented based on three lean manufacturing tools in order to increase their availability, which hardly exceeds the value of 60%. one of the tools implemented was the single minute exchange of die (smed), which is aimed at reducing machine preparation times (setup) by reorganizing internal to external activities. another tool used was kaizen, which seeks continuous improvement and standardization of processes through simple and concrete actions. finally, the 5s method was applied to improve the cleanliness and order of the work areas. after these, the time available to produce increased 95.73 hours per month, which means an improvement of 17.36% in machine availability. also, setup times and operation cycle times were reduced by 16% and 16.35% respectively.","lean, manufacturing, availability, smed, kaizen","The increases of 17.36% in the availability and 10.37% in the productivity of the Slitter machine show that it is not necessary to make large investments in the latest technology to improve the competitiveness of companies. What really matters is to know the processes accurately and have detailed information about them. With this, problems can be identified and solved through the application of lean manufacturing tools. According to data from the Slitter machine, setup time represented 27% of the hours available for production; and unscheduled stops, 17%. From this, it was concluded that the activities involved in the setup needed to be reorganized and standardized. Likewise, it was concluded that it was also necessary to train operators in order to avoid unscheduled Proceedings of the 7th North American International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management, Orlando, Florida, USA, June 12-14, 2022","diego cabezas-fulca, ismael muelle-macchiavello industrial engineering study program universidad de lima lima, perú 20170228@aloe.ulima.edu.pe, 20182171@aloe.ulima.edu.pe edilberto avalos-ortecho industrial engineering school universidad de lima lima, perú eavalos@ulima.edu.pe","References
