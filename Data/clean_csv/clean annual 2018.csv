0,"Increasing Ambulance Capacity With A Lean Toc Approach  Bernardo Villarreal, Fernando González Aleu, Arturo Quezada, Gabriela Morales &","the measure of ambulance cycle time is of particular interest in the performance of emergency medical systems (ems). its value determines the ambulance capacity of the operations system of an ems institution. for a given number of ambulances in operation, as the value of the average ambulance cycle time increases, total ambulance capacity for the system is reduced. additional impacts resulting from this situation are; an increase on the average ambulance response time and patient´s health risk due to the unavailability of ambulances; and a greater need of ambulance replacement investment requirements and operating cost. this work suggests an improvement approach based on theory of constraints (toc) and elimination of waste for reducing ambulance cycle time. the approach is applied to a mexican ems institution based on metropolitan monterrey. results of the application are provided.","bottleneck, waste reduction",,"aracely carranza departamento de ingeniería universidad de monterrey san pedro garza garcia, n.l., mexico bernardo.villarreal@udem.edu, fernando.gonzalezaleu@udem.edu, arturo.quezada@udem.edu, gabriela.morales@udem.edu, aracely.carranza@udem.edu josé arturo garza - reyes derby business school the university of derby derby, de22 1gb, uk",
1,Waste Cooking Oil As An Energy Source,"almost all cities and towns in papua new guinea are producing tonnes of waste vegetable oils annually, mainly from industrial deep fryers in potato processing plants, snack food factories, fast food restaurants and institutional dinning facilities. these waste vegetable oils are directed to waterways, rivers and finally into the ocean which destroys the ocean shores and damaging the environment. with increasing population, not only the demand for cooking oil will increase but also the environmental problems caused by the waste cooking oil. most brands of cooking oil that is used in papua new guinea are from locally produced palm oil. palm oil consists mainly of triglycerides made up of a range of fatty acids and contains other minor constituents, such as free fatty acids and non-glyceride components. this composition determines the oil’s chemical and physical characteristics. this is an attempt to improve the waste vegetable oil’s chemical and physical characteristics that will allow the oil to be used as an energy source and at the same time reducing the associated environmental problems. it has been observed that the waste cooking oil can be converted into a useful energy source using the transesterification process. the converted fuel has been tested and found its performance to be equivalent to petroleum diesel.","vegetable oil, biofuel, biodiesel, renewable energy, triglycerides","A successful attempt has been made to make use of the waste cooking oil from the student’s dinning facilities as an energy source. The results are summarized as follows: 1. The waste cooking oil has been successfully converted as an energy source. 2. The biodiesel fuel produced from waste cooking oil is comparable with petroleum diesel. 3. Visual inspection of the exhaust gases indicates clean and environmentally friendly emissions being released from the exhaust system without any thick smoke.

2,Input Uncertainty Quantification On Supply Chain Simulation  Optimization Using Bayesian View,"accounting for uncertainties has been a profound feature for a robust simulation study. various attempts have been dedicated to incorporate such uncertainties by means of quantification, reduction, and risk mitigation and assess the effectiveness of such attempts in various types of queueing systems representing generic models with wide applications. in contrast, this study will focus on exploiting the potential uses of input uncertainty quantification in updating the credible confidence interval resulting from the bayesian approach on treating the input uncertainties. more specifically, this study deals with problems emerging in supply chain settings where the decisions are highly inter-related representing systems with complex interaction in its decision variables. the initial findings suggest that the traditional approach which relies either on a naive point estimate or even a conventional frequentist confidence interval that assumes perfect input modeling may lead to biased decisions, and hence yielding a sub-optimal result. furthermore, when the data available for input modeling is very limited, therefore constitutes high risks and dominant input uncertainties, the frequentist view will likely depart further from the optimality when one conducts a simulation optimization. thus, mechanisms accounting for input uncertainty using bayesian models should be favored as they account well for the associated risk inherited from input uncertainty.","input uncertainty, bayesian model",,"mansur maturidi arief industrial and operations engineering, university of michigan ann arbor, mi 48105, usa mansur@umich.edu",
3,A System Dynamic Approach Of Patient Satisfaction In India’S  Leading Healthcare,"healthcare systems face challenges including diminishing resources and increasing demands. the challenges need to be balanced in this complex system of systems to ensure a sustainable quality of life. sustainability considers the needs of future generations without compromising the needs of current generations. the social component of sustainability is one of the important areas in healthcare sustainability. the social component focuses on considerations such as equity, empowerment, accessibility, participation, cultural identity, and institutional stability. patient satisfaction is a key factor in the social element. patient satisfaction represents patient fulfillment in regards to the cost, accessibility to services and resources, and patient wellbeing. it is analogous to “customer satisfaction”. a systems thinking approach is applied to analyze the social aspect in healthcare systems. this paper explores important factors and factor relationships in healthcare social sustainability related to patient satisfaction using a system dynamics approach.","healthcare, systems thinking, system dynamics",,"1maria s. sebastin, school of business, amrita vishwa vidyapeetham, bengaluru, karnataka, india s_mariasabastin@blr.amrita.edu, ssebastin@mites.amrita.edu 2mridula sahay, amrita school of business, amrita vishwa vidyapeetham university, coimbatore, tamil nadu, india corresponding author - 2mridulasahay2001@hotmail.com, mridulasahay@gmail.com",

9,A Methodology For Measuring The Ecological Footprint Of  Freight Transport In Urban Areas: A Case Study Of A Moroccan,"the urban freight transport (uft) plays an important role in the quality of life in urban areas. previously, strategic decisions were taken with a view of economic and functional optimization; they now take the ""green"" turn, taking also into account the ecological impacts. therefore, the purpose of this article is to focus on the ecological weight of uft. we first delineate the challenges of green urban freight transport. secondly, we review the approaches to achieving an ecological balance of the urban freight transport. we develop the methodology used to measure the carbon footprint of the urban freight transport and energy consumption. and then, our case study concerns the flow of goods between all the economic establishments of the city of fez. the analysis of the results obtained makes it possible to draw a number of conclusions which we will present in the form of recommendations.",case study 3220,"In this article, we studied the situation of the urban freight transport of the city of Fez. We proposed a methodology for measuring the ecological footprint of the UFT. We tried, first of all, to delineate the challenges of green urban freight transport. Secondly, we presented the approaches using for measuring the ecological footprint of the UFT. Then, we presented our proposed methodology. For reasons of efficiency and neutrality and to collect the technical data related to our methodology, a mixed survey method was adopted. The technique we used is halfway between the qualitative analysis by semi-directive interview and the support of the quantitative analysis. It goes beyond a questionnaire survey since the goal is to meet the respondent. The questionnaire submitted to the persons interviewed comprises twenty questions. It consists of two parts, respectively, consisting of ten questions. One is the categories of vehicles, fuel consumption, tonnage, and so on. The second consists of questions concerning companies and their vehicle fleets. The questionnaire was completed directly by interviewees during a half-hour interview. Using this data we calculated the CO2 emissions and the energy consumption for different category of vehicle of the urban freight transport of the city of Fez. As a result, the fuel consumption for the year 2016 is around 26250 tep, for which the for-hire transport accounts for almost 62% of the total. Concerning the CO2 emissions, we can conclude that the UFT is a major emitter of GHGs, in particular the CO2 emissions. In the city of Fez, which is the subject of our case study, vehicles with a GVW between 3.5 and 8 t emit almost 14 kg of CO2. On the other hand, light-duty vehicles (LDV) issue 8 kg in the case of for-hire vehicles and 3 kg in the case of own-account vehicles. Thus semi-trailers heavy-duty vehicles (HDV) emit almost 18 kg of CO2.","city imane moufad laboratory of energy & sustainable development (lpe2d) sidi mohamed ben abdellah university - est, road of imouzzer - bp: 2427 - fez, morocco imane.moufad@gmail.com fouad jawab lpe2d & laboratory of international management decision techniques and logistics sidi mohamed ben abdellah university - est, road of imouzzer - bp: 2427 - fez, morocco jawabf@gmail.com",

11,A Demonstration Of The Difference Between Binomial And  Hypergeometric In Statistics,"this stem project is to use java random simulation to differentiate statistics between binomial (with replacement) and hypergeometric (without replacement). the author used the powerball lottery probability to determine the jackpot probability by matching the numbers of five balls and the mega number. the mega number of the red ball can be duplicated the same number of any white ball picked already. there is about 12% higher probability for jackpot if the mega number cannot duplicate the ball of any white ball picked. the author derived the java script to simulate two probability scenarios. binomial approximation of hypergeometric probability by adjusting the sample size in the pool was also studied. when the pool size is larger, the probability difference between whether the mega number can duplicate the white ball number becomes smaller. the ratio of two probabilities will approach 1 when the pool size becomes larger. java script can demonstrate this probability approximation pattern. this stem project is successful since the author can integrate learning across statistics, and java as a data science approach.","binomial, hypergeometric, java, powerball","This project used JAVA random simulation to define the difference between Binomial (with replacement) and Hypergeometric (without replacement).

12,Statistical Pi Simulation By Java  Katherine Lim,"pi, the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, is an important but irrational number in math. it is a frequently used number which can be used to find the circumference and area of a circle, as well as the surface area and volumes of spheres and cylinders. the purpose of this project to find pi with higher accuracy. a java monte carlo simulation method is developed to generate random points in the coordinate. by counting the number of points inside and outside the circle, we can calculate the pi. the sample size can be controlled in the java program. for each sample size, it was repeated for twenty times see how the relationship between accuracy and the sample size. in the end, the monte carlo method was revised to further improve the pi accuracy.",monte carlo method,"When the project was completed, all goals were achieved. Java was used to successfully simulate pi, it was concluded that the sample size impacted the result, determined that only needed 6 digits of pi, and the code was shortened even though the accuracy improved. For the future, another goal will be added, which is to measure the computation time for each of the codes, then compare them. The Sphere Method did not work as well as the other two Methods. After some investigating, the root cause of this was found. First, the Monte Carlo Method with the Upper Triangle Method were compared. The concentration of the dots was higher within the same sample size for the Upper Triangle Method. However, that wasn't the only reason. The further away the dots were from the circumference of the circle, the less accurate the value of the data was. The Upper Triangle Method took care of these outliers by limiting the location to the upper half. This concludes that the accuracy is also dependant on how the data is to the circumference. The results from the same sample sizes in the Monte Carlo Method and the Sphere Method were compared. The Monte Carlo Method did have the outliers, but the error was exponentially increased after using the Sphere Method. It is concluded from these observations that because the dot distribution in the Sphere Method is less concentrated than in the Monte Carlo Method, therefore results for Sphere Method are the least accurate. In the end, the first few digits of pi were consistently outputted. In the future, I plan to expand the range of numbers and increase the consistency of the accurate results by changing the variables that show correlation to accuracy.","eleanor murray fallon middle school 3601 kohnen way, dublin, ca 94568 katherinelim65@gmail.com",

18,Towards Assessment Of Innovation In Smes With Decision  Analysis Concepts,"we propose a commercialization model incorporating decision analysis where the value created by the owner/s of the sme is subjected for assessment from different angles. this assessment includes the feasibility study, which considers all the uncertainties surrounding sme sustainability. these uncertainties involve uncertainties at the development phase of the business idea. many smes in oman face uncertain demand for example and the feasibility study conducted at the early phase of the business does not do simulation or scenario analysis. we suggest the use of the decision analysis (da) science in engineering to help the smes study their market carefully and take calculated risk. the application of the field decision analysis fits very well and yet helps them make “good” decision. the current feasibility study for example used by riyada-public authority for sme development is static and never perform sensitivity analysis for the sme owner. according to the central bank of oman (cbo), one critical challenge faced by smes in oman include high costs of conducting professional feasibility studies which may be the case in other part of the world. in brief, we are going to develop a decision analysis assistive tool that is going to give a decision quality score at each stage of the innovation process.","innovation, sme sustainability","The architecture model of commercialization for innovative scientific research is very critical to help bridging the gap between the innovative scientific research and commercialization. The high uncertainty of innovative academic scientific research and the long-term involvement and commitments required for these research makes it very difficult to create a market value for them to attract investors. Creating industry and investors interest in the early stage of the innovative academic scientific research is challenging because of the uncertainty with the outcomes expected from them. Thus, proper assessment is needed and a commercialization model that takes into consideration different factors that should be imbedded in the national innovation system will help to bridge the financial gap for the commercialization of innovative academic scientific research. This paper provides a concept on how to assess innovation for SME sustainability using Decision Analysis tools and concepts. 6. Future Works and Research This is preliminary concept paper to illustrate how to utilize concepts of decision analysis into assessment of innovation to help SME sustainability. The next phase will be building the model that supports the hypothetical model developed by the authors.

Individuals may have different preferences than 
companies or universities. Many times technology development and funding decisions are made without 
any consideration of IP early in the process. This may result in an innovation with limited protect ability 
leading to limited opportunity for commercialization. This research will consider these factors very early 
in the process which will have impact the overall process. There is ample evidence of technology and 
innovation where IP was an afterthought. Consequently, the inventors and developers are unable to reap 
the full benefits of their innovations. This research will address these challenges and create a 
comprehensive analysis and decision-support tool. The tool that we propose to create will be illustrated in 
the next sections.   
 
 
3. Decision Analysis (DA) Model in Innovation 
The need for decision analysis is crucial in SME sustainability and it leads to apply the decision 
based design concepts.  “Decision-based design (DBD) is an approach to engineering design that 
recognizes the substantial role that decisions play in design and in other engineering activities, largely 
characterized by ambiguity, uncertainty, risk, and trade-offs. This research will combine two fields: 
Engineering Decision Analysis and Economical Assessments. The aggressive nature of competition in 
today’s markets makes innovation in SME a central point of contest. The benefit goes to the companies 
that are able to efficiently introduce products (price and performance) into the market. SMEs in Oman 
must guide their development effort toward three main objectives: low price, high quality, and long 
marketing window. The low cost Feasibility Study available in Oman are guiding them by applying a one 
single scenario profit i.e. profit is the margin between cost and selling price. The marginal profit must be 
sufficient in order to sustain SMEs and help them to grow. But we all know that high performance comes 
with high price and as a result a low demand. Having competitive edge in price and performance makes it 
a challenge for SMEs. While these objectives are often clashing or conflicting, they must be compromised 
using a normative approach by applying decision analysis.  Balancing these conflicting objectives using a 
normative approach helps to make SMEs efficient and business strategies effective.

19,A Comparison Of Ambulance Location Models  In Two Mexican Cases,"the development of several ambulance location models have been discussed in the academic literature. most of these models have been further extended to consider more realistic situations into account and the use of different assessment criteria. however, there is not an exhaustive literature that takes the existing standard models to compare them according to the criteria used in practice. in this work, we undertake the task of comparing the performance of several ambulance location models on coverage and response time criteria. the results of this work are important to help emergency medical organizations to define their most adequate model for defining their ambulance base structure. the comparison of the models is carried out on two mexican emergency operations of the red cross located in the cities of tijuana and monterrey.","ambulance location, response time, demand covering",,"edgar granda, bernardo villarreal, & gabriela morales universidad de monterrey san pedro garza garcía, n.l., méxico 66238 edgar.granda@udem.edu, bernardo.villarreal@udem.edu, gabriela.morales@udem.edu yazmin maldonado instituto tecnológico de tijuana tijuana, mexico yaz.maldonado@gmail.com",
20,A Goal Programming Model For Nurse Scheduling At,"the nurse scheduling problem is among the most widely studied problem in literature. nurse scheduling is concerned about allocating nurses to conduct specific tasks. the various objectives and constraints of this problem that changes from country to country and from hospital to hospital makes it very hard to solve. furthermore, lack of resources makes this scheduling task very challenging. many hospitals are still executing nurses scheduling manually, which is indeed a cumbersome and time consuming task. this, however, may lead to high chances and risks of not fulfilling all rules set by the hospital. therefore, this article presents a goal programming framework model to scheduling nurses working at the emergency department with the objective to increase fairness in shifts distribution. the experimental results highlights the importance of developing heuristic or meta-heuristic approaches to solve such np-hard problem.",goal programming,"AND FUTUREWORK This paper developed a mathematical model to solve the nurse scheduling problem. The mathematical model considered nurses working at an emergency department where there is three level of nurses’ skills. The objective of the model is to minimize the shortages of nurses in a given shift while minimizing the variation in workload distribution between them during the scheduling horizon. The constraints of the model were designed based on the regulations that are considered at the Emergency Department at Sultan Qaboos University Hospital. This problem is a well-known NP-hard problem. The developed mathematical model can be used to solve only small size problem. It is necessary to develop some intelligent method such as heuristic or meta-heurist to deal with medium to large size real problem. Therefore, in the near future, some intelligent methods will be developed and extensive numerical analysis will be conducted to compare them with mathematical model developed in this research.

21,Lean Manufacturing Adoption In The Transport And  Logistics Sector Of Thailand – An Exploratory Study,"this paper investigates the adoption status of lean manufacturing (lm) in the transport and logistics sector of thailand. a survey questionnaire was design, validated and distributed among thai transport and logistics companies. in total, 120 useable responses were received and analysed using descriptive statistics. the results of the study indicate that the implementation of lm is relatively high, with pdca, 5s and root cause analysis being the most implemented lm approaches and tools. however, the lm’s implementation was found to be mainly contained within individual departments or improvement projects, rather than being a company’s wide strategy. main challenges to lm implementation included: organisational structure of companies, misalignment between goals of individuals and their companies, and lack of sustainment of a lean culture. main benefits were the ability to identify and reduce waste, increased productivity and better organisation of workstations. on the other hand, lack of understanding, knowledge and expertise in lm were the main reasons for not implementing it, plus the use of technology-based tools instead of lm. non-lm companies showed interest in adopting lm in the future, with jit, kaizen and six sigma being the most likely to implement. this study is among the very first of its kind. it offers academics, researchers and practitioners interested in lm and/or the transport and logistics sector with some initial evidence of the adoption of lm in this industrial sector of thailand.","exploratory study, implementation, lean manufacturing, thailand",,"jose arturo garza-reyes centre for supply chain improvement university of derby derby, de22 1gb, uk j.reyes@derby.ac.uk sarita tangkeow warwick manufacturing group the university of warwick coventry, cv4 7al, uk sarita.tangkeow@gmail.com vikas kumar bristol business school university of the west of england bristol, bs16 1qy, uk vikas.kumar@uwe.ac.uk simon peter nadeem centre for supply chain improvement university of derby derby, de22 1gb, uk s.nadeem@derby.ac.uk","References

23,Analysis Heterogeneous Human Sensory Data From Product  Exterior Design Using Brsm,"facing fierce competition in the marketplace, companies should try to determine the optimal settings of new products design. human perception becomes the main objective in product development. this is related to consumer taste and preferences. in order to realize a well-designed product that appeals to costumers, the product not only should meet the physical requirements of consumers but also has to satisfy their affective needs. thus, in a diverse and highly competitive market, successful products may not those with desirable product form. this study proposes bayesian rough set model to deal some uncertainties and incomplete data in classification data. bayesian rough set method has the strength to solve vagueness in human sensory data with the probabilistic approximation to identify the relation rules between human perception and product exterior design. this is also useful to handle heterogeneous population, contradictive between generalization versus customization, and uncertainty – inconsistency in market segmentation. at the final result, the proposed method get the better result than conventional method (rough set) as followed: the proposed method get accuracy improvement rather than conventional method (rough set), i.e. 12.07%, and confidence level as big as 10.61%.",human sensory data,"5.1 Discussion The results from table 5 and 6 may suggest that the consumers purchasing decision with strong pattern, i.e. high rules strength, are most likely related to the prize and the product packaging itself. Although, the prize of the products is the highest factor which reflection of consumer desire, yet product packaging or product exterior design also should be considered as supporting primary factor as consumers want. The characteristic of product packaging such as bright colors and large sizes is more preferable to consumers – even there are many combination of conditional attribute that becoming consumers purchasing factor. In the proposed method to extract uncertain probabilistic, decision rule should be determined two aspects i.e. certain decision rules and evaluation factor rules. Those factors are bounded with parameters of probabilistic of the rough set theory, which is shown in Equation 8 and 9. Such probabilities are experientially acceptable in human evaluation data. If the larger the conditional probability is, the larger the information gain is too. Which means The definition of information gain by 1 corresponds with our intuition that the large increment of P(Dj|Ei) being more than P(Dj) should take larger information gain when P(Dj) is low, while the same increment of P(Dj|Ei) should take smaller information gain when P(Dj) is high. Since the information gain enables to evaluate the influence of the set of conditional attributes on decision class relative to its prior probability. We conducted comparison parameters of probabilistic for variety of clustered consumer desires. It should be noted that β ≤ 1−P(Dj). In other words, β should be less than the residual of the prior probability P(Dj). if it is taken  = 0, POSβ(Dj), NEGβ(Dj) and BNDβ(Dj) are characterized by P(Dj|Ei) ≥ P(Dj), P(Dj|Ei) ≤ P(Dj), and P(Dj|Ei)= P(Dj) , respectively. As the value of β increases up to min (1−P(Dj),P(Dj)), the positive and negative regions decrease, and boundary region increases. Furthermore, as the value of β increases, the information associated with Dj is strongly relevant to Ei. Figure 2.

32,Assessing The Impact Of Input Model Misspecification On  Integrated Supply Chain Decisions,"in simulation optimization, the validity of the optimal solution relies profoundly on the accuracy of the input model that is used to drive the uncertainty in the simulation model. however, determining the exact input model that perfectly mimics the underlying input processes that generate the true uncertainty in the real system is impracticable, because of the frequently limited available data. in practices, hypothesis testing imbued in the goodness-of-fit (gof) test and validity test is often used to justify whether a certain input model is ‘close enough’ to represent the true input processes. the results of these tests, however, are likely that we fail to reject several input models, which then raise the likelihood of misspecifying the input model. we examine the optimality of the solutions obtained by relying on misspecified input models in optimizing integrated supply chain decisions, i.e. when operational, tactical, and strategic decisions are simultaneously optimized in terms of service level and operating cost. the results suggest that in such integrated setting, while the optimal scenarios obtained from each input model may likely vary, the corresponding objective function values do not significantly differ, especially when we account for the trade-off between service level and cost. furthermore, our result also shows that the input uncertainty inherited by a certain input model does affect the interactions among various decision levels. hence, the importance of obtaining a sufficiently accurate input model becomes more crucial in optimizing an integrated supply chain system via simulation optimization.","simulation modeling, input uncertainty",,"mansur maturidi arief industrial and operations engineering university of michigan, ann arbor mi, usa mansur@umich.edu",

Contrasting the self-assessment tool used in this investigation vs. the currently available, there are only four changes observed in the self-assessment tool items (see Table 5). The self-assessment tool “Are we making progress?” was useful to identify opportunities for improvement. In this investigation (single case study), hospital frontline responses identified hospital strategy as an opportunity for improvement as well as the lack of communication about the financial status of the hospital. On the other hand, the exploratory factor analysis suggested that items used in “Are we making progress?” are not well grouped in the initial set of seven categories.

During the course of the study, excessive movements of customers from one work station to another work station (i.e. excessive transport), high waiting time, and underutilization of Meeter Greeter and Photo Booth work stations were the current wastes and bottlenecks present in South African Service Center ABC. In addition to this, the bottlenecked work stations in South African Service Center ABC are the Payment and FLO service stations. Based on these results, the merging of the Information Line Center and the Meeter Greeter stations as well as the merging of the Payment and FLO stations; with an increase number of servicing staffs were proposed by the authors as suitable strategies capable of optimizing customer service delivery in South African Service Center ABC. Furthermore, 5S was also implemented in Service Center ABC in order to ensure the use of good housekeeping practices in this system.

39,Optimizing Protection Decision In Railway Systems  Girish Ch. Dey And Mamata Jenamani,"events during last two decades have shown that railways have become the primary interest of terrorist activities. but, planning for protection against these threats on railways is challenging because of their geographical extensiveness, open and easily accessible infrastructures. hence, identification and protection of only the critical components of railway infrastructures are very essential. in this paper, we present an optimization model to allocate the protective resources among the components of the railway systems optimally to minimize the impact of worst-case disruptions. the main focus is to enhance the applicability of the model by capturing additional realism and complexities of railway systems. we formulate the problem as a tri-level mixed-integer program. then, we simplify it a bi-level problem and solve it by super valid inequalities based decomposition algorithm. computational results of a case study on south east coast indian railways are analyzed for efficient protection decisions.","fortification, interdiction",,"department of industrial & systems engineering, indian institute of technology kharagpur, west bengal, 721302, india deygirish@gmail.com , mj@iem.iitkgp.ernet.in",
40,Improving Teamwork Quality To Succeed Software  Development Project Using Ahp (Case Study),"abstract— it project management is a combination of traditional project management concepts with a working cycle of information technology systems. the success of an it project requires strong cooperation and communication between members of the project team. variables that can affect teamwork quality (twq) should be applied to obtain effective teamwork. the variables are communication, coordination, equal contribution of members, mutual support, effort, and team cohesion. teamwork quality dimensions will be used as a reference for making questionnaires that will be distributed to respondents. in this study, the questionnaires were distributed to two software development companies. the questionnaires are processed by applying analytical hierarchy process (ahp) method. the finding is mutual support has the biggest eigen factor that influence teamwork quality. mutual support means an ability and willingness of team members to assist each other in carrying out their duties. having the same goals and good team bonding and relationship.","teamwork, budget","Company X and Y is a software developer who use Agile as a method. Several studies confirm that team may arise when adopting Agile. Many researchers suggest framework, critical success factor to create better TWQ in project especially in software development project. However, study who use deep interview to the object and examine the maturity TWQ level is interesting to investigate further and possible to fill the research gap. From the maturity test, both the companies belong to norming and performing stages which indicates good teamwork in their project. Best practice from company Y to strengthen the TWQ such as doing task faster in executing stage but never neglect great planning stage in project lifecycle. Company Y has a culture that everybody in the team has their voice which beneficial to the project. Every team’s voice is being listened whenever is relevant to the project, informal meeting always performs to build team bonding and sometime is used to solve the problem in the office. This informal approach works to create closer atmosphere among project team. Company Y also suggest that target team should identify acceptance project criteria, target milestone, ground rule at the very beginning work. It is also better to create situation that boost confidence level of the team. Room for research open for examine the effect of each dimension toward the project success. More sample would be better as the representative data of Indonesian software developers. Based on the literature study, questionnaire analysis, and interviews form both companies, creating collaborative teamwork will make the team members enjoy their responsibility in the project.","garda satria industrial engineering faculty telkom university jawa barat, indonesia gsatria57@gmail.com devi pratami industrial engineering faculty telkom university jawa barat, indonesia devipratami@telkomuniversity.ac.id ika arum puspita industrial engineering faculty telkom university jawa barat, indonesia ikaarumpuspita@telkomuniversity.ac.id",

42,"Supplier Selection Using Two Phases Model  Gamal Mohamed Nowara,","supply chain management interested in the selection of suppliers against multiple criteria rather than the single criterion as a cost only. these criteria may be quantitative, qualitative or both. to choose the best supplier, the criteria are being measured or weighted for ranking. the supplier selection problem is considered as a multi-decision problem and it can be solved by the analytical hierarchical process. it allows the decision maker to structure such complex problems in the form of a hierarchy, or a set of integrated levels. in this paper, a mathematical model is combined with an analytical hierarchical process in two phases, the first phase starts by the weighted mathematical model from an exciting example, and the second phase makes the check and refines the result from the first phase by checking the consistency. and finally, a new ranking of the suppliers are obtained.",consistency test,"In this paper, both quantitative and qualitative criteria are considered and an approach is introduced, composed of two phases, phase 1 is a weighted mathematical model at which the criteria are ranked in descending order and with these weights, the final score for each supplier is obtained and from it the order of best suppliers, then the advantage of AHP in phase 2, a strategic approach to evaluate alternatives. AHP is a very useful for managerial decision making because it is flexible enough to accommodate a large set of evaluation criteria. The selection of suppliers is improved by composing the two phases that give the final ranking of suppliers as supplier 10 is the best one, and the rest of suppliers are supplier 15, supplier 17,supplier 5,supplier 1,supplier 12, and finally, the worst one is supplier 11.","mohammad abdel halim mansour and ghada mohamed abdel salam industrial engineering department zagazig university cairo, egypt schultraeger@europaschulekairo.com, mamansour68@yahoo.com, and ghadayousf22@yahoo.com",

44,Carbon Emissions Policies Impact On Reverse Supply Chain  Network,"reverse supply chain is described as an initiative that plays an important role in the global supply chain for those who seek environmentally responsible solutions for their end-of-life products. the relative economic and environmental benefits of reverse supply chain are influenced by costs and emissions during collection, transportation, recovery facilities, disassembly, recycling, remanufacturing, and disposal of unrecoverable components. the design of reverse supply chain network takes into account social, economic and environmental objectives. this research addresses the design of reverse supply chain that is also sensitive to the carbon policies under the three common regulatory policies, strict carbon caps, carbon tax, and carbon cap-and-trade. co2 emissions and total profit are integrated using a multi- criteria decision making model. in this research, a mixed integer linear programming model of reverse supply chain with full valuation of emissions is considered to determine the optimal flow of parts among multiple remanufacturing centers that will maximize the total profit with less co2 emissions, based on actual sites in the boston area. numerical example illustrates different policies and their impact on the costs and the effectiveness of emission reduction.",,"This paper has presented a reverse supply chain optimization model designed to take into account the influence of both strategic and operational activities of the supply chain on the environment. A case study based on actual sites was considered to illustrate performance of the model and to determine how the proposed policies would influence profit margins on remanufactured goods. The results indicated that the carbon price ranges that were used in this study will control the amount of GHG emissions generated in reverse supply chain operations. The results also indicated that the carbon tax policy forces a strict constraint on the amount of carbon emissions generated in supply chain operations. It shows that the RSC is sensitive to the carbon price. The work herein advances the theoretical modeling of optimal RSC systems while presenting an empirical case study of remanufactured appliances, an understudied facet of current industrial literature.

45,A System-Dynamics Based Model For Implementing Theory  Of Constraints On Healthcare Systems,"the management of the costly and limited healthcare resources such as operating rooms, doctors, nurses, and beds is challenged by the uncertainty of the arrival patients and the service rate for each type of them depending on the available resources. therefore, healthcare units encounter unbalanced utilization of such resources and unnecessary long patient’s waiting time before admission and operating rooms. a system dynamics model simulating a typical medium-sized hospital, where different types of patients are severed using the same limited resources, is developed to implement the theory of constraints philosophy. the model is used to identify the system bottleneck resource, then to exploit and to subordinate the system around this resource. the number of served patients (throughput) is increased by 6% without any resource elevation. furthermore, the model is used to determine the proper capacity needed to elevate the bottleneck resource.","system dynamics, sharing resources",,"mohamed grida, mahmoud zeid and m. adel el-baz industrial engineering department faculty of engineering, zagazig university zagazig, egypt mogrida@zu.edu.eg, mmzeid@zu.edu.eg, elbaza@mailzworld.com",
46,Performance-Based Contracts For Energy Efficiency  Projects,"energy efficiency projects are often executed by specialized entities, namely energy service companies (escos). a typical esco's core business is conducted using performance-based contracts, whereby payment terms depend on the energy savings achieved. despite their success in public, commercial, and industrial sectors, escos in the residential sector are involved in fewer projects and face several challenges. first, an energy efficiency project often leads to changed consumption behavior; hence it is more difficult to evaluate the energy savings that are due to the project itself. the second challenge is that residential clients are more risk averse and, thus, less willing to contract for projects whose outcomes are uncertain. third, a lack of monitoring protocols leads to esco's moral hazard problems. this paper studies esco contract design issues, focusing primarily on the residential market for energy efficiency. as opposed to other sectors, coordinating contracts do not exist. we show, however, that simple piecewise linear contracts work reasonably well. to improve their profitability, escos can reduce uncertainty about the technology employed and/or develop ways of verifying post-project energy efficiency. since policy makers are understandably keen to promote energy efficiency, we show also how regulations and monetary incentives can reduce inefficiencies in escos' relationships and thereby maximize environmental benefits.","sustainable energy, energy efficiency",,"liang ding stephen m. ross school of business university of michigan ann arbor, michigan, usa sam aflaki hec paris - operations management and information technology paris, france roman kapuscinski stephen m. ross school of business university of michigan ann arbor, michigan, usa",
47,Re-Formulating The Theoretical Principles Of Lean  Manufacturing In The Fourth Industrial Revolution:,"lean manufacturing and lean thinking are theoretical-practical approaches that have been consolidating over the last 25 years extending throughout the world with different emphases and ways of applying their most common tools. this article presents the first findings and conclusions about an investigation that seeks the theoretical analysis and re-construction of conceptual nuclei that revolve around these approaches within the framework of the tendencies of change associated with what has been called the fourth industrial revolution (industry 4.0), ie the revolution of cyber-physical systems of production and delivery, high interconnectivity and artificial cognition, biotechnologies and additive manufacturing, as well as integrated ecosystems. the research follows the grounded theory method with hermeneutical analysis of qualitative data collected through in-depth interviews and theoretical saturation in different lean manufacturing contexts in transnational industries located in costa rica, central america. we conclude that lean thinking must evolve according to the technological tendencies of industry 4.0, especially in the conceptualization of value, value stream and muda (waste); as well as the need to more aggressively integrate human-robot collaborative techniques in their implementation. as a future line of research is the theoretical modeling of integration ""lean-cyber-physical systems"" and its implications in service sectors.","lean manufacturing, lean thinking, grounded theory",,"a grounded theory approach eldon caldwell smart, lean and cognitive systems laboratory industrial engineering department university of costa rica san josé, costa rica eldon.caldwell@ucr.ac.cr",
48,Implementation Of Lean Manufacturing System To  Eliminate Wastes On The Production Process Of Line,"the main purpose of manufacturing industry is to produce goods economically in order to gain profit and be able to deliver products on time. ineffective and efficient production processes lead to non-current production. lean production systems help companies to be competitive, especially in terms of reducing waste (waste) that occurs in their operations. this study aims to reduce production waste in one automotive company by using waste relationship matrix (wrm), waste assessment questionnaire (waq) and value stream mapping (vsm). activities in the automotive industry is to design, develop, manufacture, market and sell motor vehicles in the world. the three methods are intended to identify and analyze the waste (waste) that occurred and make improvements to eliminate waste. from the research results obtained type of waste ""form"" is waiting and motion. while the type of waste ""to"" the inventory. the three types of waste is the greatest procession to occur in the process of assembly trimming on the production line of daihatsu sigra 1.5 l 3nr-ve, dohc dual vvt-i at pt. astra daihastu motor. then performed the improvement implementation by using wrm and vsm method obtained the results of waste efficiency that occurs in the type of waste from the motion from 17.65% to 15.75%, waiting from 15.88 to 13.12%, and lead time down from 14.202 minutes to 12.322 minutes in one assembly process trimming. some suggestions for improvements made are the implementation of the fifo system (first in first out), improving changes in movement and movement of workers, and line balancing on the assembly line trimming process lines of automobile production processes.",,"is the work of the operators in all three WIPs at point (AT-06, AT-03, AT-04) and (AT-06, AT-07, AT- 08) is not balanced. For that to balance the work of the operator so there is no waiting time the authors suggest to combine these three machines with the concept of first in first out or FIFO and Line Balancing for the division of workload on each operator so that the system works will be balanced in one line prduksi assembly electronic components This car. From the implementation results applied to PT. Astra Daihatsu Motor Training Center, the result of the repair of the original waste waiting 15.88% decreased to 13.12%. From the results of these improvements on waste reduction and waiting waste impact on the total lead time of this car trimming assembly process. Lead Time fell from 14,202 minutes to 12,322 minutes in a single line of assembly trimming process in the car production process. In other words from the application of improvements can be concluded that is able to eliminate the time of 1 sub process on the assembly line trimming of the time for 12 assembly process that is AT 1-12 becomes the time for 11 assembly process that is AT 1-11 that is decreased 1.88 minutes or 1 Minute 52.8 seconds. 4. Conclusions Based on the results of research with the method of Waste Relationship Matrix (WRM) and Value Stream Mapping (VSM) can be drawn the following conclusions: 1. Waste identification result using WRM (Waste Realtionship Matrix) and VSM (Vakue Stream Mapping) method on assembly trimming process resulted 3 biggest waste that happened that is Inventory, Motion, and Waiting. 2. Waste type ""from"" that is Motion and Waiting has the largest percentage of 17.65% and 15.88% which means that waste Motion and Waiting if it happens then have a large enough effect to cause other waste that will increase the production lead time. 3. Waste type ""to"" the Inventory has the largest percentage of 18.24% this indicates that waste inventory is the waste that most affected other waste. 4. From the improvements made to eliminate waste motion & waiting is by improving the FIFO system (First in First Out), Improving changes in the movement of workers, and Line Balancing in the assembly trimming process produces some efficiency such as: Reduced Motion waste from 17.65% to 15.75%, and Waste Waiting from 15.88 to 13.12%, and Lead Time fell from 14,202 minutes to 12,322 minutes in a single line of assembly trimming process in the car production process. In other words from the application of improvements can be concluded that is able to eliminate the time of 1 sub process on the assembly line trimming of the time for 12 assembly process that is AT 1-12 into the time for 11 assembly process is AT 1-11 that is decreased 1.88 minutes or 1 Minute 52.8 seconds. 5. Recommendations For future research related to the current research, the authors provide some suggestions as follows: 1. Preferably the object of research is not only limited to the area of assembly trimming course because this area is only one of the whole 5 line car production process. 2. Conducted an overall analysis with regard to factors in other production lines because there is a possibility in the process of production of the car there is another waste that occurs therein. 3. Created simulations with software with several production process scenarios to determine the impact or benefit of any repair recommendations and for the purpose of saving the cost of checking the improvements made. 279","assembling electronic car components with wrm and vsm method [case study in production process of daihatsu sigra type 1.5 l 3nr-ve, dohc dual vvt-i] muhammad department of industrial engineering (ie ui) faculty of engineering industrial engineering department fakultas teknik - universitas indonesia, depok 16424 tel: (021) 78888805. fax: (021) 78885656 muhammad42@ui.ac.id yadrifil department of industrial engineering (ie ui) faculty of engineering industrial engineering department fakultas teknik - universitas indonesia, depok 16424 tel: (021) 78888805. fax: (021) 78885656 yadrifil@eng.ui.ac.id","References

53,Determine The Influenced Factors Of  Facebook Ads Adoption By Smes,"discussions regarding social media have dominated research in recent years as well as the use of electronic marketing that utilizes social media. one of the preferred social media is facebook. facebook’s feature which has commonly used in online marketing is facebook ads. however, smes in indonesia have not exerted it effectively. this study aims to determine the utilization of facebook ads by smes and its influenced factors. the model applied in this research is amo (ability, motivation, and opportunity) development model. stages of model development from prior literatures achieved an adoption model with nine hypotheses. the next stages of this study is to conduct a survey using the method that is accordance with research object and research method.","facebook ads, smes, amo theory","H1: SMEs intention to use Facebook Ads positively influences their Facebook Ads Adoption. AMO theory has three groups of variables. The first variable is Motivation. Motivation Factor focused on prior research on adopted Ads (Liébana-Cabanillasa and Alonso-Dos-Santos 2017). Liebana-Cabanilas (2017) revealed that factor social image influence on adoption of Facebook- commerce. Social image is a perception of the utilization of an innovation that can enhance position in social system (Liébana-Cabanillasa and Alonso-Dos-Santos 2017). Therefore, in this study, social image has included in the category of variable motivation group. Liébana-Cabanillas (2017) and Govindaraju (2013) revealed that perceived usefulness is included in the Motivation category and may influence intention in adoption. Perceived usefulness is a person's perception that using an innovation could elevate work performance within an organization (Liébana-Cabanillasa and Alonso-Dos-Santos 2017). According to those exposures, it can be concluded that: H2: Social image has a positive effect on SMEs intention to use Facebook ads H3: perceived usefulness has a positive effect on SMEs intention to use Facebook Ads. SMEs intention to use Facebook ads must be supported by the ability and opportunity to be able to establish behavior in the form of Facebook Ads adoption (Govindaraju, et al. 2013). Govindaraju (2013) revealed that variable ability group consists of infrastructure, past experience, and self-efficacy. Infrastructure could be categorized as the condition of aptitude used to encourage the utilization of Facebook Ads by SMEs (Ouirdi, et al. 2016). Infrastructure that associated with the Facebook Ads adoption is such as hardware and software. Hardware can be a computer, pc, mobile phone, and others, whilst the software can be a web explorer and its kind. Past experience is a variable that states whether someone has experience or at least ever used an information technology in the past (Govindaraju, et al. 2013). In this study past experiences focused on prior experience or knowledge about the utilization of information technology related to Facebook Ads by SMEs. Self-efficacy is the ability of someone to achieve certain activities in this case is activity related to Facebook Ads. The higher the self-efficacy, the higher the expectation to be able to obtain a result is (Bright, et al. 2015). Therefore, it can be concluded that the higher the self-efficacy of SMEs while using Facebook Ads in online marketing, the more intention to adopt Facebook Ads. This prompted the following conclusion: H4: Infrastructure positively moderates the influence of intention to use Facebook ads on Facebook ads adoption. H5: SMEs past experiences positively moderates the influence of intention to use Facebook ads on Facebook ads adoption. H6: SMEs self-efficacy positively moderates the influence of intention to use Facebook ads on Facebook ads adoption. The next variable group in AMO theory is Opportunity. Govindaraju (2013) revealed that the opportunity variable group comprises opportunity for Facebook Ads trial, and opportunity to adjust Facebook ads. Opportunity for Facebook ads trial is an opportunity for SMEs to be able to use 305","aulia f. hadining industrial engineering department state university of singaperbangsa karawang karawang, indonesia aulia.fasha@gmail.com sukanta industrial engineering department state university of singaperbangsa karawang karawang, indonesia sukanta.tsm@gmail.com","References

54,Heuristics For Maximizing The Total Weight Of Just-In-Time  Jobs Under Multi-Slot Conditions,"we focus on a problem maximizing the total weight of just-in-time jobs under multi-slot conditions. in just-in-time scheduling, each job has to be completed exactly on its due date. since just-in-time scheduling has applications to both manufacturing and computer systems, a number of research papers on such scheduling problems exist. under multi-slot conditions, each job has one due date per time slot and has to be completed just-in-time on one of its due dates. we assume that each job has a certain weight per time slot, and the weight is non-increasing with increasing completion time for each job. this problem maximizing the total weight of just-in-time jobs under multi-slot conditions was recently proven to be np-hard. our research presents two heuristics for this problem. the first is a simple greedy algorithm, in which each job is scheduled in the order of largest to smallest on weight for each time slot. the second applies a well-known algorithm for a weighted interval scheduling problem to this problem. we implement the two heuristics, and compare their performances from computational experimentation.","scheduling, algorithm, heuristics, just-in-time, time slot",,"ryo saito graduate school of science and engineering hosei university 3-7-2 kajino-cho, koganei-shi, tokyo 184-8584, japan ryo.saito@stu.housei.ac.jp eishi chiba department of industrial and systems engineering hosei university 3-7-2 kajino-cho, koganei-shi, tokyo 184-8584, japan e-chiba@hosei.ac.jp",
55,Attitudes Towards Road Safety Among Pre-Drivers:  The Case Of Qatar,"a preliminary study involving school students aged 12-18 years attempted to test whether there is difference in attitudes towards road safety between arab and non-arab respondents. the sampled participants were categorized according to age group, ethnicity and type of school they attend. responses on their perceived driving ability, basic road safety knowledge and their willingness to participate in a common road safety campaign were analyzed. the results show that arab students of pre-driving age tend to perceive that they have the skills to drive and showed poorer attitude towards road safety than non-arab students. older students of arab origin and in public schools are more likely not to participate in road safety campaigns as compared to the younger age group of non-arab origin and in private schools. attitude change interventions that is appealing to pre-drivers of arab origin studying in public school could be more effective strategy to raise the road safety awareness in par with the rest of the residents. carefully designed contents for driving simulators that convey interactive road safety lessons and variable message signs (vms) can be considered and maximize effectiveness of road safety campaigns.","students, arab, pre-drivers","In general, Arab students in public schools of Qatar show higher perception of driving ability coupled with lower attitudes towards basic road safety elements. The product of such combination underestimates the risks involved in driving and could be the reason for the prevalence of under-age driving on the roads of Qatar. This paper can be considered a preliminary research on male students of pre-driving age and highlights the dire need for attitude change intervention. Road safety education program is commonly employed on pre-driving age students with the intention to inform the development of their attitudes and beliefs related to driving. However there is lack of evaluation of such programs making it difficult to assess their effectiveness. Tailoring road safety education program based on what appeals to the target audience would be beneficial. This research work found that it would be more effective to target Arab students in primarily public schools. Active participation, and use of personal experiences are more likely to be successful if included in road safety education program. Despite the lack of evidence that support use of ITS to deliver road safety message in pre-driving age, interactive and creative tools that is engaging may be worthwhile. One of the techniques to increase road safety awareness is the usage of driving simulators to convey interactive road safety lessons and Variable Message Signs (VMS), which are electronic boards placed along arterials and highways, to deliver awareness messages as well as traffic information. These messages should consider the characteristics of the targeted audience to maximize effectiveness and compliance.

64,Open Innovation In Service Sector  Pimprabha Sirito,"open innovation is a paradigm suggesting that firms should seek external pathways, knowledge and capabilities in their product development process. several companies have benefited from open innovation giving the concept high attention from the academia and businesses. however, despite service sector’s high economic contributions, open innovation in the sector is still under-researched. this study focuses on how service companies implement open innovation for new product development. the study is in terms of the process types, networks, steps, outcomes and barriers involved in the open innovation process. because open innovation process is affected by the industrial characteristics, only selected industries, which include financial institutions, telecommunications and knowledge-intensive industries, were studied. the study closes the gap in the academic area as well as provides managerial insights for firms in service sector. to answer the research questions, interviews were conducted with service companies in thailand and responses were analyzed resulting in new findings about open innovation. keyword innovation, open, service, knowledge 1. introduction open innovation refers to a paradigm suggesting that firms should go beyond their boundaries and that ideas do not have to be originated or further developed only within the firms’ boundaries. in other words, companies should open their innovation management by integrating external knowledge or by bringing the ideas developed internally outside. open innovation involves utilizing the business models that integrate the external and internal knowledge to create value while define the mechanism to capture that value. (chesbrough, 2003) studies on open innovation are mostly done within the context of manufacturing sector. however, no study has been done particularly on how open innovation is practiced in service sector, which in today’s industrialized world, exhibits the highest contribution towards the economy. whilst there are evidences that companies in the sector have practiced open innovation, the implementation process has not been sufficiently studied and documented.(mention, 2011; mention & asikainen, 2012; patrick schueffel1, 2015) therefore, because of the rising significance of service sector, it is worthwhile to investigate how service firms practice open innovation. this study answers the question: how has open innovation been implemented in service sector –particularly companies in financial institutions, telecommunications and knowledge-intensive industries? the selected industries generated rapid growth in gross domestic product (gdp) shares in the last two decades. (eichengreen & gupta, 2013) the question covers five areas of interest including 1) type of processes used, 2) roles and types of partners, 3) steps companies took, 4) short and long-term outcomes and 5) internal and external barriers. this study begins with the literature review and research question. next is the methodology, followed by interview results. the study ends with the conclusion which includes managerial implications, limitations and future work. 352",,,"school of mechanical and manufacturing engineering the university of new south wales (unsw) sydney 2052, australia pim_sirito@hotmail.com maruf hasan school of mechanical and manufacturing engineering the university of new south wales (unsw) sydney 2052, australia m.hasan@unsw.edu.au","References

65,District Model With Multiple Types Of Vehicles For  Transporting Sugarcane,the goal of sugar mill management is to decrease total cost of supply chain while provided high percent of service level to customers. the transportation cost is an important effect to the total cost of the supply chain. the number of cane fields are rapidly grown in the thailand which resulting in increasing the transportation cost. this paper introduces a policy which allocating the vehicles and cane fields to each district for managing transportation system of raw material to sugar mill. the decision of which unit of cane fields and unit of vehicles to allocate to each district is complicated. we develop the previous districting problem when the transportation system considers multiple types of vehicles; six-wheel trucks and ten-wheel trucks. we determine the optimal policy for allocating cane fields and vehicles to district as minimize the total cost of transportation cost. randomly samples of small real world problems to be used as an input data for verifying our mathematical model and used a heuristic approach to near-optimal in reason of a computer running time. the results of this paper show that the heuristic answer provides more efficiency than traditional policy for managing transportation system of sugar mill.,"district, transportation, heuristic 364",,"rujirat patcharamethanon and kanchala sudtachart school of manufacturing engineering, institute of engineering suranaree universuty of technology nakhon ratchasima, thailand rujirat.pn@gmail.com, kanchala@sut.ac.th",
66,Investigation On The Effect Of Types Of Nanoparticles And  Temperature On Nanoparticles-Foam Stability,"foam has been proposed as a mobility control agent in gas-based enhanced oil recovery. however, surfactant-based foam stability deteriorates at higher temperature. currently, nanoparticles have been widely tested in foamability and foam stability. hence, this paper is aimed to investigate the stability of nanoparticles-foam at different temperatures using 5,000 ppm anionic alpha olefin sulfonate surfactant in 3.0 wt% sodium chloride, and 1.0 wt% of sodium hydroxide to control the system ph. silicon dioxide and aluminium oxide nanoparticles were used to examine the effect of nanoparticles in stabilizing foam. foam stability was measured based on foam half-life in static condition. the performance of the nanoparticles were analysed at 25°c, 40°c, 60°c and 90°c. it was found that aluminium oxide nanoparticles enhanced foam better compared to silicon dioxide nanoparticles. these results were supported with the microscopic observation of foam structure and lamellae inside the glass tube. these findings contributed to the understanding of the effects of nanoparticles in enhancing foam stability.","nanoparticles, temperature, foam stability","Generally, the presence of nanoparticles does not significantly enhance the foamability in both neutral and alkaline base fluids with increasing temperature. However, the foamability by CO2 gas sparging seems behaves differently at temperature below and at 90°C. In agreement with most of the previous literatures, while foam half-life degraded with increasing temperature, the presence of nanoparticles did enhance its half-life at that temperature. Based on results obtained from this experiment, aluminium oxide possessed better stabilizing effect than silicon dioxide at all temperature regardless the system pH. From the microscopic foam images, adding nanoparticles in foam do not change the shape of bubble at any time and any condition. Nevertheless, the presence of nanoparticles in foam could retard its liquid drainage rate and thus slowing down the bubble coalescence process that will eventually increase foam half-life and stability at any temperature.

67,A Simple Algorithm To Validate Triangular Inequalities In  Routing Problems,"routing of vehicles is a common application in logistics. given rising complexity when the number of nodes is increasing, exact solutions are hard to find and researchers turn their attention more to heuristics or metaheuristics for large-scale problems. these approaches are usually based on certain assumptions and satisfying the assumptions is often the key to effective and efficient implementation of the approach. one typical assumption in routing problems is called triangular inequality which states that the sum of distances between two connecting arcs should be larger or at least the same with the distance between the outer nodes of those arcs. in euclidean setting, this assumption will not be violated. however, in real-life applications, we depend on external tool such as google maps to obtain distances between locations. in so doing, it is possible to violate the inequality assumption. this paper aims to rectify that problem by proposing a simple algorithm that can adjust and validate the triangular inequality assumption on a given dataset of distances. the algorithm will be tested on a case study in a distributor company and sensitivity analysis will be outlined to find the relationship between the number of nodes and algorithm complexity.","routing problems, indonesia",,"eric wibisono dept. of industrial engineering, faculty of engineering university of surabaya surabaya, indonesia ewibisono@staff.ubaya.ac.id",

69,Resilience Of Logistics Service Providers Facing A Port  Strike: A Case Study,"the purpose of this paper is to study the impact of a stevedores’ port strike on logistics service providers. it aims to analyze the negative effects caused by this disruption, and the strategies logistics service providers may implement to sustain their performance levels and quickly recover from disruption. with this objective, a case study comprising three logistics service providers is developed. there are evidence that ""handling and management cargo delay"", ""delay in deliver of orders"" and ""incapacity to fulfill orders"" are the stevedores’ port strike negative effects with high impact and frequency. because of these negative effects the logistics service providers’ key performance indicators related to reputation, loss of capacity and operation stoppage are diminished.","resilience, port operations, supply chain 385","The purpose of this study was to understand better how logistics service providers can be more resilient when facing a port strike, using as a case study the recurrent strikes in the port of Lisbon from 2012 to 2014. Using the case study empirical data it is possible to conclude that a stevedores’ strike triggers several negative effects in logistics service providers that will eventually severely impair the whole SC. The most critical negative effect, regarding impact, is the ""Loss of access to Hinterland,"" since it leads to loss of service in the companies under study. However, this negative effect has a low occurrence frequency, which makes it more manageable by the logistics service providers. The analysis of the negative effects severity (impact versus frequency) allows to identify the ""Delay in cargo handling and management,"" ""Delay in deliver of orders,"" and ""Incapacity to fulfill orders"" as the ones that have aggravated consequence on the logistics service providers operations. These negative effects reflect the material flow disruption that occurs on the SC during the stevedore's strike. Therefore, a stevedores strike will have a high impact in port activities, and the worst case scenario can cause a port clogging. These results are in line with previous researchers where the stevedore's strike is identified as one of the disruption with high impact in all port operations. The negative effects were spread along the SC; the logistics service providers role is to minimize or avoid the propagation of the material flow disruption along the SC; they act as ""buffers"" and deploy a set of resilient strategies to assure the cargo delivery on time or to reduce the delay. All the companies under study consider that the anticipated communication with the port authorities is essential to prevent the strike negative effects. The freight forwarders deploy resilient strategies such as reroute cargo to other ports, so their customers receive the product on time or resort to outsourcing. The shipping companies tend to analyze other options, especially if they have other ports nearby that can ""replace"" the one in question or adapt their partnership strategies in areas such as geographic positioning, possible alliances, level of integration in their customers’ services, among others. The port operators rely mostly on the negotiations with the stevedores' unions, and if necessary it resorts to outsourcing since during the strike period the available resources are depleted. This study contributes to highlight the necessity of the logistics service providers to work with contingency plans and be prepared to adopt a set of resilient strategies to mitigate the negative effects that come from a disruption, which can be motivated by for example a stevedores’ port strike. It would be very interesting if, to better understand the magnitude of this problem, future research about port strikes could present more quantitative data, instead of mainly qualitative. In particular, studies analyzing the impact of resilience strategies on KPIs would be useful in assessing the effectiveness of these strategies. Also, future studies should take into account the end customer, who will bring a new perspective to this issue.

70,Life Cycle Impacts For Electricity Generation From Wind  Source,"wind power is a renewable energy source, which is relatively evenly distributed over many regions of the world. wind power plant requires no fuel input to produce electricity, thus, wind energy is emission free during its conversion process. however, manufacturing of wind power plant components such as turbine requires several materials, processes, energy, transports, natural resources, and disposal stages during its whole life cycle stages. for a complete understanding of impacts of electric energy generation using wind turbine, it is necessary to analyze the emissions and other impacts over the entire life cycle stages of a wind turbine. this study makes a complete life cycle analysis (lca) of wind energy to determine the impacts for each functional unit (i.e. 1kwh of electric energy) over the entire life cycle of a wind turbine. lca tool simapro has been employed to define the scopes and goals of the analysis and to perform inventory and impact assessment. data has been collected from ecoinvent database sources. this study found that overall negative impacts for electric energy generation are 1.58 pt (pt is a unit for environmental loading) and 339.8 pt for wind source and energy mix in malaysia, respectively. this study results mean that electric energy generation using wind turbine has much less negative impacts than fossil based energy mix.","simapro, wind turbine, lca, characterization","This study evaluates the life cycle impacts for electricity production from renewable wind source and electricity from Malaysian energy mix. Life cycle impacts provide a comprehensive view of the environmental aspects of the product (i.e. electricity) and a more accurate picture of the true environmental trade-offs in selecting resources. LCA enables the estimation of the cumulative environmental impacts resulting from all stages in the product’s whole life cycle (e.g. raw material extraction, material transportation, ultimate product disposal etc.). This study first determined characterization results against 15 different impact categories for electricity generation from both wind and energy mix. All the impact categories are found to have much lower negative impact for wind based electricity than energy mix. The resultant damages for these impacts are consequently lower for wind electricity. For example, damage to human health is 2.52E-09 DALY for wind based electricity whereas this damage for electricity mix is 1.36E-06 DALY. We have also normalized the impacts into a single unit, for a comparison. Total environmental impacts for wind based electricity are 1.58 Pt whereas it is 339.8 Pt for energy mix. Among the damages, climate change has the major impacts with 82 Pt for energy mix and 0.64 Pt for wind electricity. This analysis will help decision-makers select the resources or their mixes that results in the least impact to the human health and environment with same amount of output.

71,Safe Human-Machine Centered Design Of An Assembly  Station In A Learning Factory Environment,"learning factories allow both, students and professionals, to learn new approaches in production technology in practice. the transition from manual assembly to hybrid assembly towards an almost fully automated assembly can be arranged in learning factories in a practical way. hybrid assembly specially shows a lot of potential, as it is designed to be adopted in situations with an increasing number of variants or customized products as well as the need for a scalable production system. in the modern view of the fourth industrial revolution (industry 4.0) in hybrid assembly systems, machines or robots are operating hand in hand with the human worker. this paper provides an approach to human-machine centered design of assembly systems and describes their implementation on a case study in the mini-factory laboratory of the free university of bolzano. the paper describes a case study, where a previously only manually produced product is produced in a hybrid assembly system in combination with a lightweight robot. as part of the man-machine interaction this work analyses risks for the safety of the human worker and provides appropriate measures. the work finally concludes with a summary and an outlook for the future.","safety, assembly systems, learning factory","With regard to the development towards smart factories of the future, new challenges arise for companies as well as for young engineers. The increasing sales volumes of lightweight robots and their increased use in industry forces both universities and companies to train their students and employees in human-machine interaction. In this context, a hybrid station for the human-machine interaction was developed in the learning factory “smart mini-factory” of the Free University of Bolzano. In addition to the manual assembly according to Lean principles, students can also test a safe integration of automated tasks into common assembly processes in the lab environment. In order to ensure a safe cooperation between humans and the robot, an analysis of the safety functions of the robot as well as a subsequent risk analysis and derivation of design requirements for the assembly station were carried out. The main goal of this case study research was to provide a workstation in a realistic industrial lab environment, where students can learn, practice and test how a safe human-machine workplace should be designed. The approach how to analyze the risk of a workstation with man-machine interaction based on the PILZ method can be applied in many situations and industries. Especially in situations where assembly tasks should be fulfilled by workers and robots or automated stations, this approach helps to evaluate the improvement of a redesigned workstation from the safety viewpoint. There are still limitations of the current work in testing the PILZ method in a case study. The main limitations lie in the number of case studies itself. Thus, future research should be done by conducting more case studies and by developing a software application to do such an analysis in a user-friendly way directly at the workstation.

72,Five-Segment Resource Circulation Model  Using Shortcut Transitions,"― understanding resource circulation is vital for addressing environmental problems. in the past, resource circulation between the earth’s natural and societal spaces was balanced. however, due to recent mass production, consumption, and disposal in societal space, such resource circulation is no longer balanced. in this paper, we further develop the domain transition probability model for resource circulation that we proposed previously, and suggest a new five-segment resource circulation model that can consider shortcuts between the domains within it. this model can consider a supply chain consisting of manufacturers and suppliers in societal space, and can be used to analyze the effects of environmental activities on societal space. this model provides several suggestions about the impacts of activities, such as artificial waste purification, recycling, and inventory disposal, on resource circulation, which are based on the results of simple numerical simulations. this model also indicates towards new directions for environmental activities that can improve the earth’s environment.","earth environment, reduce, reuse, recycle","In this paper, we added shortcut domain transitions to a five-segment domain transition probability model using the 3R matrix, and compared various situations through simple numerical simulation. We verified the relative magnitudes of the impacts of different environmental activities on societal space. Based on the model presented here, reduction activities by suppliers are more effective than artificial purification conducted by manufacturers and consumers, and the reduction of unsold food waste can effectively reduce the inventory of the entire supply chain. It was found that recycling iron as parts rather than as scraps would be preferable. As the simulations were based on numerical examples set by the authors, they may deviate from actual events in society.

76,Analysis Of A Customer Relationship Management Tool In A  Shipping Company,"today’s society is technologically advanced, the world is just a click away and our companies’ customers have easy access to all the information. therefore, they are increasingly demanding, wanting more and better at a lower cost. using as a case study a shipping company, a system of customer relationship management (crm) was analysed to verify what reasons led to its abandonment and to realise what to do to reverse such situation. in this industry product differentiation is practically null, so the customer’s choice comes down to price. however, customers are paying more attention to customer service, therefore companies are developing stronger relationships with them. the construction of such relationships implies data collection on the client, from which one can offer services of greater value. this may lead to partnerships and competitive advantages. thus, the use of crm tools is being promoted for crm tools present themselves as a valuable asset. in the end, suggestions are presented, ranging from improvements to the existing system, to more complex suggestions, costlier or breaking with the existing mode of relationship and dialogue between company and customers, but that, in the future, will certainly translate into advantages over competing companies.","crm, shipping, customer service",,"teresa pereira institute of engineering of porto of polytechnic institute of porto, isep/p.porto, research center of mechanical engineering (cidem) rua dr. antónio bernardino de almeida, 431, 4200-072, porto, portugal. mtp@isep.ipp.pt joana fróis polytechnic institute of porto, apnor/p.porto, rua dr. roberto frias, 712, 4200-465 porto, portugal joaninhafrois@gmail.com fernanda a. ferreira school of hospitality and tourism of polytechnic institute of porto, cith/p.porto, applied management research unit (uniag), rua d. sancho i, 981 4480-876, vila do conde, portugal faf@esht.ipp.pt","References

78,Performance Metric Development To Visualize Setup Losses  In Wire Bond Process,"performance metric is one of the components of a continuous improvement to achieve and maintain the performance of the machine or process. setup and changeover losses are one of the losses that increase the lead time and reduce the available time for the operation of machine. despite of work study that used widely in industry to reduce the losses, there is no effective measurement tool to monitor the setup and changeover losses. furthermore, excessive working time and idle time are the main focus of the people to improve, but they may miss out the other important element, the frequency of setup process in a period of time. the objective of this study is to visualize the setup losses through performance metric. therefore, usability and human factor are introduced to measure the frequency of the setup process in a period of time and highlight the excessive working time to be further streamlined. real data was examined by using the performance metric and it showed that the performance metric able to visualize the setup losses. it is expected to visualize the setup and changeover losses in the industry and assist the user to tackle the issue correctly.","usability, human factor, setup losses","Setup loss is one of the factors that reduce the flexibility of the production time. High setup losses in the production might lengthen the time for the industry to respond to the changes of the customer demand. The usability and human factor can be the performance metric used to quantify the setup losses and allow the production team to identify the area of improvement effectively. Furthermore, these two performance metrics allow users to monitor and measure the setup and changeover process regarding the process scheduling and performance of the manpower. As shown in the result, the high setup time might not only caused by the excessive setup time, but also the frequency of the setup and changeover process. This is necessary for the production team to identify to tackle on the correct waste in an efficient way. These performance metrics are expected to give a better picture to the companies in quantifying the setup losses and assist companies in identification of area of improvement. In future, it can be implemented with other tools and techniques to improve the performance of the manpower. 463","puvanasvaran a. perumal and yoong sai sieng faculty of manufacturing engineering universiti teknikal malaysia melaka durian tunggal, melaka, malaysia punesh@utem.edu.my, saisiengyoong@gmail.com tay choo chuan faculty of electrical engineering universiti teknikal malaysia melaka durian tunggal, melaka, malaysia tay@utem.edu.my","References

79,Prediction Model Of Tensile Strength Property In Friction  Stir Welding Using Artificial Neural Network (Anns),"for years, manufacturing industry faced challenges in conserving high cost and efficiency in research and development of products especially in relation to welding structure. to handle this problem, this research conducts an effort to develop methods to determine tensile strength properties of friction stir welding (fsw) in aluminum alloy using prediction model. an artificial intelligent technique, i.e. artificial neural network (anns) is used to develop the prediction model. initial work involves fsw welding experiment and testing of subsequent result to analyze the tensile strength properties of the welding structure based on process parameter input. prediction model is developed based on back propagation (bp) of error to predict tensile strength of the fsw structure. input parameters for the model is tool rotational speed and travel speed while output of the model is the tensile strength of fsw welded structures. proposed prediction model is then trained with experiment data. testing of the proposed prediction model was then conducted using unused experiment data from the training. research result shows that proposed prediction model is aligned with experiment data. this shows that average error value from the training and testing is 0.010286 or very small (close to zero) which means that the desired output of the prediction model for the training and testing is close to each other. result from regression graph for training and testing shows matching linear regression between output and target when compared to dash line of the ideal result. this shows an absolute linear relationship where r equals to 0.9 or close to 1. this proves good compatibility the prediction model.",,"In this research, Artificial Neural Network (ANNs) is used to predict FSW welding parameter in Aluminum 6061- T6 alloy. Rotational speed and travel speed tools are considered to be ANN’s model inputs. An effective parameter from the FSW process for tensile strength is modelled. MSE value from training and testing is 0.010286 or very small (close to zero) which means that the desired output and ANN’s output for training set and testing become very close to each other. On the other hand, results derived from the regression graphs of training and testing show that the linear regression line between output and target compared to dash line of perfect result (ideal condition) have the right linear relationship where the R value equals to 0.9 or very close to 1. This shows a good fit. Acknowledgements Author would like to acknowledge for financial support from Bina Nusantara University by Penelitian Hibah BINUS 2017 for funding this research activity.

80,Resource Management Using Simulation At The Airport  Ma Nang Laik,"to improve the airport’s operation, we use monte carlo simulation to determine the optimal number of check-in counters required for a single flight with 200 scheduled passengers in a 2-hour check-in period. our analysis of the passenger arrival pattern supported that the inter-arrival time can be approximated using an exponential distribution. by using the monte carlo simulation model with increasing number of check-in counters, we were able to conclude that three check-in counters were optimal to satisfy the service level requirement that at least 90% of the passengers must be served within 10 minutes upon arrival at the check-in queue. in additional, we further extend our analysis to cater for different passenger loads from 50 to 550 and determine the linear relationship between the number of counters required and passenger load.","queuing, check-in counter, airport operation, simulation","& future work In this paper, we are concerned with the optimal number of check-in counter required in an airport to service the passengers within 10 minutes after their arrival for a single flight. Due to the randomness of passenger arrival and service time, we have employed Monte Carlo Simulation method using Excel spreadsheet to solve the problem. Our analysis of the passenger arrival pattern supported that the inter-arrival time can be approximated to follow an exponential distribution, with the maximum absolute deviation (a measure of goodness of fit) between the Cumulative Relative Frequency of the sample data and the Cumulative Distribution Function of the fitted distribution to be 0.02. Our simulation template allowed us to perform the simulation and collect performance indicators such as average total system time, average waiting time, average queue length and the 90th percentile of 480","senior lecturer, school of business singapore university of social sciences 461 clementi road, singapore 599491 nlma@suss.edu.sg murphy choy heriot-watt university edinburgh business school edinburgh, scotland, united kingdom goladin@gmail.com","References

82,Self-Responsibility In Employability Competencies  Development: Perceptions From Australian Engineering,"as the competencies demanded by the labour market has changed, engineering graduates have to proactively be self-responsible by participating in competency-enhancing activities to possess competencies needed by the labour market. without any learners’ sense of self-responsibility (sr), competency development only creates low quality engineering graduates. therefore, this study examines the perceptions of 1056 students and alumni of australian engineering schools regarding sr in their employability competencies development process. findings show that the engagements of both participants were extrinsically motivated. however, the alumni participants had internalised their extrinsic motivations into positive behaviours, including self-initiation, persistence, motivation and independency. as a consequence, the alumni participants felt a greater sense that sr is an integral part of themselves, expressed through their capability to be self-initiated, highly persistent, motivated and independent in navigating their competency development without relying on their friends, families or instructors. in relation to the external circumstances affecting the perceptions of sr, the participants did not associate their perspective of sr with their prior development experience in high schools but rather they associated it with their recent experiences within the engineering school environments. this finding has implications for how sr could help learners at university level to internalise their external motivations.","self-responsibility, employability","This study has outlined the perceptions of the Australian engineering student and alumni about the role of SR in their employability competencies development process. The results of statistical analyses positively support the importance of SR and its four factors in the process of assisting students to find their own approaches in managing their own competencies development. With respect to this capability, the participants also have a common perspective about the freedom to manage their own development process along with the consequences. This sense of freedom is easier to be conceptualised than to be implemented in real development situations. For learners who come completed high school overseas, the freedom to self-manage the development process is probably a new concept. For years, they have depended on teachers/instructors in managing their personal development where all learning decisions were made by other persons. Therefore, learners’ role was to passively wait to be directed by the others and fail to effectively engage in competency-enhancing activities. This failure was shown by some student participants, particularly those who were new to the engineering school environment. Unless they could less-depend on their friends, instructors and institutions, they could not fully exercise the concept of SR in their own development process and may easily give up when confronted by perceived barriers. In contrast, self-responsible learners could develop their own approaches for effectively managing their own development process. This capability was demonstrated by the alumni participants who had internalised/integrated their external motivations into positive behaviours associated with being self-responsible learners, such as: self- organise, self-control, self-regulate, self-confidence and self-reflective. At this stage, the alumni participants understood the importance of SR for their competencies development process and transformed the concept of SR into their own development philosophy. As a consequence, the alumni participants felt a greater sense that SR is an integral part of themselves, expressed through their capability to be self-initiated, highly persistent, motivated and independent in navigating their competency development without relying on their friends, families or instructors. This finding has implications for how SR could help learners at university level to internalise their external motivations. Like the process of constructing knowledge, SR is not something that is teachable or that automatically appears during the development process. Rather, SR is a self-determined process, guided by learners’ consciousness, reflected in their awareness to self-examine their own structure of their development, including their competencies weaknesses. Therefore, when an engineering school provides an effective design of constructivist instructional environments, the perceived experiences may support learners’ previous experiences and, in a positive way, become a stimulus for learners to accept SR for their own development process. On the micro level of instructional design, the effect of recent experiences in the development process also point to the creation of supportive environments that enrich their prior development experiences. 503","student and alumni daudi lazarus department of electrical and information engineering pontianak state polytechnic (polnep), west kalimantan, indonesia email: daudilazarus.polnep@gmail.com, d.lazarus@polnep.ac.id","References

83,"Redesigning Of Lamp Production Assembly Line  Bung Wai Kit, Ezutah Udoncy Olugu And Zuliani Zulkoffli","manufacturing productivity is one of the most significant element that determines the position of a manufacturing company. the efficiency of an assembly line directly affects the productivity. a case study of lamp production assembly line was conducted in order to develop an improved version of assembly line with greater efficiency. this study was carried out by theoretically analyzing the various studies conducted previously on assembly line optimization. process and time study of the current assembly line were conducted. sequel to the data collected, root cause analysis was conducted to identify the cause of the problem in the assembly lines. flexsim was used to simulate current assembly line and the performance result was generated. the result was analyzed using lean production review. a karakuri system was implemented to eliminate the non-value added operations. subsequently, assembly line balancing was applied by using 4 different heuristics methods. as a result, 4 versions of improved assembly line were developed. furthermore, 4 versions of improved simulations on assembly line were conducted and the result of performance were generated. lastly, comparison between the current assembly line and 4 versions of improved assembly line was conducted and the most productive assembly line was proposed.",assembly line,"and Recommendations By implementing the methodology, three objectives of this study were met and achieved. First of all, a root cause analysis of the current lamp product assembly line was conducted. It was found that, the assembly line was having imbalance workstation time among the workstations. Furthermore, the operators were having uneven work load. These are the causes of bottlenecks, idles, blockages, non-processing and low utilization which eventually led to poor smoothness index of 108.25 and low line efficiency of 66.56%. An improved version of assembly line was developed based on the assembly line balancing. Number of Predecessor (NOP) improved version assembly line which gained the highest score in Table 4.25 had been selected as the proposed assembly line among all the versions. This assembly line consists of three Kakaruri Flow Racks which eliminate non value added motion, transportation and waiting. Lastly, a simulation model of Number of Predecessor (NOP) improved version assembly line was developed and simulation had been conducted using FlexSim. The proposed assembly line consists only 6 operators and workstations while current assembly line consists of 7 operators and workstations. Furthermore, the assembly line performance has been improved. The overall tasks processing and operators’ utilization have been improved by 0.49% and 14.41% respectively. On the other hand, the tasks blockage and operators idle percentage have been reduced by 17% and 13.73% respectively. Besides that, the tasks had been evenly distributed to every operator in every workstation after assembly line balancing and results in the overall tasks idle percentage is increased by 7.43%. Moreover, the line efficiency is improved by 19.11% (from 66.56% to 85.67%) and the smoothness index has been reduced from 108.25 to 46.60. Lastly, the production rate is increased from 32.25 unit per hour to 36.38 unit per hour. Therefore, the proposed assembly line is capable of producing 291 units of headlamp in one day of operation. Throughout the research, it was found that there are several studies can be done in the future to further improve the assembly line. Firstly, research on cost analysis can be conducted in order to provide an even better and more concrete validation of assembly line improvement. This can be done through comparison of expenditures including materials, labor and overhead costs between the current and improved version of assembly line. Furthermore, manufacturing process is one of the most significant element in providing high manufacturing efficiency. A well designed manufacturing process is beneficial in several aspects including time, costs and resources reduction and ensure high quality of assembly and fabrication. Hence, research on process optimization is highly recommended to be conducted. Lastly, with the advancement of technology, research on technology implementation can be conducted. Technologies such as robotic assembly arm, automated conveying systems, automated packing systems, computer-integrated manufacturing or even Artificial Intelligence are capable of being adopted in the assembly line as a means of improving the performance of assembly line.","faculty of engineering, mechanical engineering department ucsi university, 56000 kuala lumpur bungwaikit@gmail.com,",

85,A Fuzzy Supplier Selection Model Considering Social  Responsibility In Supply Chain,"due to high importance of supplier selection in supply chain management issues and also taking into consideration the fact that organizations are giving more and more attention to their responsibilities in the society; this paper considers supplier selection as a multi-objective decision making problem. it inserts social responsibility (sr) parameter into the model and ensures that specification of each supplier’s allocated quota from a total order uses such criterion. in supplier selection problem, objectives such as cost minimization, quality maximization and on-time delivery maximization have been generally studied. in order to effectively consider sr, we also take note of other objectives such as suppliers’ sr maximization, distance minimization, etc. due to its linear dependency property, sr observance by the suppliers can lead to higher quality level (products and services) and on-time delivery. thus the proposed approach also incorporates quality and on-time delivery objectives into sr parameter. furthermore, it uses a triangular fuzzy number regarding uncertainty and ambiguity in the sr observance level at the end of each period. on top of a mathematical model for a multi-product structure, numerical examples that employ fuzzy multi objective decision making method, are presented so as to justify the approach as well as its values.",supplier selection,"In the recent years, supplier selection and evaluation has become one of the most important issues in supply chain management and organizations have great concerns about CSR observance. This paper proposed a mathematical model that incorporates SR on top of other traditional parameters such as cost minimization, quality maximization, on-time delivery maximization, etc. A multi-objective model having six objective functions of cost, quality, on-time delivery, utility, SR and distance for suppliers, developed as a linear and integer programming, was presented. Selection of suppliers were carried out by minimizing their cost and distance objective functions and maximizing their quality, on-time delivery, utility and SR objective functions. Considering the mathematical complexity of the proposed model, we also demonstrated the selection process via numerical examples using our two different approaches for converting fuzzy numbers into non-fuzzy numbers. Although each conversion approach resulted in a different answer, something which is related to the fuzzy nature of the problem, both approaches selected suppliers that had higher SR under various states. In summary, this research not only integrated a very important social concept for supplier selection and evaluation, i.e., SR observance according ISO26000 standard, but also showed that such activity can even help organizations to achieve and maintain their competitive advantage in the market. 534","abolfazl aliakbaria, mehdi seifbarghyb, davar pishvac a faculty of industrial and mechanical engineering, qazvin branch, islamic azad university, qazvin, iran, abolfazl.aliakbari@gmail.com b department of industrial engineering, alzahra university, tehran, iran, m.seifbarghy@alzahra.ac.ir c faculty of asia pacific studies, ritsumeikan asia pacific university, beppu, japan dpishva@apu.ac.jp","References

87,"Design Of Multiattribute Ewma Chart  Mohammad Shamsuzzamana, Salah Haridyb","multiattribute control charts have been widely found to be more effective process control than separate uniattribute control charts in different applications. based on an available statistical model which was developed for designing multiattribute np (mnp) chart, in this study we proposed a multiattribute exponentially weighted moving average (mewma) chart. we also compared the mewma chart with the optimal version of the (mnp) chart. the comparison results indicate that the proposed mewma chart outperforms the mnp chart by about 65% in terms of the average number of defectives.",control chart,"Due to the fast advancement in technology and high competition in industry, monitoring only one quality characteristic is no longer practical. It is required to simultaneously control multiple quality characteristics. There is currently an urgent need for the multattribute control charts to provide a summary measure of all quality characteristics in a multiattribute process and achieve more effective process control than the separate uniattribute charts. This article presents a new MEWMA chart for monitoring the multiattribute processes. The MEWMA chart is found to outperform the Mnp chart proposed by Jolayemi (1999) in terms of AND. It is more effective than the Mnp chart by 65%. The implementation of the MEWMA chart is simple and its optimal charting parameters can be straightforwardly determined using a computer program. In this article, the studies are conducted based on some assumptions, such as the independency of the attribute defects, and the known in-control fraction nonconforming. It is interesting to make a further study in the future to see how the MEWMA chart will perform when the attribute characteristics are dependent and there is a correlation between them. It is also worthwhile to evaluate the performance of the MEWMA chart when p0 is estimated and d follows other distributions rather than the binomial distribution.","sustainable engineering asset management (seam) research group department of industrial engineering and engineering management university of sharjah sharjah 27272, united arab emirates amshamsuzzaman@sharjah.ac.ae; bsharidy@sharjah.ac.ae linda zhang ieseg school of management (lem-cnrs) lille-paris, france l.zhang@ieseg.fr",
88,Single Vendor-Buyer Integrated Inventory Model For  Deteriorating Items Considering Carbon Emission,"in this study, we present an integrated single vendor-buyer inventory model considering deterioration and carbon emission simultaneously. we focus on the emissions from warehousing, transport activity as well as emission from the disposal of the deteriorated items. a numerical example is developed to illustrate the proposed solution procedure. computational results indicate that by incorporating carbon emissions into the integrated inventory model, we can reduce the total carbon emission and slightly reduce the total supply chain cost. we also show that the integrated inventory model has significantly reduced the total cost and total carbon emissions as compared to the result when the decision is made solely from the buyer’s perspective.",social,"In this study, we extend the single vendor-buyer integrated inventory model to consider deterioration and carbon emission cost. The model extends previous studies by considering carbon emission from warehousing as well as transport activities and from the disposal of deteriorated items. The numerical example shows that in an integrated supply chain decision, the delivery frequency (n) is smaller and the delivery quantity (Q) is bigger when compared with the decision made solely from the buyer’s perspective. The integrated inventory model has significantly reduced the total cost and the total carbon emissions. It is also shown that by incorporating emission cost into the inventory model decreases the delivery frequency and increases the quantity. Incorporating carbon emission into the integrated inventory model will reduce the total carbon emissions and slightly reduce the total supply chain cost. Further research can be considered for different backordering situation and different emission control policies.

90,Bullwhip Effect Measures In A Non-Stationary Seasonal  Supply Chain,"the objective of this paper is to study the impact of seasonal demand parameters and the lead time of the retailer on the variables like order quantity, bullwhip effect and on-hand inventory to elaborate the supply chain dynamics. the objectives are achieved through analysis of a simple two echelon supply chain with retailer at the lower level and the supplier at the upper level. the time series of the end customer demand data exhibit a non-stationary sarima process. through expression of bullwhip effect we show an increase in their value due to the presence of seasonal effect and non-stationary in the end customer demand. our results show an increase in the variance of the expressions of both order quantity and on- hand inventory due to the presence of seasonality in the demand. further with an increase in the retailer’s lead time the bullwhip effect increases with a constant rate till the lead time crosses one season. as the lead time crosses one season, the slope suddenly increases. further when the value of seasonal moving average parameter changes from positive to negative value, the bullwhip effect decreases.","bullwhip effect, seasonal demand, ima process",,"cherian samuel department of mechanical engineering indian institute of technology (bhu) varanasi, india csamuel.mec@itbhu.ac.in narayan kumar faculty of mechanical engineering sri ramswroop memorial university lucknow, india narayan.kumar.mec13@itbhu.ac.in",
91,Selection Of Best Professional Institute In India: The Student  Perspective,"in recent past, selection of professional institute in india is becoming a strategic issue for a student to get higher education in professional courses. selection of the right institution should be based on multi- criteria decision-making methods for smart decisions. five to ten years back, the selection of the professional institutions was less strategic in the absence of ordinal data because of less number of professional institutes were in india. in this work, for selection of best professional institute among a large number of alternatives, we applied multi-criteria decision-making technique with a group of decision makers along with ordinal data of given alternatives. initially, we aggregated the ordinal data of different choices with each criterion from the binary programming tool. after that, we have the final rankings of various alternatives derived from their group rankings by binary programming along with the criteria weights. with an illustrative case of having five decision makers, five professional institutes and three criteria named as placement, infrastructure and faculty profile we have shown the effectiveness of this model.",mcdm,"Recently taking evaluation and selection of professional institute in India is one of the most critical activities for students.

92,How The Reverse Channel Strategy Is Affected By Epr  Policies And Asymmetric Information,"in the waste electrical and electronic equipment (weee) collection, the manufacturer can select reverse channel strategies between third-party-managed collection (model 3p) and retailer-managed collection (model r). however, he has to face up with collector’s collection cost information asymmetry (ia), and the implementation of extended producer responsibility (epr) policies. we first derive, in closed forms, the optimal contracts for model r and 3p, in joint consideration of epr and ia. meantime, we find complementary effect between ia and epr. our subsequent model comparison illustrates how to optimally select the mode of business, i.e. retailer collection or collection by 3rd party. the former is preferred if the manufacturer faces up with stricter epr policies. if the magnitude of ia is higher, the latter would be a better option, because third party collection is less sensitive to ia but more sensitive to the epr policies. moreover, the presence of ia boosts the retail price and lower the demand due to the decrease of collection rate, while the epr policies have just opposite effects on price and demand. hence, the price, demand and collection rate all depend on the comparison between the magnitude of ia and epr.","reverse logistics, epr policies","To investigate how to collect the used products in the reverse channel, this paper studies mode selection problems between 3P-managed collection (Model 3P) and retailer-managed collection (Model R) under both extended producer responsibility (EPR) policies and information asymmetry (IA). The main drivers for mode selection include: (i) EPR policies, which sets a minimum collection rate for the used product, and (ii) IA regarding the collection cost, in which the precise collection cost is not known by the manufacturer. More specifically, our model yields the following conclusions. First, information asymmetry would boost the retail price and lower the demand due to the decrease of collection rate, while the EPR policies have exactly inverse effects on price and demand with increasing collection rate. Hence, the price, demand and collection rate all depend on the comparison between the magnitude of IA and EPR. Specifically, if IA exceeds some critical level, retailer-managed collection is no longer preferred from the aspect of collection rate. Second, both IA and EPR help collectors cumulate higher information rent. Note that retailer’s information rent is always higher than that of 3P without the EPR policies. Meanwhile, both information rent can be identical under EPR policies. As such, the presence of EPR policies adds advantage to Model 3P. Third, on the contrary, from the manufacturer’s standpoint, if he faces up with stricter EPR policies, Model R is preferred; on the other hand, if he has to bear higher risk due to asymmetric information, 3P-managed collection should be a better option. This stems from the fact that 3P-managed collection is less sensitive to IA while being more sensitive to the EPR policies. Compared to Model 3P, Model R, when selected by the manufacturer, lowers the retail price and raises the demand. Finally, EPR policies and IA have complementary effect. Consequently, if the manufacturer faces up with a stricter EPR policy, he has to pick a more familiar collector, since lower magnitude of IA could save his more profit. Similarly, if the manufacturer is obliged to bear higher risk of information asymmetry, he has to seek for environments with weaker EPR policy for his business. Second, When IA scales up, it requires more EPR regulation for a manufacturer to switch to retailer-managed collection mode. When the EPR policy becomes tougher, the critical level of IA that shifts the business mode from retailer-managed to 3P-managed collection becomes increased Three extensions to our research are worth investigation. First, the manufacturer can utilize the newly emerged collective producer responsibility (CPR) to support its collectors. Second, another extension could consider different cost settings (for example, 3P-managed collection has a cost advantage to retailer collection), or different proximity to the consumer (for example, retailer has more knowledge of the end market). At last, apart from the profits of supply chain entities (information rent and manufacturer’s profit), the environmental impact (e.g. measured by carbon emission) caused by the two business modes (namely, retailer collection and 3rd party collection) can also be studied in contrast.

94,Sustainable City Logistics Through Shared Resource  Concepts,"the global trend of urbanization has important consequences on society and the environment in urban areas. growing population, scarcity of resources and rising freight transport in urban areas result in completely overloaded infrastructures. the ""last-mile"" delivery in the city is considered to be particularly complex and occurs in most cases not comprehensively structured. the consequences are far-reaching environmental problems, noise pollution and a general reduction in the quality of life in the city. therefore, in the field of urban logistics is a great potential for optimization. the subject of this article is a logistics shared-resources approach for a structured, organized and bundled supply in urban areas.","sustainability, city logistics","and outlook The global megatrend of urbanization is advancing persistently. The consequences of the strong increase of population in urban areas are manifold, and especially the steeply rising traffic volume is a major problem. First and foremost, the quality of life of urban residents suffers from these problems. The currently chaotic situation of urban supply and disposal should be regarded as an opportunity for the development of urban logistics. Various constraints and the enormous variety of influencing factors and actors make the logistic planning on the ""last mile"" a complex undertaking. The focus is usually not on the overall system ""city"". The prerequisite for the implementation of the presented structural forms is the fulfillment of sustainability in all its three dimensions. The efficiency of the shared resource approach is positively influenced by scale effects, better utilization of the means of transport and better coordination of the flow of goods. In addition to a reduction in the consumption of resources as well as transport costs, the quality of life for residents in the city should also increase. In the future, the planning of urban logistics will play a key role in urban development in order to combine goals such as economic growth, environmental protection and quality of life. We will look at the entire system, which requires close cooperation between the parties involved. The development of society, increased energy costs, stricter environmental conditions and the growing spread of innovative information and communication technology will contribute to the city's improvement in all areas.","patrick dallasega, thomas stecher, erwin rauch and dominik t. matt industrial automation and engineering (iea) faculty of science and technology free university of bolzano 39100 bolzano, italy patrick.dallasega@unibz.it, thomas.stecher@natec.unibz.it, erwin.rauch@unibz.it, dominik.matt@unibz.it dominik t. matt fraunhofer italia research s.c.a.r.l. innovation engineering center (iec) free university of bolzano 39100 bolzano, italy dominik.matt@fraunhofer.it",

It is obvious that consumers would have to look for evidence of the quality in means other than the physical inspection of the goods on offer to gain trust. In this aspect, perceived risk as e-commerce barrier is given particular attention. E-commerce Performance Indicators consist of 3 constructs: competence, integrity, and benevolence and there are 9 indicators for measuring those constructs; 3 indicators to measure competence constructs, 3 indicators to measure integrity contructs, and 3 indicators to measure benevolence constructs. For future research suggestion, the model should be tested empirically in case study. The empirical can be done by spreading the questionnaire to customer ask factors within the model and relate the construction through SEM analysis.

102,Supply Chain Coordination With Contracts Under Bilateral  Asymmetric Information,"this paper investigates coordination in a supply chain with contracts under bilateral asymmetric information. we study wholesale price, buy-back, revenue share, quantity discount and quantity flexibility contracts. addressing how to allocate the total supply chain profit between retailer and supplier according to their advantages of information, we establish the bridge, transfer payment scheme, connecting the centralized solution and decentralized solution. in particular, all contracts are shown to coordinate the supply chain under bilateral asymmetric information except the wholesale price contract. results are illustrated with numerical examples.",,"To improve the coordination between the supplier and the retailer, there are increasing interests in examining various types of supply chain contracts to achieve channel coordination as well as win–win situations for each partner of the chain. Since contracts based on a single policy, e.g. returns, quantity discounts, revenue sharing, rebates, fail to coordinate the chain, scholars attempt several approach. Beyond question, it is a better method to consider the composite contracts. Varying the setting is another good choice. On the one hand, modifying the supplier-retailer models could be considered, e.g. multiple suppliers single retailer, single supplier multiple retailers, even multiple suppliers multiple retailers. Actually, this is effective. On the other hand, information structure could also be altered, 0 5 10 15 0 50 100 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 cost demand forecast 659","yang liu department of industrial engineering tsinghua university beijing, china lyncepu0612@163.com yang zhang department of industrial engineering tsinghua university beijing, china yangzhanguser@tsinghua.edu.cn","References

103,A Model For Turnaround Maintenance Planning For A  Network Of Plants,"turnaround maintenance (tam) is a periodic event in which a plant is shutdown to perform inspections, repairs, replacements and overhauls to ensure plant reliability, availability and performance. this is practiced in many industries including petrochemical industries, refineries, power plants and chemical processing industries. tam is a major event that is repeated every five to seven and takes away long time of production stoppage and high costs of material and workforce. in some industries it may take months of work and millions of dollars. it needs long time of planning and preparation to maintain a minimum level of efficiency and effectiveness. research in tam is mainly focused on planning of a single plant and rarely deals with network of plants within or across business units. however, in the era of globalization supply chains became a matter of business survival. this brings the issue of tam planning and scheduling across supply chains to the top of research needs. in this paper a mathematical programming model for scheduling tam activities within the supply chain is presented. the model incorporates realistic constraints such as the availability of internal and external manpower and material supplies, product demand, production capacity and inventory capacity of all units involved. the developed model is solved using gams model builder and cplex solver. the utilization of the model is demonstrated on a realistic example from process industry.","turn around, maintenance, scheduling, dhahran",,"umar al-turki, salih duffuaa and mohamed idris systems engineering department king fahd university of petroleum and minerals dhahran, saudi arabia alturki@kfupm.edu.sa, dufuaa@kfupm.edu.sa, mohamed.m.m.idris@gmail.com",

105,Evaluating Maintenance Policy And Implementation  Strategies To Improve Building Functional Performance In,"several government’s building in jakarta are in bad conditions. maintenance policies have been made by the government in an effort to keep the performance of the building remain good. in implementing the policies that have been made, appropriate strategies are needed to enable the policy to proceed as planned. although the budget was increased for maintenance activities, the implementation didn’t go well as planned in government’s building. this study aims to improve building functional performance by evaluating the maintenance policy and strategic implementation. several method were adopted to identify policy, strategy and the factors of functional performance which affected through questionnaire survey and delphi technique. the results should show that maintenance performance could be improved by evaluating the maintenance policy and its strategic implementation. the originality of this research could identify the factors in maintenance policies and strategies, which affect the functional performance of government buildings that necessary including security and environmental aspects which is not included in past research.","evaluate, policy, strategy, maintenance",,"government building: a case study in jakarta, indonesia fahry adam department of civil engineering universitas indonesia depok, indonesia fahryadam@gmail.com yusuf latief department of civil engineering universitas indonesia depok, indonesia latief73@eng.ui.ac.id","references to be associated with function eligibility. 
Based on statistical analysis, the most dominant factor or influence the functional function of government 
building is planning and development policy, implementation policy and information and system policy. This is also 
supported by the results of analysis on PLS-SEM model. All the factors obtained require policies in order to implement 
appropriate strategies for the feasibility of building functions. So it is important that factors related to it can be 
controlled and monitored as consideration determines the maintenance policy. For the government policy that doesn’t 
exist as indicator shown before, it is recommend to create a policy based of these indicator. 
Based on the results of the identification of the maintenance policies studied have significant effect but not 
on all aspects of functionality, such as environment and amenity. The aspects of functionality that are significantly 
related to the policy studied are aspects of safety, health, security and comfort.

106,Culture And Consumer Brand Switching: Moderating Role  Of Consumer Involvement And Service Value,"culture of a society is considered to be one of the influencing factors for a consumer when switching a brand of a product. it not only shapes the underlying behavior but also influences the perception of a consumer in decision making. since behavior of a consumer would be effected his/her inherent cultural values which in turn would rely on culture of its society he/she is a part of, it’s important to study it in consumer switching context. previous studies linking this phenomenon with culture has mostly found to be focusing on cross- cultural references, using variety, novelty, curiosity and vanity-seeking behavior of consumer. but there is hardly any study using cultural as a construct for consumer switching taking primarily in account different dimensions of culture. our research is one such attempt to explore consumer brand switching using cultural dimensions given by hofstede. effect of culture on consumer switching is explored using hofstede’s six-cultural dimensions taking into account different levels of involvement (high, medium and low) of consumer and value of product as moderators. as depending on involvement of consumer, the cost in terms of time and effort invested for purchase, switching is going to differ, effecting satisfaction and loyalty construct. similarly, when it comes to value of product the switching levels might differ for a cost-effective and premium category product.","consumer switching, culture, involvement","& DISCUSSION In this paper through literature review, we have identified that societal culture affects consumer Switching Behavior. It is also proposed that CSB would vary depending on the level of involvement and value of a service, which acts as a moderator between cultural antecedents of a society and Switching Behavior. And hence, it is concluded that different market strategies can be developed by marketing firms and consumer business’ to tackle cultural differences of global consumers on these pre-defined Cultural dimensions to discourage switching, on different levels of consumer involvement for different types of Services depending on value-offering. We give a theoretical framework here and will get back after we are done with data collection and results. The proposed hypotheses will be verified through empirical data in the next version.","anjali sharma dept. of industrial & management eng. indian institute of technology-kanpur, u.p. -208016, india anjalish@iitk.ac.in r.r.k. sharma dept. of industrial & management eng. indian institute of technology-kanpur, u.p. -208016, india rrks@iitk.ac.in",

108,Modeling Of Multimodal Transportation Problem  Considering Carbon Emission,"the effects of global warming are threatening the earth's ecosystem sustainability. countries and companies need to get appropriate measures to maintain sustainability. one of the joint commitments made is about carbon emissions reductions. practically, this commitment defines a different capacity of carbon limit for each country or company. firms are expected to find the best solution to reduce the amount of carbon emissions while minimizing the total cost, including by optimizing transportation. this research is about modeling the combination of multimodal land transportation (truck and rail) from the origin (supplier) to the destination (manufacturer) with considering carbon emission emitted. our objective is to find a tradeoff between transportation costs and emissions. we show how the parameters associated with carbon emissions affect transportation cost from the supplier to the manufacturer. the method used in this article is mixed integer linear programming.",surabaya,,"thina ardliana shipbuilding institute of polytechnic surabaya doctoral student at industrial engineering department sepuluh nopember institute of technology surabaya, indonesia ardlianathina@gmail.com i nyoman pujawan and nurhadi siswanto industrial engineering department sepuluh nopember institute of technology surabaya, indonesia pujawan@gmail.com, siswanto@ie.its.ac.id",
109,Development Of Building Information Modelling (Bim)  Model To Enhance Services In Maintenance Of Public,"maintenance of a building has a purpose to preserve the building in accordance with the initial conditions on functional, structural, and aesthetic. in addition, maintenance aspects cover a long life cycle in a building, thusq maintenance costs tend to be larger than other construction phases. dpr ri building is one of the government buildings owned by the state which also can not be separated from maintenance and financing aspect. building information modeling (bim) is a system and tools approach used in the aspects of building maintenance. the purpose of this research is to identify factors that influence the development of bim-models and how to develop bim-models to improve services in building maintenance. the research was conducted by validating the content to the experts of building maintenance and bim to find out the influencing factors and further develop the bim-model by taking of historical data and field survey. from the data then conducted an qualitative analysis based on the influencing factors. from this research, it is found that influential factor in bim-model development that improve service in maintenance of government building and found steps that can be done to enhance service in maintenance at government building by using building information modeling.",services,"and Recommendation The first objective of this research is to identify factors that influence the development of BIM-model to improve service on maintenance of government buildings. So it can be concluded from all the important factors of BIM, which have been validated by previous experts, that several factors of BIM are very influential on the economic aspects, technical aspects and social aspects of maintenance. While in environmental aspect of maintenance has percentage of influence equal to 73%, slightly lower than other aspects. Each influential factor can be seen in Table 2 with details as follows: • 12 BIM factors that affect the economic aspects • 15 BIM factors that affect the technical aspects • 10 BIM factors that affect the social aspect • 5 BIM factors that affect the environmental aspects The conclusions can be obtained from the case study that the development of BIM-models to enhance service on maintenance of Government buildings is very new in Indonesia, although the use of BIM in other countries has been well developed. Until now the use of BIM in Indonesia is still done in several pilot projects at the stage of construction implementation, but has not entered the stage of maintenance yet. Since BIM is still relatively new in Indonesia, so much still needs to be prepared in the future, both from the internal manager of the Government building itself and from external involving the support of Government and other parties. The first step that can be done to develop BIM-model in Government building is by preparing criteria through several stages in order to improve service on maintenance of Government building. The stages are to know and determine the criteria of the BIM function, determine the necessary information criteria, determine the technical criteria related to the BIM implementation and determine the appropriate organizational and legal criteria to support the BIM functions. From the research results of BIM-model development to enhance service on maintenance of Government buildings, the suggested suggestions are as follows: 1. In further research it is necessary to know the right information system used in Government building to support BIM-model development 2. The constraints put forward by the authors are expected to be input or important note for further research related to maintenance of government buildings. 3208",building ulfa fatmasari magister program student of project management department of civil engineering universitas indonesia ulfatmasari@gmail.com yusuf latief professor department of civil engineering universitas indonesia yusuflatief73@gmail.com,"References

During solution construction, the ants make the best possible choice, as indicated by the pheromone trail and heuristic information. The performance of the proposed ant system has been tested on sets of well-known benchmark problems. The Computational results show that the algorithm is capable of solving the small problems optimally, and gives good performance for large scale ones and has achieved optimality by 70.4%, 27.8% for 2LBP and 2LSP problems, respectively. Also, total averages percentage deviation comparing with the optimal solution are 3.52%, 2.35% for the 2LBP and 2LSP problems, respectively. More work could be carried out to optimize the algorithm parameters and to find more effective local search method in order to obtain better results for large size problems.

112,Conceptual Framework To Develop E-Maintenance  Of Government Building Based On Bim,"government building is one of the state assets that requires effective and efficient maintenance management, to extend the life of the building and to optimize its utilization or function. irrelevant government building maintenance strategies not only cause losses to the state but also harm building users. many studies have shown that improper maintenance management has caused harm to residents or users of the building. as a state asset, government buildings have a very strategic and urgent function for the benefit of public services. while the maintenance tends to be still conventional, whereas the development of technology brings many benefits in building maintenance management. the concept that is widely applied today to building management is to integrate the concept of bim and e-maintenance. these two concepts are considered to result in effective and efficient maintenance. e-maintenance is an important breakthrough for government building maintenance so that the entire maintenance process can be monitored through the system. this study aims to identify the conceptual framework that will be used for the development of the bim-based government building e-maintenance system. this study is expected to generate a conceptual framework for the development of e-maintenance of government buildings based on bim.","e-maintenance, bim",,"anita handayaniputri1 and yusuf latief2 1phd student department of civil engineering faculty of engineering universitas indonesia, jakarta indonesia putrinit@gmail.com 2profesor department of civil engineering faculty of engineering universitas indonesia, jakarta indonesia",

114,Ergonomics-Based Kansei Engineering And Kano Model For  Public Services Excellence,"emotion is found to be stronger than cognition in human and system interaction. kansei engineering has been extensively used to capture customer emotions and translate them into product characteristics since 1980s. ergonomics in kansei engineering is dealing with user and customer capability and limitation in terms of emotional aspects. customer emotion and expression resulted from both products and services interaction. however, research of kansei engineering in services is still relatively less explored. since service industries are growing significantly as one of the contributors for today’s economy, it is a calling for ergonomics-based kansei engineering methodology in understanding, modeling and fulfilling what the emotional needs as a function of service attributes. in this study, kano model has been proposed to kansei engineering methodology as a quality tool in screening which service attributes are sensitive to emotional satisfaction, so that more focused-improvements on services are highly expected. public service sector has been chosen as an empirical study to verify the proposed model. an interview followed by face to face questionnaire which involved 100 subjects has been conducted to explore and investigate what the critical emotional needs related to service attributes in the public service sector. the findings were deemed to be important for local government in prioritizing which services need to be improved. more importantly, it is hoped that both parties (i.e., public and local government) will experience the public service offerings in more effective and efficient way.","kansei engineering, kano model, ergonomics","and Further Research This study provides both theoretical and practical contributions. This study complements the applied integrated approach of Kansei Engineering and Kano to services, taking into account public services. The finding demonstrates how emotions were influenced by the usefulness and fulfillment of public service attributes. Apart from commercial-oriented services, this study was able to show that emotions are also important in bringing customer satisfaction regardless the type of business model. In addition, in-line with the previous studies on commercial services, this study provides a practical guideline for the local government or its representative in prioritizing which service attributes need to be improved given a limited budget and resource. 6.

115,The Development Of Risk-Based Standardized Wbs (Work  Breakdown Structure) For Cost Estimation Of Concrete,"the proper work breakdown structure (wbs) is very important in project planning so that deliverables and project work can be broken down into smaller components, more easily to construct and costs can be better controlled. construction of concrete precast bridges is the dominant type of bridge construction used in indonesia because it provides many advantages over the other types of construction. although the project is unique, the works on the construction of precast bridges and their elements are relatively similar, so they can be standardized and used as a basis for project control. this study aims to create wbs precast bridge construction standards and identify risk variables on the work packages, activities and resources on the construction of concrete precast bridges for improved project cost performance. this study provides results that the wbs standard of concrete precast bridge construction consists of 6 levels, with 13 dominant risk variables and 5 risk response recommendation groups against project cost estimates as the development of wbs standards.","wbs, precast bridge, risk","The result of standardized WBS of Precast Bridge Construction consists of 6 (six) levels i.e. 4 primary levels (project name, work section, sub work section, work package) and 2 complementary levels (work activity and resources). Alternative of work methods become the shape of work activity and resources breakdown. The identification of risk variables from WBS precast bridge construction yield 31 risk variables with 7 risk categories and produce 13 highest risk variables which influence of project cost performance. The identification of risk responds yield 22 preventive action, 21 corrective action and 14 risks respond as the development recommendation of standardized WBS. The development of standardized WBS grouped into 5 different categories and the application becomes project executor decision which is heavily influenced by corporate policy such as the organizational strategy, financial accounting policy, or project conditions. Risk-based standardized WBS of Precast Bridge Construction can be utilized for cost estimation, helping project executor identifies project works to the smallest items and setting cost objective for each item in greater accuracy as a tool to ensure every work has considered the requirements to respond cost- related risks. 738","precast bridge construction remi fitriadi kurnia1, yusuf latief1, and leni sagita riantini1 department of civil engineering university of indonesia depok 16424, indonesia remifitriadi@gmail.com, yusuflatief73@gmail.com, leniarif@gmail.com","References

116,Optimisation Nozzle Design For Mixing Fluid Using  Computational Fluid Dynamics,"the mixing of different chemicals has traditionally been achieved using a rotating paddle in a tank. an alternate option to mix chemicals together is using jet nozzles to spray them into the tank. this paper presents different setups that could be potentially used for selected tank and find the optimal design. the aspects that are changed in the report where the inlet pipe location, the outlet pipe location and the inlet fluid speed. by using solidworks to create the models and star ccm+ to run the simulations, the results of each test where generated and analysed. the validation had been conducted prior to the simulation. when analysing the results, the primary area of interest was the location and size of any dead zones that occurred in the tank during the running of the simulation. the results show that the optimal design for this tank is a side entry inlet pipe at the top of the tank with a side exit outlet pipe at the bottom of the tank, perpendicular to the inlet pipe. it was also shown that a slower inlet speed improved the quality of the mixing process.","mixing fluid, jet nozzle, cfd, solidworks",,"thomas chenery beng (hons) mechanical engineering university of derby derby, de22 3aw, united kingdom t.chenery1@unimail.derby.ac.uk dr. dani harmanto research for advanced design and simulation university of derby derby, de22 3aw, united kingdom d.harmanto@derby.ac.uk",
117,A Conceptual Framework For Combining Artificial Neural  Networks With Computational Aeroacoustics For Design,"this paper presents a preliminary method for improving the design and development process in a way that combines engineering design approaches based on learning algorithms and computational aeroacoustics. it is proposed that machine learning can effectively predict the noise generated by a coaxial jet exhaust by utilizing a database of computational experiments that cover a variety of flow and geometric configurations. a conceptual framework has been outlined for the development of a practical design tool to predict the changes in jet acoustics imparted by varying the fan nozzle geometry and engine cycle of a coaxial jet. it is proposed that computational aeroacoustic analysis is used to generate a training and validation database for an artificial neural network. the trained network can then predict noise data for any operational configuration. this method allows for the exploration of noise emissions from a variety of fan nozzle areas, engine cycles and flight conditions. it is intended that this be used as a design tool in order to reduce the design cycle time of new engine configurations and provide engineers with insight into the relationship between jet noise and the input variables.",2015),"This paper has described the conceptual framework for a CAA-ANN based design tool for the development of a VAFN-VCE with respect to noise and operation. CAA and ANN methods have been integrated to provide a model suitable for predicting noise from a variety of flow configurations of industrial interest. It is proposed that this model provide insight to industry through an enhanced understanding of the noise producing mechanisms of VAFN-VCE for subsonic jets and show how performance improvements can be maximized through the use of an ANN trained with a database generated using CAA methods. The usefulness of this as a design tool can be determined through the accuracy of the ANN results and the time taken to provide a result. Now that the framework has been proposed, future work will continue to expand the concept of combining artificial neural networks and computational aeroacoustics in order to validate this methodology.","development claire mckee, dani harmanto and amanda whitbrook school of engineering and technology university of derby kedleston road, derby, de22 1gb, uk. c.e.mckee@outlook.com, d.harmanto@derby.ac.uk, a.whitbrook@derby.ac.uk",
118,Market Mavens In The E-World  R.R.K. Sharma,the aim of the paper is to clarify the concept of market mavens in the age of e-commerce/brick and click retail. the paper also discusses about the alternatives for market mavens for current scenario. paper also highlights the importance of various factors responsible for behavior of market mavens. papers also present the way market mavens has evolved over time and its changing role according to the society.,"e-commerce, market maven, opinion leaders","that: H4: E-mavens will be younger than Market Mavens. Since various products have varying prices and features, the involved processes and complexity in decision making process vary as per the product. There are two kinds of products as far as we concern decision making process. a) Low involvement product: Product that is properly under budget and doesn’t involve high amount of thinking and cognition. A little risk is associated in purchase of these products. b) High involvement product: Product that are high in price and involve high amount of thinking, cognition and advice. These products incur high risks as having a worse product may cost a huge loss. Market Maven tend to have influence mostly on low involvement products (Puspa and Rahardja, 2009). The reason being that these involve minimal risks and therefore consumers are willing to try a new brand or follow an advice. But in case of high involvement products, people generally don’t prefer to try out new products unless they are highly influenced by opinion leader (Clark and Goldsmith, 2006). They tend to rely upon their cognitive and past experiences to review brand and service superiority to ensure a perfect purchase and no risk. For example, while buying a mobile phone, people generally get influenced by Market Mavens and give a thought to a purchase of new brand, but, in case of purchasing of cars, people still tend to trust the experiences of their relatives, past users etc. rather than trusting on some Maven. People tend to reject new brands when it comes to high involvement product purchase even if they are providing better purchases. This brings us to the following hypothesis: - H5: E-mavens in the e-world have influential role only in low involvement products. In today’s era, where the world is getting transferred to a high-tech lifestyle, everything has started to be mechanized and automatic. Internet itself has played a vital for proliferation of the same. As earlier in this paper, we discussed about websites like shopclues.com, gadgets.ndtv.com etc., these include specifications of various electronic products specifically. They contain the content like consumers’ reviews, star rating, marks out of 100% etc. Also, in a recent study, Ian Brodie, on his website, www.ianbrodie.com , posted the way to get good star ratings on Google search results. He explained how it is obvious to get a good click rate on the link that has higher rating and is appealing to internet surfers to help reducing the doubt in authenticity of the website. Also, a sufficiently large amount of population can ow access platform like YouTube etc. which is the reason for emerging of very famous market mavens like Technical Guruji and Geeky Ranjit. If it wasn’t for these platforms, many knowledgeful Mavens couldn’t have risen themselves. Observing it’s increment to occur at very fast pace, we can propose a hypothesis that: H6: In the e-world several websites would serve the job for e-mavens. In the above readings, while we have talked about the ways consumers are benefitted with the help of proliferation of internet which has led to the formation of e-mavens, there are certain drawbacks that comes with this boon. Websites now-a-days provide very keen comparison between every set of products. While consumers are highly benefitted from these product specification representations and are able to pursue based on its pros and cons, but at the same time, the availability of many choices leads to more and more confusion which leads to high uncertainty in the product purchasing behavior. Because of this, consumer even try to ruthlessly compare those features, which are not of his use. For example, in early days, for purchasing phone, the basic necessities were limited to calling, voice quality, music. But in todays advanced world, the necessities have gone freakishly high which may not be useful for some person, but is taken into consideration just because one phone has it and another doesn’t. Thus, we can conclude for following hypothesis: H7: In the E-world, the consumer will experience more uncertainty. 8. Conclusion In this paper, we explored the current scenario of Market Maven in the age of e-commerce, as how it is different from a physical market maven. The concept of e-retail and role of Market Maven in it was entertained in this paper. Types of Market Mavens and its alternatives along with its flaws were also explored. We observed that there has 754","sanjay mittal chair professor (hag scale) department of industrial management and engineering indian institute of technology kanpur kanpur, u.p., india rrks@iitk.ac.in vinayak drave department of industrial management and engineering indian institute of technology kanpur kanpur, u.p., india vinayak@iitk.ac.in tushar mangal department of civil engineering indian institute of technology kanpur kanpur, u.p., india mtushar@iitk.ac.in","References

Through extensive review of literature, it is suggested that the Virtual Teams of Prospector organizations who are Innovator in nature will have rich ICT (Information and Communication Technologies) in their operations which allows VTs implementation.The study proposes that ST type of participants will be dominant in the firms with Cost leader strategies and it is also evident that the Differentiators in a supply chain depicts high uncertainty along with an extrovert (perspective) behavior which presents an advantageous position for the consumer with reducing inclination towards substitutes. On the other hand, Cost Leader types of organization are more introverts (judgmental)These parameters will be further proved and verified through empirical data. This study holds good potential for accessing and building up a background for literature on implementation of Virtual Teams in different types organization, structure and able use of ICT. In this research we have pointed out the following hypothesis which will be empirically tested for further confirmation of theory. 6.

125,Impact Of Order Picking Regions On The Performance Of  Routing Picking Policies,order picking is the most labor-intensive and costly activity for almost every warehouse. the problem of order picking routing in a warehouse is mainly solved using heuristics. the objective of this paper is investigating the impact of order picking regions on the performance of four order-picking routing heuristics. a proposed warehouse is divided to twelve main regions and large numbers of randomly test problems are generated. the computational results show that the order region has significance impact on the performance of the routing heuristics.,warehouse,"In this paper we investigate the impact of order region on the performance of four routing heuristics, S-shape, Return, Mid-point, and Largest gap. Four experiments are designed based on proposed rectangular warehouse consists of 12 regions and single depot located at the lower left corner. Large numbers of test problems are generated uniformly from the regions under study. The computational results reveal the following findings: (1) if the orders are distributed in the whole warehouse the largest gap is the best when order size less than 4% otherwise S-shape is the best, these findings are valid if the warehouse is divided vertically. (2) Dividing the warehouse into two horizontal halves shows that the performance of Midpoint and Largest gap are the best in the upper half, and on the other hand the Return and Midpoint are the best in the lower half.

The second research objective generates 9 dominant risks towards safety performance after qualitative risk analysis, the highest risk score obtained from the category of design or method. The third research objective shows that not every risk responses can be adopted directly into related WBS structure. There are 5 different categories and the application becomes project executor decision which is heavily influenced by corporate policy such as the organizational strategy, financial accounting policy, or project conditions (eg. how large the risk response will affect the project cost). Risk-based standardized WBS can be utilized for the basis of safety planning, helping project executor identifies project works to the smallest items and setting safety performance for each items in greater accuracy as a tool to ensure every work has considered the requirements to respond safety-related risks.","bridge project gilang satrio department of civil engineering university of indonesia depok, jawa barat, indonesia giohitam@yahoo.com, gil.satrio@gmail.com prof. dr. ir. yusuf latief, mt. department of civil engineering university of indonesia depok, jawa barat, indonesia yusuflatief73@gmail.com",

139,Analysis Of The Operations Management Strategy Of A  Telecommunication Company In Malaysia,"the transformation of telecommunication industry in malaysia has seen dramatic changes in the last decade. this industry provides high speed data, voice services, graphics, television, and video at increasing speeds and through diversity of channels. while fixed-line telephonic communication is still the core service mode, wireless communication, internet, cable and satellite program distribution are improving their share in the overall industry earnings.to sustain productively in this industry, operations strategy and critical decisions are important aspects of operations management. this paper reports the analysis on the operations management strategies of a telecommunication company (named tc) in malaysia. the current challenges that play an important part in deriving and developing effective operations strategies to be in line with the mission and vision of the organization are identified. analyses on the company’s strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (swot) and the factors affecting the company mission provide the necessary information in helping the company management to make critical decisions in developing its operations management strategies. the final section discusses the global operations management mission and strategy that would be additional values.",mission,"The telecommunication company must continuously monitor and evaluate its challenges and SWOT. This could be achieved by identifying the detail changes in the current telecommunication marker, even those subtle ones. For instance, if a company’s product is receiving small patronage, then perhaps it's time to introduce or vary the product based on customer needs and satisfaction. These will provide critical inputs in designing the company’s competitive advantage strategies. Critical decisions for TC include those related to fast changing telecommunication technology, and consumer needs. Thus, it is essential that for Telecommunication company (TC) to remain competitive in the telecommunication market it must continually re-define and re-invent the company’s strategies. Differentiation strategy would be best for TC to adopt.

148,A Mathematical Model For Outbound Truck Scheduling  With Multiple Trips In Multi-Door Cross Docking System,"this paper presents the novel mathematical model which considered the outbound scheduling problem in the multi-door cross docking system. the proposed model is different from other truck scheduling models due to the characteristic of the outbound trucks in which each outbound truck can make multiple trips to deliver products to different sets of customers. in addition, it is desired that outbound trucks leave the dock doors as close to their predetermined due time to ensure customer satisfaction. to determine optimal solutions for this problem, the problem is formulated as a mixed integer programming (mip) model. the objectives are to minimize the total tardiness and the total earliness of all outbound trucks. the model is solved using the exact method of lingo programming solver. the experimental results are executed in two phases. first, the optimal truck schedules are obtained by optimizing two objectives separately. then, the multi-objective approach is used to find a set of solutions so that the decision makers can make a decision based on their preferences. the numerical results illustrate that, the model can only find optimal solutions for the small-size problems, however; it could not find optimal solutions for the large size problems within reasonable time.","truck scheduling, outbound truck, total earliness","This paper considers the scheduling problem of outbound trucks in the multi-door cross docking system. Each outbound truck can make multiple trips to deliver products to different sets of customers. In addition, it is desired that outbound trucks leave the dock doors as close as their predetermined due time to ensure customer satisfaction. To determine optimal solutions for this problem, the outbound truck scheduling is formulated as a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) model. The objective of the model is to minimize the total tardiness and the total earliness of all outbound trucks. The model is solved using the exact method of LINGO programming solver. The experimental results are executed in two phases. First, the optimal truck schedules are obtained by optimizing two objectives separately. Then, in the second phase, the multi-objective approach based on the weighed sum method is used in order to find a set of solutions according to the different combination of objective weights. Therefore, the decision makers can make a decision based on their preferences. Since the problem is NP-Hard, the numerical results illustrate that the proposed mathematical model is able to find optimal solutions only for the small-size problems. However; it cannot find optimal solutions for the large size problems within reasonable time. The further works include the improvement of the mathematical model to take into account of more complex constraints to represent real-world practices. Moreover, for highly complicated problems consisting of many trucks and many doors, other solution tools such as heuristic and meta-heuristic models could be used instead.","nattapong kamsura and warisa wisittipanich department of industrial engineering faculty of engineering, chiang mai university chiang mai 50200, thailand kamsura01@gmail.com, warisa.o@gmail.com",

150,Impact Of Capacity Loss Factors In Front-Of-Line Ic Packaging  On Production Performance: A Case Study,"attributed to the rapidly maturing and evolving application of electronics packaging, efficient packaging processes are crucial in ensuring high quality and reliability of products. one of the elements in efficient packaging processes is the minimization of capacity losses. most of the devices are patterned onto wafers, specifically for the front of line integrated circuit (ic) packaging. in this area, various capacity loss factors need to be correctly identified and integrated into production planning to prevent low fill rate, expansion of lead time and work-in process (wip) build-up. this research is based on a case study; wherein potential capacity loss factors of a chosen front-of-line production are investigated to identify their impact on production performance. mathematical models of various factors are integrated into the simulation model of the current production. the performance measure data are then collected and analysed, thus determining the significant capacity loss factors. it was found that cycle time, setup time, yield loss and machine downtime are significant capacity loss factors in front section of line packaging.","capacity loss, cycle time, yield loss","Level of Significance Make Span Reduction of 5% on setup time 0.0542 Insignificant - Reduction of 10% on setup time 1.0577 Insignificant - Reduction of 20% on setup time 0.4899 Insignificant - Reduction of 30% on setup time 4.3759 Significant 0.01 Tstat 0.99 (4,20) = 3.08 and Tstat 0.95(4,20) = 2.30 Experiment 5: Analysis of work-in-progress (WIP) loss factors significancy on the performance measures From Table 9, the analysis indicates that three Ftest values are less than Fcrit. The null hypotheses are accepted for all three performance measures which are no significant effect on average flow time, throughput rate and make span. Thus, no Dunnett Test is carried out since WIP is not a significant loss factor. Table 9: Summarized table for test of significant on Experiment 5 Performance Measures F-Test Value Conclusion Level of Significance Average flow time 0.29 Insignificant - Throughput rate 0.26 Insignificant - Make span 0.09 Insignificant - Fcrit 0.99 (4,20) = 4.43 and Fcrit 0.95(4,20) = 2.87 3.1 Discussion Reduction of cycle time is vital to retain capacity yield in the industry. Based on the mathematical model of cycle time (Eqn. (1)), it is proven that the processing cycle time and batch quantity affect the cycle time in progress. Practitioners are advised to reduce the batch quantity in order to diminish the effect of capacity loss. Yield loss in the production line is controlled on 2% in overall production. 2% defect variety is a restricted yield loss limit. Therefore, it can be said that the reduction of yield loss factor only plays a minor role in capacity loss reduction. The yield loss factor only significance on the total production measures, i.e. make span. In the Dunnett Test, only 20% and 30% reduction of machine downtime show significant comparison with the control group. Hence, large reduction on machine downtime can be translated to better production yield. Practitioners can increase the mean time between failures, or reduce the mean time for repair, thus increasing the machine availability and reducing machine downtime. Setup time has limited effect on the average flow time and throughput rate. Despite the situation, setup time influences the total production, such as make span of product in the production line. In the Dunnett Test analysis, only a large percentage of reduction on setup time has significant effect on the performance measures. This occurrence is due to the setup time is less than the operation cycle time. Hence, the small percentage of setup time does not affect the overall productivity of the organization. In the examination of WIP significance, the low Ftest value indicates that there is sampling variation in the experiment. In other words, WIP is not a significant capacity loss factor that may lead to productivity constraint in the front of line in IC packaging industry. 917","lee hsuen yen school of mechanical engineering, universiti sains malaysia engineering campus, 14300 nibong tebal, pulau pinang, malaysia hsuenyen@yahoo.com shahrul kamaruddin mechanical engineering department, universiti teknologi petronas, bandar seri iskandar, 36210, perak, malaysia shahrul.k@utp.edu.my zulhilmi paiz ismadi school of engineering, monash university malaysia, jalan lagoon selatan,47500 bandar sunway, selangor darul ehsan, malaysia mohd.zulhilmi@monash.edu joshua prakash faculty of engineering and green technology, universiti tunku abdul rahman, perak campus, jalan universiti, bandar barat, 31900, kampar, perak joshuaj@utar.edu.my nik mizamzul mehat faculty of engineering technology, universiti malaysia perlis (unimap), aras 1, blok s2, kampus uniciti alam, sungai chuchuh, padang besar 02100, perlis, malaysia nikmizamzul@unimap.edu.my","References

151,Prediction Of Relative Permeability From Resistivity Index  And Capillary Pressure Data,"relative permeability data are used to predict the most effective hydrocarbon displacement mechanisms in a reservoir and how to deplete most of the oil or gas out of the reservoir as quickly and cheaply as possible. determination of capillary pressure and relative permeability are traditionally conducted in laboratory. however it is expensive, difficult, and time-consuming to measure capillary pressure and relative permeability in many cases. models representing such relationships show that capillary pressure and relative permeability could be inferred from resistivity data using analytical mathematical models derived theoretically. in fact two parameters out three (capillary pressure, relative permeability or resistivity) could be inferred using these models if only one of the parameters is known. in this paper, laboratory measurements of resistivity index, capillary pressure with different techniques, and relative permeability were conducted on samples from two fields representing libyan sandstone and carbonate reservoirs in order to review analytical mathematical models correlating resistivity index, capillary pressure and relative permeability. the results of relative permeability calculated using these models are analyzed and compared with data obtained from laboratory experiments. this paper shows that the three flow distribution functions, resistivity index, capillary pressure and relative permeability and also shows that relative permeability can be calculated from experimental data of both resistivity index and capillary pressure. good matching between relative permeabilities calculated from models and with experimental data.","capillary pressure, models, capillary pressure","The following conclusions may be drawn according to the present study:  The three saturation functions, resistivity index, capillary pressure and relative permeability, are coupled and can be inferred from each other using mathematical models described in this paper if one of the three parameters is known.  Relative permeability can be calculated from experimental data of both resistivity index and capillary pressure.  Good matching between relative permeability predicted from models and that one obtained from experimental work directly especially for wetting phase in samples with high permeability.  A power law model applies to the relationship between capillary pressure and resistivity index.

From the Table 2, it can be seen that the proposed model describes the adoption growth and fits in all the data sets and performs better than Kapur et al (2012) stochastic differential based Bass model. If we discuss about the proposed model, we have seen that proposed model fits best in data set DS-I and DS-II with lower value of MSE and R2 in comparison to data set DS-III and DS-IV. Although the proposed model is not among the best fit for DS-III and DS-IV but gives better fit than Kapur et al (2012) model. The proposed model describes the concept of repeat purchase growth in the adopter potential. From the Table 2, it has been observed that there is very low repeat purchase behaviour for the product as expected. As we observed that repeat purchase behaviour is more applicable to consumable product but it can’t be ignored for the case of technological consumer durable products. The loyalty towards a brand is often reflected when the products are bought by the consumer. The adoption of newer version shows consumers’ loyalty for the firm’s products. To estimate the initial size of the potential population for the new products of the existing firm, measurement of loyal population for the same firm is very important. In such case, the theory of repeat purchasing is exist and the higher is the repeat purchase value, it can be said that the better a firm is doing to keep customers loyal.

155,The Effects Of Steam Commingled Injection In Heavy Oil  Production From Fne And Bamboo Sudanese Fields (Steam,"thermal enhanced oil recovery (teor) is a family of tertiary processes defined as “any process in which heat is introduced intentionally into a subsurface accumulation of organic compounds for the purpose of recovering fuels through wells”. after hot water and heated gasses have been tried, the most common and effective vehicle used to inject heat is saturated steam. most of commingle thermal wells has a problem in steam intensity distribution among the layers, which will lead to inconsistency in steam adsorption and some layers would adsorb more than double of the designed steam injected volume. this phenomenon will lead to low productivity and negatively impact the distribution of water cut in the different layers. steam adsorption and distribution represent one of the main challenges of heavy oil production from sudanese oil fields. very limited studies have been conducted in this field in sudan oil fields, and this study is focused on addressing this challenge to maximize recover factor from each well and each field. in this paper we will highlight the challenge facing bentiu reservoir in fula north east (fne) and the bamboo fields that are located in heavy oil zone with target of production around 85% of the total reserves. these fields are of shallow depth ranging between 520m and 13m and rather low pressure gradient 1.09 psi/m, and with reservoir temperature around 44 c and 65 c respectively. the study report our investigation on the benefits of steam adsorption to enhance the oil recovery focusing on the distribution of the steam inside the layers. our ultimate goal is to design an optimum steam injection protocol that will maximize the recovery factor from these oil zones. the study covers analyzing and reviewing the actual steam intensity distribution among each layer in the two fields that are later compared with the designed ones. in a later stage, we designed a pilot model that has been designed using advanced thermal eor simulator to understand the effect of commingle injection and production (steam adsorption and distribution) using data from single layers. the results show that the production performance of wells has been improved and the cumulative oil production increased almost five times compared to last cycle and the cycle duration been extended for more than two years.. 938",,,"adsorption and distribution challenges) husham a. elbaloula sudan university of science and technology, petro-energy-e&p pdoc & pe tower, khartoum, sudan hushamali66@gmail.com, hushamali@petroenergy-ep.com dr. tagwa a. musa college of petroleum engineering & technology sudan university of science and technology khartoum, sudan tagwam@gmail.com",

Boomers, Xers, and Millennials should work together as one entity. Have the same goal and purpose of working. It is manager’s duty to build a positive environment where all generation can work together in harmony. Millennials often misunderstood as generation of problems, on the contrary, their spirit and carefree attitude are their best advantage. And despite what people believe, the have desire for collaboration. They work well alone, but if motivated with right guidance in presumably perfect working environment, they can also work better together (Martin 2005). Previous generation should also be handled properly. With the inclusion of millennials into workforce, boomers and Xers could feel neglected. Proper management step is needed to overcome a strong sense of competition between generations, and build teams where all team members feel respected and involved. Managers must perform their functions actively, in a broad spectrum, serving not as superiors but also as coaches, lecturers, even as advisers, to achieve optimal team performance. What companies need to take care of, is how to maximize their strengths, rather that tap the differences. Intergenerational relationships must always be monitored, to overcome the generation gap, which can be a contra-productive factor for the success of the company To provide the best services in the banking industries, company must constantly making continuous improvement, because customers' expectations keep increasing. Services provided today, will become out of date next year, so that it must be constantly upgraded. Feedback for improvement, can be obtained from our own team or from customers. For further research, empirical studies should be applied to identify more problem regarding team work and enhancing service quality. Datas from wider range of branches should be used, to make the model more accurate. 973","shinta winasis doctoral program universitas mercubuana jakarta, indonesia swinasissoejoso@gmail.com agung terminanto faculty of industrial engineering universitas pancasila jakarta, indonesia agung.terminanto@gmail.com ahmad badawi doctoral program universitas mercubuana jakarta, indonesia abadawi9497@yahoo.com","References

162,An Application Of Lean Assessment In A Cross-Docking  Distribution Center,"in this paper, using lean principles, we assessed one of the cross-docking dc operations in the usa. specifically, a value stream map was developed to identify existing operational areas of waste and opportunities for improvement. according to the data, collected through filed observations and analysis using the lead-time concept, several areas of waste were identified in the cross-docking operations. waste was manifested in the long queues, poor staff planning, lack of floor supervision and direction, overproduction, shifts and breaks transitions, and in the lack of discipline and sense of urgency. these types of waste contributed to the long lead-time, in some cases as much as six hours, where a carton could have taken only seven minutes from the inbound to the outbound step. the outcome of this study adds to the body of cross-docking operations knowledge. in addition, the study makes a contribution to the understanding of cross-docking workflow and lead-time issues, and the importance of value stream mapping in identifying waste in order to maximize throughput.","cross-docking, lean principles, value steam map","Cross-docking operations are becoming more complex and thus require more attention to operations planning and control. Some cross-docking DC operations employ automation in processing cartons. If not studied and analyzed thoroughly, this automation can lead to a tremendous amount of waste, and a decrease in service levels. The study at hand assessed one of the cross-docking DC operations, in the USA, using lean principles. Specifically, a value stream map was developed to identify existing operational waste and opportunities for improvement. According to the data, collected through filed observations and analysis using the lead-time concept, several areas of waste were found in the cross-docking operations. Waste was manifested in the long queues, poor staff planning, lack of floor supervision and direction, overproduction, shift and breaks transitions, and in the lack of discipline and sense of urgency. These types of waste contributed to the long lead-time, in some cases as much as six hours where a carton could have taken only seven minutes from the inbound to the outbound step. This study adds to the body of cross-docking operations knowledge. In addition, the study at hand contributes in a practical way to the understanding of cross-docking workflow and lead-time issues, and the importance of value stream mapping in identifying waste in order to maximize throughput. 983","ammar mohamed aamer faculty of engineering and technology sampoerna university jakarta, indonesia ammar.aamer@sampoernauniversity.ac.id","References

165,Other Income From Building A Franchise System :   Insight From The Franchisor,"franchise business system is the relationship between franchisor and franchisee . franchisor is obliged to provide support and franchisee with the obligation to pay the fees. it provides a beginner's franchisor's picture of rights and obligations and understands the potential of growing a business with franchise system in its business. what are the potential revenue sources that can be obtained for the franchisor? the data for this study were collected through a group discussion of members (franchise and indonesian license) that focused on information about the potential income of the franchisor. the results show that apart from the self-owned business profits there are also other franchisors' revenue sources that can be fostered from their franchisee; other income is royalties, franchise fees, advertising costs, material purchases. in the findings of the discussion of the income was the largest percentage of revenue contributors from the purchase of raw materials by the franchisee to the head office or franchisor.","franchise, royalty fee, franchise fee, marketing fee","The conclusion of the discussion illustrates that what can be earned from the franchisor as income other than his turnover profit is franchise fee, royalty fee, and advertising fee but unexpectedly that it turns out according to the experience of franchisor regular income that can support the continuity of the franchise business franchisors are the revenue they earn from the provision of materials and raw materials are supplied to the franchisee this is an income that is felt great and enjoyed by the franchisor from developing franchise system so far. It is theoretically true that the revenue from raw material purchases does not arise from the sources and potential revenues of the franchisors because it is known by franchisees of types and magnitudes as well as the percentage of income of this type, because this is the private area of the franchisor who is the sole agent of the goods supplier to their franchisee. Raw materials become mandatory franchisee purchased from the franchisor because to get the franchisee's products according to the results must follow in detail the smallest thing used by franchisors in their outlets that have been successful in can be associated with the certainty of sources of income in the franchisor can in the business which is one big income that can continue to maximize without limits the amount of it by continuing to increase the number of outlets of the franchisor.Besaran this rarely argued in the early stages of franchise purchasing process by the franchisee because most are not contained in the business plan there is only the value of the cost of materials in it already contained the profit value obtained by the franchisor of the provision of such materials. For the franchisors now beginning to realize that there is a big thing to be gained from developing this franchise system, which is primarily the potential and sources of passive income that can be obtained from the franchisee which of course must diimbangin with training, support and chain information adequate for success the franchisee that ultimately makes the franchisor's revenue potential. 1011","(forum discussion group member of waralaba dan lisensi indonesia) dede suleman program doctoral pascasarjana universitas mercubuana universitas mercubuana jakarta, indonesia dedehaseghawa@gmail.com ahmad hidayat sutawidjaya program doctoral pascasarjana universitas mercubuana universitas mercubuana jakarta, indonesia suta.phd@gmail.com indra kurniadi program doctoral pascasarjana universitas mercubuana universitas mercubuana jakarta, indonesia indra@phitagoras.co.id","References

168,Conceptual Development Of Land Value Capture (Lvc)  Model In Indonesia Infrastructure Project To Increase,"good accessibility has become a significant need for major cities in the world as well as indonesia. however, the funding ability of the government as a public agency to provide transportation infrastructure that supports accessibility is still insufficient. increased accessibility is an essential element of the cause of land value increase, where for transportation infrastructure can capture it as an investment capital or cost recovery. from this perspective, this study will explore in depth the mechanism of land value capture (lvc) about improving transportation accessibility. the research will use a combination of quantitative and qualitative approaches through questionnaires, life-cycle cost approach, in-depth interview and focus group discussion. the result of the research is expected to produce policy decision formulation, mainly related to the land value uplift so that it can be an input for decision-makers and stakeholders related to the effort to increase the benefit of an infrastructure project.","accessibility, construction",,"project benefits gunawan department of civil engineering, faculty of engineering university of indonesia depok, indonesia gunawan240277@gmail.com mohammed ali berawi department of civil engineering, faculty of engineering university of indonesia depok, indonesia maberawi@eng.ui.ac.id",
169,Scaling Up Model For Developing Second-Generation (2G)  Bioethanol By Using Palm Empty Fruit Bunches Feedstock,"as the country with the largest palm oil production in the world, the potential of lignocellulose waste like an empty fruit bunch produced by indonesia is huge. utilization of empty fruit bunch feedstock into second-generation (2g) bioethanol on a pilot scale is quite extensive. 2g bioethanol is also generally recognized as a promising market potential because of its less impact on the environment, however, the production cost is still rather high and the development of a commercially competitive process for 2g technology poses a challenge. this research attempts to investigate the model of scaling up of 2g bioethanol production to accelerate commercialization by integrating the well-established sucrose-to- bioethanol process from palm oil lignocellulose feedstock. the case of scaling up to be calculated for a chemical pathway of bioethanol production with productivity consideration. scaling up shows some of the unit process shall complete the basic step in laboratories scale. the supporting process must develop in pretreatment step likes empty fruit bunch washing, drying, and mechanical tearing. the additional process in hydrolysis step is filtering and evaporation glucose liquor until appropriate concentration. the distillation step develops for industrial scale according to alternatives products such as ethanol for solvent, pharmaceutical grade ethanol, or biofuels. the industrial-scale model estimate to produce 18.6 kl/days of bioethanol (ethanol content of 99.6%) need to support at least three crude palm oil plant with capacities 30-45 ton empty fruit bunch feedstock/hour. the model calculated empty fruit bunch feedstock about 600 ton/day.","empty fruit bunch, palm oil, scale-up","A scale multiplication study is needed to support the success of second-generation bioethanol production (Gen2) on a commercial scale. These efforts provide support for the utilization of palm oil mill waste and produce renewable alternative fuels. Second-generation bioethanol production process using chemical hydrolysis pathways is an option, especially when considering industrial productivity. The use of chemical processes will shorten the processing time. The multiplication of the scale shows that a number of processes found on the scale of laboratory experiments need to be developed more fully, especially in supporting processes such as leaching of empty bunches, empty bunch drying, mechanical fiber pretreatment separation. The addition of an industrial scale process is also required for the separation of the glucose solution and concentration of the solution before it becomes a fermentation substrate. In industrial scale also developed purification step by distillation to become main product either as solvent ethanol, pharmaceutical grade ethanol, and also fuel. In the modeling process, it is calculated that for the production of ethanol 99.5% as much as 18.6 KL/day required the support of at least three palm oil industries with a capacity of 30-45 ton empty fruit bunches/hour.","sawarni hasibuan industrial engineering department universitas mercu buana, jakarta, indonesia correspondence authors: sawarni02@gmail.com hermawan thaheer computer science department universitas pakuan, bogor, indonesia hermawantaher@gmail.com",
170,On Quantitative Analysis Of The Positive And Negative  Feelings In The Menu Selection Behavior Of The Consumers,"in recent years, management in restaurant industry has found itself in an extremely harsh environment and faces the important challenge of finding out how to attract consumers. it is assumed that ways to attract consumers to restaurants are to create attractive and individualistic restaurants and menus. from this context, we previously proposed models (kwon and yamashita 2014, kwon 2015) that analyzes the influence restaurant menu design, the menu profile and the messages it carries have to consumers’ selection behavior. on the other hand, the emotional state of consumers somehow impacts their own decision making and actions. in this study, we focused on consumers’ emotional state (both positive and negative) and analyze the effect the consumers’ emotional state has on their menu selection behavior and the impact that it has on how the messages (fuzzy message) are received. to achieve this, we first evoke certain feelings to test subjects by applying of different set of stimulus. for positive feedback, we play music to the test subjects. for negative feedback, we expose the subjects to a noise source. next, we conduct a questionnaire on the attractiveness of the restaurant menu using the menu profile designed by the l8(27) type orthogonal array of the experimental design method and an analysis will be done using data collected from this survey.","emotional state, consumer behavior",,"sunhee kwon graduate school of information and communication meiji university tokyo, japan sunnyktd3@yahoo.co.jp takaaki kawanaka institute for innovation in international engineering education, graduate school of engineering the university of tokyo 7-3-1 hongo, bunkyo-ku, tokyo, japan kawanaka@cce.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp hiroshi yamashita department of commerce, meiji university 1-1 kanda-surugadai, chiyoda-ku, tokyo, japan hyamas@meiji.ac.jp",
171,Applicability Of Arima Models For Investigating The Effects  Of Technology Spillover On Car Manufacturing Companies’,"the present study seeks to investigate the effects of technology spillover on the performance of automobile companies. in short, technology spillover is an opportunity to transfer and exploit and obtain information, technology or technical know-how, without prior planning. one of the most important indicators in evaluation of cars’ manufacturing companies’ performance is sales; hence, this study focused on sales variable and took it as a representative of technology spillover. to this aim, the sales data were collected from the domestic car manufacturing companies. for this mean, sales’ pattern during ten years is recognized using seasonal arima (s-arima) model. akaike information criterion (aic) and schwarz bayesian information criterion(bic) were used to select the most appropriate model. it is found that the selected model can be applied to forecast the sales with mean absolute percentage error (mape) in the range of 6%. this research also confirmed the idea, if foreign direct investment (fdi) is taking place in developing countries, with regards to the necessary conditions and infrastructures, technology spillover occurs, and meaningful changes in factory performance would happen. also, the proposed forecasting model can help senior managers of domestic companies in mid-term and long-term planning.",host company,"Technology spillover is a situation which a company or organization can benefit from knowledge, market, specialist staff and innovations. In Iran, enough attention has not been paid to this subject and its impact on the progress of companies both economically and technologically. The purpose of this research is to clarify the influence of technology spillover in domestic companies in Iran to make suggestions to increase the resulting benefits. In this study, the sales of one of the car manufacturing companies, which absorbed foreign capital, is considered and the companies’ time series data were modeled by the well-known ARIMA model which has not been applied previously and is the novelty of the paper. The proposed model satisfactorily met the criteria of modeling accuracy with the MAPE in the range of 6%. Therefore, it can be used to forecast the sales of companies and help the managers of the companies in their planning to improve the corporate performance by the spillover approach. In fact, moving towards the realization of spillover in the production processes and the attempts to control the market share are among the advantages of this forecasting model. As a result of moving along the technology spillover, company’s products can surpass other domestic companies that do not have external connections and gain more market share. In the case of occurrence, the technology spillover, other domestic companies will also take advantage of foreign investment and technology. This article showed that even when many of the necessary infrastructures are not available, foreign direct investment and the approach of technology spillover can make significant changes. This article is well illustrated by the effects of some parameters that may not seem very important at first glance. In this study, there were significant leaps in the company's sales chart at times when certain changes occurred. All jumps in the graph have been accompanied by serious changes in the factory situation. We have witnessed a leap in the factory sales, precisely at the points where the R & D department has been activated and its outputs have been made available to the plant. Also, solving the structural problems of the factory and establishing continuous communication with domestic and foreign technicians also triggered a sales leak. These tips can also be solved for other factories operating in similar environments. Investigating the impact of existing infrastructures in automotive companies on spillover and providing solutions to enhance technology spillover can be some topics of relevance for future researches. Also, the applicability of multivariate time series’ analysis may be of interest to feature studies in technology spillover.

179,Criteria Affecting The Selection Of Logistics Service Provider  For Retail Small And Medium Enterprise In Thailand,"small and medium enterprises (smes) in the retailer business are important for thailand. it is one of the driving forces of the country's economic and social development. as a result, the retail business is more competitive both in terms of product quality and reducing lead time of customer responsiveness. the organization has a great management of logistics which have a comparative advantage. many organizations usually choose outsourcing company to manage their logistics activities. because logistics providers have more resources, experience, and efficiency than their own. the objective of this paper is to propose criteria for selecting the logistics service provider to the small and medium enterprises in the retail. the beginning, literature reviews were searched and verified concerning the criteria from the related retail industry. then, the researcher ranked the frequency of the decision criteria discussed in descending order. the top 5 from 89 criteria are cost/ price, service quality, financial performance, delivery performance, and information technology/system. in this paper, the selected criteria from the top 20, the first to eleventh criteria would be the highest frequencies, respectively. the others would be considered appropriate due to the few frequencies of duplicate criteria. the result from this paper shows that there are 8 main criteria and 5 sub-criteria to suggest the small and medium enterprises in the retail. the criteria would be applied for weighting by analytic hierarchy process (ahp) is one of multi criteria decision making method that paper present sample weighting as a guide for those interested in education and the organization needs to be used to rank the alternative of logistics service provider.","criteria, ahp, outsource","The decision criteria used for selection of logistics providers for small and medium-sized enterprises in the retail business is very important because they can reflect the needs of the organization that lead to the effective result. The objective of this research is to propose the decision criteria for selecting the third-party logistics service providers in Thailand. The 89 decision criteria were derived by reviewing 12 relevant kinds of literature, which were published in the international journals. We had arranged the frequency rely on the article that had referred repeatedly and also inquiries from the entrepreneurship of the retail. In addition, the criteria would be validated by academic, logistics and supply chain management for reliability intensification. Eventually, 8 main criteria and 5 sub-criteria were selected to be final decision criteria. We then performed an example of weighting depending on the personal preference using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) based on the Multi-Criteria decision making (M C D M ) concept. As a matter of fact, tools selection or weighting in decision making depend on many factors, for instance, the faced situation, problem, objective, and the needs of each organization. The given weighting examples presented that the four most important criteria are Cost / Price, Performance, Capability, and Information technologies / Systems at 0.328, 0.232, 0.159 and 0.107 weighted scores respectively. Consequently, the criteria from the research can be applied to the small and medium-sized enterprises in the retail business for selection of logistics service providers. People who interested in this strategy should adapt or adjust the criteria to suit your organizational characteristics. We will then apply the decision criteria to a retail business in Thailand to prioritize the needs of the organization and select future logistics providers.

180,The Implementation Of Material Flow Cost Accounting Analysis  To Determine The Optimal Sample Size And Lot Size In,"product quality is a crucial factor that significantly affects customer’s satisfaction and many organizations emphasize and invest large amounts in designing and assuring quality system to prevent flow of defectives along the process. surviving in competitive environment many organizations attempt to reorganize their inspection policies in order to satisfy customer’s expectations while reducing costs. inefficient inspection policy can lead to significant wastage of resources. therefore, the researches on designing efficient inspection strategy have been studied extensively in last few decades. this research applied the material flow cost accounting (mfca) technique first to trace material and energy used both in terms of physical quantity and monetary units in order to analyze efficiency of process and then to design the lot size and quality inspection system that maximize ratio of total positive product cost to the total cost obtained from the mfca concept. in this paper, an artificial bee colony (abc) algorithm is used as a search algorithm for the optimal inspection sampling size and the lot size under serial multi- stage processes. this studied shows that the best solution obtained from the proposed methodology results in the production and inspection system with higher resource efficiency and greater proportion of the total positive cost.",optimal lot size,"and suggestions for further research Efficient inspection system requires valuable resources that incurs the high operation cost to the firm. It is important to seek the efficient inspection strategy while reduce cost. An efficient inspection strategy are cost trade- off between inspection cost and penalty. Besides, it will help to prevent the unnecessary processing cost added and wastage of resources in the next processes. In addition, the production lot size was considered as decision variable since it impact on inventory and WIP holding cost structure. Considering, MFCA technique to show waste costs occurred from unidentified detective items being processes unnecessarily during manufacturing operations as a result of established inefficient inspection strategy.

This network analysis provides a measurement background to identify major sources of process bottleneck, especially if it consists of large network of activities. Combined with other techniques such as SMED, administrative change, work simplification and division, and equipment reengineering, a non-productive setup time can be reduced though optimality is not guaranteed. Compared to mathematical model on addressing CPM, this combined heuristic approach provides a more practical solution in industrial settings, where fast identification of process bottleneck is the essence of rapid improvement implementation. Decision makers then could react accordingly to manage and improve/reduce duration of critical path activities.

191,Educational Program Planning Using  Project Management Techniques,"universities increasingly are facing budgetary pressures along with stringent accreditation requirements. students too have expectations of educational programs such as time to graduation, cost, quality, flexibility, and variety of course offerings. researchers have addressed program planning using techniques such as optimization, simulation, markov analysis, material requirements planning, and flow analysis (little’s law). in this paper, we invoke project management methodology to address this problem by envisioning a program from the student’s perspective as a project requiring completion of tasks (courses). each “task” has a specific duration (semester) and precedence requirements (prerequisites). from the institution’s standpoint, program management can therefore be viewed as one of managing multiple projects with the objective of minimizing average duration while meeting various student-facing criteria. however this poses a significant challenge to the institution beginning with the need to define appropriate performance measures that capture the subtleties in the education sector. moreover, educational projects as defined here vary from conventional projects in that the client’s participation goes beyond mere financial commitment and includes active value co-creation. completing courses and navigating a path to degree completion requires collaboration of student and institution through the advising process. our approach takes into account both strategic concerns and operational nuances.","project management, higher education",,"kingsley gnanendran oim department the university of scranton scranton, pa 18510, usa skingsley.gnanendran@scranton.edu manohar madan itscm department university of wisconsin-whitewater whitewater, wi 53190, usa madanm@uww.edu",

193,A Critical Evaluation Of Climate-Related Risks Associated  With Oil And Gas Industry In Libya,"risk is something found almost everywhere, and not managing risks can be extremely costly. this study focuses on climate-based risks associated with the oil and gas industry in libya. the primary data was acquired through a survey study, where a total of 150 questionnaires were distributed to a targeted population. 71 of the questionnaires returned indicating 47.3% involvement of the survey population. the water related issues are common climate risks, and most of the companies spread climate risks among insurance companies, while others retain and manage these risks. based on the ranked results, this study illustrates various critical climate risk factors. the top ten of these factors are extremely critical. these include temperatures, lack of water availability and droughts, loss of access to water, loss of peak cooling capacity, air pollution, gas leaks or pipeline explosions, burning of fossil fuels early season delays, damage to coastal facilities, and changes in land use. however, the majority of firms adopt a risk transfer strategy followed by risk response and risk acceptance strategies for treating climate risks. therefore, there is an urgent need to adopt possible ways to avoid the harmful impacts of climate risks for the improvement of the efficiency of projects.","climate risks, oil and gas, risk management","Climate risks and changes have a devastating impact on oil and gas sector worldwide regardless of any specific country. Among many stern climatic risks, water related issues like lack of water, leakages, poor water quality and floods have deep impact on oil and gas operations and consequently raises time and cost of the entire project. Similarly, high temperature has overwhelming impact and result in cost increases during oil exploration, extraction, transportation and refining operations. The climate risks also result in failure of physical assets, risks to the health and safety of the workers, intensified pressure on the available water resources; financial assets value drop and a significant damage to the reputation of the company. A rapid increase in climate risks placed a greater risk for the communities through a number of incidents. It is concluded that Libyan professionals today are familiar with the importance of climate risks and their impact on various projects in oil and gas context. It is also important to know that climate changes in neighboring countries can also influence the operations to a great extent in terms of disturbance in the transportation system, weather effects, water supply, and communication etc. The impact of human activities on climate changes due to overloading the atmosphere with CO2 is the point raised by many international organizations, but it is perceived as a low impacting factor in Libya. The geographical position and weather changes in Libya have upsetting impact. Many water related issues are the common climate risks in Libya. Although, the NOC along with the government has taken many steps to bring improvement in the availability of water resources but still it is not standardized. From the survey results, it can be concluded that professionals are confused about the responsible authority or body for minimizing or eliminating the impacts of climate risks. Thus, the major reason for this confusion is the lack of knowledge of the respondents. It is also found that oil and gas companies in Libya do have adequate climate risk reduction policy to stay away from the devastating impacts of climate risks. Most of the companies also spread climate risks among insurance companies while others retain and manage these risks. Climate risks are always critical to oil and gas companies, but not all risks have the same impact. In this study, several climate risks are identified and ranked on the basis of experienced professionals and matched the results with previous studies. Based on the ranking results, this study concludes various critical climate risk factors where top ten are extremely critical such as: high temperatures, lack of water availability and droughts, loss of access to water, loss of peak cooling capacity, air pollution, gas leaks or pipeline explosions, burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil, and gas), early season delays, damage to coastal facilities, and changes in land use. The full list is available in Table 2. It is evident in the list that a majority of top factors are related to air and water pollution and leakages. The climate risk management is a part of risk management strategy and has become an integral part of the organization strategy of oil and gas companies worldwide.

201,Increasing The Productivity Of Health Facilities In Urban Areas  In México,"in mexico, pharmacies have the possibility of offering basic health services inside or close to their facilities. the foregoing generates direct competition for non-profit civil associations such as the mexican red cross in monterrey (mrcm), which currently has nine urban health facilities, known as relief bases. as it is well known, the red cross is maintained through donations, and for the services provided, a voluntary fee is asked. due to the recent financial losses, and looking for increasing the productivity of its health care facilities, the mrcm is considering the closure of some of them with a minimal social impact due to the decrease of the community’s access to health services. the closure's impact of urban health facilities has not been deeply explored. after a bibliographic review, fifteen variables related to social impact were identified, which were grouped into three categories: competition, organization and affected population. based on these variables, this paper proposes two strategies to increase the productivity of the mrcm: a staff reassignment scheme and an optimization model to determine which relief bases should be closed with the least social impact and significantly increase of the mrcm’s average productivity.","healthcare, health facility, facility closure, productivity, dmaic","Regarding the first strategy, the proposal 7 in Table 3 was suggested to the client, which consists of maintaining the current staff of doctors and interns, but reducing in each relief base to half the staff of nurses and social workers. If the client follows this proposal for improvement for all the bases, it would reduce his salary expense by 19%, (this is MXN$137,500.00 savings per month, which could be used for any other purpose of the organization, according to his priorities In one year, savings of MXN$ 1,650,000.00 would be generated only in salaries. With respect to the second strategy, according to the needs of the organization and its scope, it was decided that closing three relief bases was within the possibilities of the MRCM: García, Monterrey and Metroplex. With this strategy, a relative increase in productivity of 9.10% is generated. In addition, by combining the suggestions proposed in both strategies it will be possible to achieve a relative increase in productivity by 21.04%, which is greater than the proposed as the general objective that was 10%. On other hand, results reveal that in an urban context, as the one analyzed in this project, the closure of bases does not affect the capacity of the market to provide the current (basic) health services.

203,Inbound Logistics In Sub-Saharan Africa: A Case Study On  Current Practices And Challenges,"inbound logistics is a major challenge in sub-saharan africa, especially in landlocked countries such as burkina faso, niger and uganda. the world bank’s logistics performance index (lpi) is a well- established international logistics benchmarking study, but does not offer context or specifics of problems faced by importers in africa. for this research, we adopt a case study approach on a large singapore- headquartered distributor with significant operating experience in africa. the case company distributes consumer electronics from principals in east asia to more than 10 countries in sub-saharan africa. semi- structured interviews of local managers based in 4 african countries and the headquarters in singapore were conducted in late 2017. interview transcripts were analyzed using thematic analysis and interpreted in conjunction with landed cost analysis. our preliminary findings indicate that while africa is often seen as a contiguous market, logistics challenges and solutions are highly diverse within the continent. more importantly, landed costs of importing into an african country do not necessarily correlate with that’s country lpi score. due to practical realities and infrastructure constraints, optimal freight movements during last-mile deliveries sometimes transcend international boundary considerations. these findings have implications for researchers and policy-makers studying logistics performance in emerging african markets.","africa, inbound logistics",,"theint moe hnin and shao hung goh school of business singapore university of social sciences singapore mhtheint001@suss.edu.sg, shgoh015@suss.edu.sg",

206,Sensitivity Analysis Of The Gas Compressibility Factor,"compressibility factor, z, values of natural gases are necessary in most petroleum gas engineering calculations. most common sources of the compressibility factor values are experimental measurements, equations of state method and empirical correlations. if laboratory measured data were unavailable, empirical correlations can be used to determine the compressibility factors. however, there might be discrepancies between laboratory-measured values with those obtained by correlations which, in turn, might affect the outcome of a study. sensitivity analysis is a technique used to determine how different values of the compressibility factor would affect well testing and material balance equation calculations. under a given set of data, this technique is used within specific boundaries that will depend on one or more methods, such as the effect that changes in reservoir's parameters obtained from build-up test and calculations of gas initial in place by using material balance equation. this study highlights how changes in the compressibility factor affect well testing results and volume of gas initially in reservoir calculated using material balance equation. three wells producing under partial water drive mechanism were considered for this study. dranchuk and abu-kassem’s method was found to have the lowest error.","gas flow, well testing","A sensitivity analysis is conducted in order to determine the effect of measurement uncertainties on performance calculations. The following are the main conclusions that can be withdrawn from this study: • Different methods, temperatures, pressures, and gas compositions covering a wide range of naturally occurring petroleum gases and non-hydrocarbon impurities have been used to calculate the compressibility factor by empirical equations then compared with the equivalent compressibility factor determined in PVT laboratory. • Determination of accurate critical parameters of mixtures is an essential step in order to obtain accurate compressibility factor value. • Using two methods to determine critical properties with known composition yield an average absolute error of 17% and a maximum error over 100%. On the other hand, two other methods used to calculate the critical properties with unknown composition have an average absolute relative error of 22 to 82%. • Dranchuk and Abu-Kassem’s method yields lower errors than the other methods; compressibility factors at an average absolute error of 17% and a maximum error of 46%. • Well testing is the only method through which information on the dynamic behavior of a well/reservoir can be obtained. • Derivative (diagnostic) analysis plot must be used to better interpret transient pressure tests. • Wells CC11 and CC13 considered in this study can be recognized as damaged wells because their skin factors are positive. • Two build-up test methods were used to estimate reservoir parameters; Horner method and MDH method which both yielded close results. • Upon comparing reservoir parameters determined by utilizing the compressibility factor obtained by fives methods with those obtained by utilizing the compressibility factor obtained experimentally, Dranchuk and Abu-Kassem’s method yielded the lowest absolute error ranging from 0 to 10%. While Brill and Biggs’s method yielded an absolute error of 0.8 to 20%.","walid mohamed mahmud department of petroleum engineering university of tripoli, tripoli-libya walidt@hotmail.com saber elmabrouk school of applied science and engineering the libyan academy, tripoli-libya saber.elmabrouk@academy.edu.ly hassan m. sbiga libyan petroleum institute (l.p.i) tripoli-libya hasanespiga@yahoo.com",
207,Risk Analysis Related To Costing And Scheduling Of Construction  Projects,"in construction projects, risks play a significant part in decision making and may affect the performance of the project. nevertheless, construction projects always face uncertainty that leads to cost and schedule risks. most of those risks can be mitigated with better up-front planning and analysis. the cost estimate should be consistent with the schedule in terms of resources assumed, their productivity and other factors. poor cost and schedule estimates lead to cost and schedule over-runs, poor decisions, funding problems, and other risks. as a result, project cost risk and schedule uncertainty should always be addressed and each task’s most likely, optimistic and pessimistic cost and duration values should also be documented. in this study, the cost and schedule risks associated to design and implementation of twenty housing units for low income people in tripoli, libya were analyzed. the qualitative risk analysis process carried results in a prioritized list of forty-four risk events. the cost and schedule risks are integrated and analyzed using monte carlo simulation. two scenarios, pre and post mitigations, were conducted. the results showed a risk reduction from 20% high, 25% medium and 55% low risk to 22% medium and 78% low with no high risks.","risk management, schedule risk","This case study represents the application of risk management process in construction projects. In order to carry the process perfectly, an efficient program tool was used called the PERT-Master Primavera Risk Analysis tool. By using an information gathering techniques a total number of forty-four risk events related to different risk categories were identified by the end of the risk identification process and experts suggested the probability of occurrence and impact scales of prioritized risk factors. Thus, the risk categories include 1) Design Risks, 2) Financial risks, 3) Legal and Contractual risks, 4) Sites construction risks, 5) Logistic risks, 6) Environmental risks, 7) Resource related risks, 8) political and war risks, and 9) Management risks. Quantitative analysis for the most important risk events was done using Monte Carlo analysis simulation. The simulation passes through two different scenarios. First scenario is the pre-mitigation scenario by which risk factors are implemented without taking into consideration the suggested mitigation actions. The other scenario was the post- mitigation. Those scenarios are compared with original plan (uncertainty only in cost and schedule without risk event). As we observe from probability histograms (original plan, pre-mitigation, post-mitigation), the time needed as a time contingency reserve in pre-mitigation scenario was 3 times as large as time needed (time contingency reserve) in original plan whereas, post- mitigation plan was 1.4 times. Whereas, the cost needed as a cost contingency reserve in pre-mitigation scenario was 44 times as large as cost needed (cost contingency reserve) in original plan whereas, post- mitigation plan was 10.3 times. 9-","mohamed a. aderbag project manager, organization for development of administrative centers (odac) tripoli, libya madebag@gmail.com saber kh. elmabrouk school of applied science and engineering, the libyan academy, tripoli, libya saber.elmabrouk@academy.edu.ly mohamed a. sherif school of applied science and engineering, engineering project management department the libyan academy, tripoli-libya awidat54@gmail.com",

209,"Risk Assessment At Heritage Sites: A Case Study Of Tripoli Old  City, Libya","there is a large number of important archaeological sites around the world that have fragile properties, and face different challenges. old city of tripoli is one of those sites which are under a variety of risks. natural disasters, development, tourism, pollution, looting, conflict and inappropriate site management are merely some examples of these risks. generally, the risks to heritage sites depend on nature, specific characteristics, inherent vulnerability and the geographical environment of the site. ultimately, it depends on the nature of external threats that affect the heritage itself. however, the level of the qualitative approach to risk is determined based on the intensity of the effect and the frequency and potential damage occurs. in this study, mainly seven risks were analyzed and assessed. the results demonstrated that the main critical risk is the risk of migratory movements and changes in the population. it has a catastrophic priority with risk magnitude (rm) of 14.5. ranked second the risk of weak management and state regulatory bodies and the risk of lack of knowledge of restoration techniques with rm of 13. whereas, the risk of insufficient skilled staff has the lowest rm of 6.5 and low priority.","heritage sites, risk management","This applied methodology of risk assessment is aimed to provide guidelines for risk management at historical and heritage sites. The scope of work, GIS vector layers, coordinates of existing border points, land-use, zoning, technical mapping, and photographic documentation for each border points were utilized as tools to identify the proposed risks at Tripoli old city in Libya. The magnitude of each specific risk is obtained based on ABC scaling method for risk analysis and 5x5 risk matrix. Afterward, the identified risks are summed up with seven main risk categories; (1) migration movement and population change, (2) week management and state regulatory body, (3) spread of rainfall and sewage affecting, (4) inadequately define roles and responsibilities, (5) insufficient skilled staff, (6) politic context, and (7) lack of knowledge of restoration techniques. Accordingly, ranked first place the risk of migration movements and population changes with RM of 14.5.

210,Calculation Of Eur Form Oil And Water Production Data,"the calculation of oil reserves (estimate ultimate recovery, eur) is required for reservoir management. it is important to differentiate between oil reserves and oil resources. the latter is roughly defined as the sum of recoverable and unrecoverable volumes of oil in place; whereas, the oil reserves can be defined as those amounts of oil anticipated to be commercially recoverable from a given date under defined conditions. however, there is always uncertainty when making reserve estimates, and the main source of uncertainty is the lack of available geological data. depending on the quantity and quality of the available data, different methods are used for the evaluation of the eur. a number of essentially straight-line extrapolation techniques (production data analysis) have been proposed to estimate the eur for oil and gas wells. thus, a detailed analysis of past performance of oil and water production data is required in order to predict the future performance of the oil and gas wells. this work utilized seven straight-line extrapolation techniques to estimate and compare the values of eur of three oil wells from the same reservoir. the comparison shows very similar estimated eur.","eur, wor, reserve, x-plot","Estimated ultimate recovery of oil and gas wells are required for evaluation and reservoir management purposes even though there is always uncertainty when making reserve estimates. Depending on the quantity and quality of the available data, different methods are used for the evaluation of the EUR. Employment of oil and water production data for reserve estimate have a certain degree of uncertainty; therefore, different methods should be applied to reduce this uncertainty. In fact, oil and water production data are regularly measured with time, which can be analyzed in a number of ways. The analysis and interpretation of the oil and water production data (WOR, fw, and fo functions) take into consideration presence of both the oil and water phases flowing simultaneously in the reservoir. In particular, this paper provides verification and application of calculating the EUR from oil and water production data. The analysis consisted of performing plots of different OWR functions versus time or cumulative production that could be extrapolated to provide an estimate of future rate of production for a well or a field. The success of this method depends on our selection of straight line points. Three field examples from Libyan oilfield were analyzed with seven different extrapolation techniques: • log(qo) versus production time, t • qo versus Np • 1/qo versus to • log(fw) versus Np • fo versus Np • 1/fw versus Np, and • Np versus X-function These techniques should be applied simultaneously in order to obtain consistent approximate of the EUR. We believe that due to the uncertainty in the accuracy of these extrapolation methods and the lack of a fully rigorous mathematical basis, the best approach is to use as many extrapolation techniques as possible. This approach helps comparing the results obtained with different approaches providing consistency and a validation element. The results are summarized in Table 8, illustrating reliable results.

212,Risk Assessment Of Eps In Building And Construction Projects:  A New Technology In The Libyan Market,"expanded polystyrene (eps) is a lightweight material that many people recognize as being used in packaging materials. eps is an innovation building material that lends to design and structural integrity of many building projects. nowadays, eps became a powerful design element and an ideal choice for green building design, offering tangible environmental advantages that can maximize energy efficiency, provide improved indoor environmental quality and enhance durability. recently, eps is manufactured as a flame retardant grade, which reduces the risk of accidental fire. with all of the previous advantages of using eps, there are still some risks associated with the utilization of this material in the construction sector, especially when it enters to the market as a new product. this study aims to assess the risks that could come up with the use of eps material as a relatively new product in the libyan construction sector. a total of 30 risks were identified and recognized into seven main categories; resource, technical, economic, management; design, installation, and others. the risk of “sudden change of foreign exchange rate” under the economic risks category, and “lack of training readily available” under the technical risks category were the most frequently mentioned risk factors.",risk assessment,"Recently, EPS has become an innovative building material that lends to the design and structural integrity of many building and construction projects. In Libya, there is a poor and an inadequate professional support in the use of EPS material for construction. Most graduate students and practicing engineers are not conversant with this new building technologies and therefore often design housing using the traditional technology. There lacks research information on the acceptability of use of EPS materials by professionals in Libyan's construction industry. The slow uptake of EPS as a construction material in Libya is has further attributed to lack of awareness of EPS existence in the market. This study aims to assist the risks that could come up with the use of EPS material as a relatively new product in the Libyan construction sector. A total of 30 risks was identified and recognized into seven main categories; (1) resource risks, (2) technical risks, (3) economic risks, (4) management risks; (5) design risks, (6) installation risks, and (7) other risks. Under the economic risks category, the risk of sudden change of foreign exchange rate, and the risk of lack of training readily available in using ESP in building and construction projects under technical risks category were the most frequently mentioned risk factors. 6.","mohamed a. sherif school of engineering and applied science, engineering project management department the libyan academy, tripoli-libya awidat54@gmail.com saber kh. elmabrouk faculty of engineering, university of tripoli tripoli, libya s.elmabrouk@uot.edu.ly abdelwahed h. elalem school of engineering and applied science, engineering project management department the libyan academy, tripoli-libya aelalem@ymail.com",

214,Statistical Basketball Player Position Analysis Anna Wu,"the purpose of this stem project is to develop the sports analytics concept for playing basketball by forming a special basketball team. authors have defined the key functional metrics for each of the three player positions: guard – shooting and assists; forward – shooting and rebounds; and center – blocks and rebounds. the objective is to maximize team performance through effective performance across all player positions. in order to maximize team performance, guard will try to pass the ball to forward. center should focus on rebounding and blocking, not steals. each player’s statistics are recorded by two different individuals. hypothesis tests are conducted (1) to verify whether players can fulfill their position within their team, and (2) to perform a position comparison between the two teams. sample sizes are determined in order to conduct a 2-proportions test at 95% confidence. in the analyze phase, the authors decided to add steals (for all three players), turn overs (for guard), and offensive/defensive rebounds into the project scope. statistical analysis software (jmp and minitab) was used to study the multi-correlation patterns. the winning team demonstrates better team communication among players by playing according to this unique basketball game player position model.","stem, basketball, sports analytics","and Future Work The Authors successfully designed a special Basketball Game position model which can facilitate team communication. The baseline analysis sample size was too small and was missing critical sample statistics for Steals and Turnovers. The improved analysis can facilitate team communication on both Offense and Defense. The use of statistical analysis to make inferences on position and team performance in the population at large can help each team study their performance pattern and to study each player's’ strengths/ weaknesses relative to their position & across teams. Future efforts will be focused on studying a larger sample size in improve decision accuracy. For example, a future study could compare three or more teams. This way, there will be a higher chance of inferring the correct conclusion of a true performance difference (or lack thereof) between players of the same position & across positions across teams.

216,Modeling And Simulation Of Queuing Systems Using  Stochastic Petri Net And Arena Software: A Case Study,"stochastic petri nets (spn) and arena simulation software can both be used to study the qualitative and quantitative behavior of systems in a single environment. however, no comparative studies of the two formalisms have been conducted. therefore, this paper proposes a methodology to evaluate the selected formalisms by using the visekriterijumska optimizacija i kompromisno resenje (vikor) method, which can provide a better understanding of both formalisms and prepare a fertile ground for exchanging ideas and techniques between the two. a real world system of the main student restaurant of the king saud university in saudi arabia is discussed in this paper to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed methodology. first, data for the study is collected, and thereafter, the appropriate distribution is adapted for the data points using the arena input analyzer. a visual network was then developed and run on the stochastic petri nets and arena simulation software in order to acquire output for the simulation. the results showed that the arena and spn simulation software are convenient for modeling and analyzing the case study. however, using the vikor approach, a comparative analysis showed that spn is better than arena.","queuing systems, arena","Simulation is the imitation of the operation of a system over time or real-world process. A descriptive technique of the simulation enables a decision-maker to evaluate the behavior of a model under various conditions. Two of the several different commercial off-the-shelf software—stochastic Petri nets and Arena—can be used to develop a simulation model. However, no comparative studies of these two formalisms have been conducted. Therefore, in this paper a methodology to evaluate the selected formalisms by using the ViseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR) method is proposed. The criteria used to evaluate the best simulation technique are divided into running times, accuracy, development of scenarios, modeling power, and modeling abstraction. Two simulation techniques, Arena and SPN, are considered. Simulation models for the case study were developed using the Arena and SPN software, and the results show that long student waiting time exists at the KSU restaurant. Accordingly, in order to reduce such waiting time, one suggested improvement is made for this phase. Scenario changes are made to the self-service area by removing the second self-service section (Move the cold drinks to the first self-service section; move the food utensils and condiments to an area after the cashier section). As a result, the new averages of the waiting time in line 1 are 13.82 and 12.00145 min per student for Arena and SPN models, respectively. For line 2, the waiting time averages are 13.65 and 12.8154 min per student for Arena and SPN models, respectively. In addition, the results show that the Arena and stochastic Petri nets are convenient for modeling and analyzing the case study. However, based on the VIKOR approach, the comparative analysis shows that SPN is better than Arena. The future work on this study is to develop a flexible simulation model that can be applied to different types of systems that is able to yield more accurate results. In addition, more complex properties can be considered during the development of the model using the full version of the software. This will allow the creation of a more detailed model with a wider performance variety, which can be used to study resource allocations, such as the reduction of server idle time.

We also explore the impact of varying carbon cap values on the total costs and the inventory level. We show that there is a trade-off between emission and total cost, that is, lower emission is achieved at higher cost. The results is in line with earlier works such as Benjaafar et al., 2010; Hoen et al, 2010; Palak et al., 2014; and Muhammed et al., 2017. An implication to this is that there is a potential that companies need to absorb more costs when the objective related to the environment is given a higher priority. In such a case an important future works is to develop a framework for making decisions under different situations, for example, under a different level of willingness to absorb additional costs in the supply chain. In this research, we also attempt to explore the relationships between inventory level kept by the customer and the carbon emission. The results show that customer tends to keep higher inventory when the carbon cap is relaxed. However, to find a firm conclusion on this, further works involving more extensive set of experiments would be needed.","thina ardliana shipbuilding institute of polytechnic surabaya doctoral student at industrial engineering department sepuluh nopember institute of technology surabaya, indonesia ardlianathina@gmail.com, thina15@mhs.ie.its.ac.id i nyoman pujawan and nurhadi siswanto industrial engineering department sepuluh nopember institute of technology surabaya, indonesia pujawan@ie.its.ac.id, siswanto@ie.its.ac.id",

226,Measuring The Effectiveness Of Total Productive Maintenance In  The South African Food Manufacturing Industry,"the current economic growth has pushed the manufacturing sector to go through important changes over the past decade. the main reason of this situation is due to the current course of competition, which has been dramatically increasing in the local as well as global market. consequently, the focus of both products’ manufacturers and customers has been on the quality, delivery time, as well as product’ cost. due to these, many manufacturing industries seek to develop and implement a quality system to constantly enhance and increase both quality and throughput. total productive maintenance (tpm) is considered as an approach aiming to guarantee an effective management of company’s resources by means of employee participation and empowerment, as well as to augment the availability, quality, and product throughput to reduce the need for additional capital investment. to this end, the present paper proposes tpm as a roadmap for south african food manufacturing industry. mixed methodology was used to obtain out of this study best possible results. the study was conducted at a larger south african food manufacturing company that has two sister companies (subsidiary a and b). both primary and secondary data were collected. the productivity and values of overall equipment effectiveness of both subsidiary a and b were calculated by employing standard equations. the findings revealed potential major challenges faced by those two sister companies. it was also shown in this study that both sister companies have less rate of overall equipment effectiveness when comparing to the world standard values, which caused many failures. furthermore, there is a variation in terms of values of overall equipment effectiveness, performance, availability, and quality at both sister companies. despite this fluctuation of value, we noticed that subsidiary a has got better performance than subsidiary b regarding productivity and overall equipment performance.","challenges, productivity","can be drawn up from the results above that subsidiary A is performing well than subsidiary B with regards to both partial and total productivity. And this has a significant impact on the costs incurred in the operations of both sister companies. III.2. Overall Equipment Effectiveness This sub-section aims at measuring the extent of TPM at subsidiary A and subsidiary B at a company X (south African food manufacturing company). This analysis is based on quality, performance, availability, and OEE. Additionally, the results of both subsidiaries are benchmarked with those set up from world standard. To this end, figure 5 below demonstrates this analysis. Figure 5: Graphical representation of parameters of OEE and its comparison The first observation from the figure 5 above, is that the results of subsidiary A and B fall behind the values set up for world standard. The results also demonstrate that subsidiary A has got good results regardless of parameters when comparing to subsidiary B. considering this, it can be concluded that the performance level regarding TPM is good than subsidiary B. III.3 Challenges faced in implementing TPM Besides, the results presented above, this study also seek to determine the types of challenges face at both subsidiary A and B when implementing TPM. The data were collected from 527 questionnaires, participants were urged to indicate on a scale of 1 to 5 (where 1 was strongly agree and 5 was strongly disagree). Thus, the results are presented in the figure 6 below: 63.7 51.7 85 83.8 81.83 90 79.66 68.32 95 89.5 86.8 99 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 Subsidiary A Subsidiary B World standard values Rate (%) OEE Equipement availability Performance Quality 1387","ndala yves mulongo and pule kholopane faculty of engineering and the built environment university of johannesburg, po box, 524, auckland park, 2006, south africa","References

227,Contractors’ Perspective On Application  Of Earned Value Analysis (Eva) As Cost,"poor cost management is a severe problem that occurs in the current construction industry, resulting in big amount of cost overrun which not only in malaysia but also happens frequently in the global construction industry. traditional methods such as standard financial s-curve, daily monitoring, weekly or monthly report are less efficient in monitoring and controlling the cost performance of a project. this paper is focusing on the investigation of the effectiveness of earned value analysis (eva) as cost controlling tools in construction projects in contractor’s perspective. eva is a cost controlling technique that unites the performance of cost and schedule. descriptive study is carried out in this research and survey form was used to collect the quantitative data from target respondents who are grade 7 contractor firms in petaling district. the findings have shown that the awareness of eva technique is low among study area as the frequency of usability is low. however, the findings have indicated that eva is able to improve the cost performance of the construction projects. the contribution of eva which is remedial actions can be taken earlier to keep the cost within budget is ranked as the 1st place among the listed contributions.",cost overrun,"The result of the findings has shown EVA technique is able to improve the cost performance of the projects. The following conclusions can be drawn from the present study by according to the most obvious finding to emerge from this study which shows that EVA is effective in controlling the cost of the projects and three of the objectives in this research have been achieved. After the interpretation of the findings, the factor that contributes the most in the cost overrun of the project is evaluated and the result shown is poor cost control method. Besides, the greatest benefit that contributed by EVA in improving the cost performance is remedial action can be taken earlier to keep the cost within the budget; while the biggest challenge that encountered by contractor is complete information of the expenditure of the project is needed in order to generate an accurate EVA graph. In a nutshell, the effectiveness of the application of EVA technique in improving cost performance could be a","controlling tools in construction projects mohd amir shazwan hashim and lee may han quantity surveying department inti international university, nilai, negeri sembilan, malaysia amirshazwan.hashim@newinti.edu.my, i13004148@student.newinti.edu.my nurul munazzah sadikin faculty of built environment linton university college mantin,negeri sembilan,malaysia munazzah@ktg.edu.my","References

228,Community Based Approach On Micro  Finance Service With Social Entrepreneur,"indonesian economic growth has been trending down from about 6.5 % in 2010 to less that 5 % in second half of 2017. although global economy is also still struggling to recover after world crisis, economic expectations improved by prospects of growth in the last quarter of 2017. in february 2017, unemployment data was recorded at 5.33 percent or 7.01 million people. when compared to february 2016 and then reached 5.50 percent, then open unemployment data in february 2017 decreased 0.17 percent or 10,000 people. bappenas data states that the projected population of indonesia until 2035 is estimated to reach 305,652,400 million people. if there is no significant policy breakthrough, no one can imagine tpt rate will also increase , and can cause various social issues. to promote economic growth, indonesian government should encourage enterpreneurship and innovation. one of the new economic concepts is the ""community-based creative economy"" which is a community-driven concept of entrepreneurship that is socially committed to bring changes to be more advanced and cooperative-minded. this study using the methodology by analysis of indepth interviews and observed from some user of microfinance institution as a role model. the concept aimed at lower and middle-class workers, and depends on three vital elements : government, private economic institutions (cooperatives and banking) and educational support from the university. such a concept of social entrepreneurship is a powerful opportunity to be implemented in indonesia, but still facing many challenges if tends to be developed into massive, structured, and sustainable movement. the purpose of this research is to present the result of the application of microfinance service model with community-based in parish of robertus cililitan, east jakarta. the research is conducted qualitatively, literature reviews from related theories were used to explained the policy. from this research, micro finance model had significant influence for the improvement of the welfare of middle to lower class workers. further research with broader spectrum is needed to established model that can be applied in more global and comprehensive way.","community, creative economy, prosperity 1488","With the idea of empowering the community-based creative economy through social entrepreneurship economic development is driven through a group or community economic development approach or microeconomic approach. It has a tremendous power to improve people's lives, especially the middle to lower layers, thereby reducing the gap between the poor and the lack of capital with the rich who have the capital. Social entrepreneurship is a paradigm that has been proven to support the nation's economic development. Governments, private and colleges need to work together to be the guarantor of social entrepreneurship sustainability. Because, basically the estuary of it all is the improvement of community life that sustains the performance of government work and stimulate the economy. Efforts that can be done by the government is to shade the business with regulations that favor the strengthening of social entrepreneurship patterned and patterned community-based creative economy to the middle layer of society down. It is best if this policy reaches the level of district (kelurahan) through training, coaching and providing or adding capital with a credit union system with low interest rates. Efforts that can be made by the private sector is to pay attention in cooperation with the government to manage well and structured by providing capital assistance and capital development and management of places for the creative economy communities so as to create quality and quantity improvement of existing entrepreneurial groups or communities. The university or college in collaboration with the private sector and the government continues to provide the results of scientific studies on the concept of social entrepreneurship that is able to increase the economic growth of micro and were able to reduce the social problems, but it can involve themselves in the implementation of social entrepreneurship by sending students to become a volunteer for assisting communities creative economy tiny layer of society whose role and to cultivate seedlings young entrepreneurs are creative. Thus the role of government, private sector and universities in order to empower community-based creative economy with the concept of social entrepreneurship to achieve a more prosperous living standard for the people of a small layer can run massive, structured and sustainable. 1493","concept case study : parish of robertus cililitan hendro budiyanto doctoral management program faculty of post graduate mercu buana university jakarta, indonesia hendrokaj@gmail.com sri witjaksono widiadibrata doctoral management program faculty of post graduate mercu buana university jakarta, indonesia maswi85@yahoo.com","References

229,Case Study Using Multicriteria Analysis Methods In  Project Selection,"there are several models of multicriteria analysis methods, but there is no common agreement on the most effective method for project selection (archer & ghasemzadeh, 2004). in this article, we will present a case study for the selection of projects using two families of multicriteria analysis methods namely the methods of upgrading electre ii and i and utility methods, and then give a comparative summary of the two categories. through this case study, we note that the results obtained are different depending on the method used and the intended purpose, and the choice between a method close to the utility theory (maut) and outranking method must be made according to the advantages and limitations of these categories of multicriteria analysis methods (mam).","electre, maut","on MAUT methods We note that the results obtained are different depending on the method used and the intended purpose. Although the MAUT approach highlights a wide variety of easily comparable numerical solutions and uses fairly simple computational methods, it is still complex for the decision-maker to visualize what utility is associated with. performance given on each criterion and give a total pre-order. In addition, it is a totally compensatory method, that is to say that the bad score of an action on a criterion can be completely compensated by its good score on another criterion which complicates the interpretation results obtained.","houda tahri and omar drissi kaitouni imosys, engineering, management and optimization of systems mohammadia school of engineers avenue ibn sina b.p. 765 agdal rabat, morocco htahri@gmail.com, drissi@emi.ac.ma","references and the 
weightings of the criteria and / or the 
substitution rates between criteria. 
- Need a lot of information (values and 
parameters) 
-Additional methods: compensatory. 
-Delicate interpretation of the parameters, 
-A sensitivity analysis should be conducted 
systematically, to release the only robust 
information, but this is rarely done. 
 
5. Conclusion: 
All multi-criteria decision support methods have the advantage of being able to make a decision based on multiple 
criteria and not on the basis of a single criterion (profit for example). Beyond this observation, the results obtained 
are different from one method to another. Thus, the choice between Utility Theory (MAUT) and outranking method 
must be done according to the advantages and limitations of these broad categories of multicriteria analysis methods 
(MAM). Indeed, MAUT has the advantage of being easier to use but its compensatory character makes the 
interpretation of the results difficult. Unlike the ELECTRE method, which is more difficult to apply, but it helps to 
inform the decision-maker about his choice between the actions or projects to be kept and those to be eliminated but 
doesn’t solve the problem of decision-making itself. This is why the use of other methods is still necessary to 
complete the decision-making process. For example, the AHP (Analytic hierarchy process) which allows to 
hierarchically structure a complex, multi-criteria, multi-person and multi-period problem. This method is used for 
decision making in complex situations where human perception, judgments, and consequences have long-term 
implications (Bhushan and Rai, 2004). Thus, the combination of several methods remains possible."
230,Sustainable Suppy Chain Value Stream  Mapping (Ssc-Vsm),"high competitiveness level in manufacture industry has caused companies to compete not only to be efficient (lean) but also sustainable. in order to achieve sustainability, a company requires a thorough examination of the product design process, the manufacturing process, and the overall supply chain. many studies have attempted to develop value stream mapping (vsm) that is integrated with environmental and social aspects to produce sustainable system, but they fail to describe the overall performance of sustainability throughout the product supply chain. to do so sustainable supply chain value stream mapping (ssc-vsm) has been developed. ssc-vsm aims to analyze sustainability performance throughout the product supply chain. in term of the product supply chain considered are pre manufacturing, manufacturing, and distribution. aspects that are considered are economic, environment, and society in which each aspect has some indicators. this research aims to extend the previous research focusing on only manufacturing stage under the concept of sustainability valye stream mapping (sus-vsm) to all stage in supply chain and to apply the modified sus-vsm named ssc-vsm in two bottled drinking water companies. the application aims to assess and compare those companies and identify which indicator that less efficient and should be improved.","lean manufacturing, ch4","and Future Work It can be concluded that SSC-VSM can be used as a sustainability tool. SSC-VSM is able to identify economic, environmental, and social wastage throughout the product supply chain. Based on the results of SSC-VSM implementation, it is found that there are differences in sustainability performance between the two companies. This indicates that firm size has an effect on sustainability performance. Factors that cause performance differences are different quality specifications, production capacity and type of process used. PT X focuses on low TDS (<6) and the manual production process leads to the need for back wash filter process twice daily. The existence of this activity leads to the consumption of time, water, and energy that is high enough at the manufacturing stage. In contrast to PT Y back wash process carried out for 3 months so that the consumption of time, water, and energy for each unit produced is quite low. PT X is classified as a small company because it has 14 workers and has a production capacity of 6000 units per month. This causes the number of orders on suppliers are not able to meet the minimum order so that the company purchase material using the company vehicle. This causes the energy consumption and there are emissions generated. Similarly with PT X, PT Y does purchase by own vehicle to purchase water at mountain springs. But for other material sent by supplier because it meets the minimum order. This is considering that the production capacity of PT Y is quite high at 30,000 units per month and PT Y is included in medium companies because the workers above 50 people. In the overall distribution stage both companies have the same performance. The future work can develop several indicators that can generalize a variety of products in sustainability measurement. 3584","the application in two bottle drinking water companies windy megayanti industrial engineering department institut teknologi sepuluh nopember, surabaya, indonesia email: windymegayanti.15@mhs.ie.its.ac.id maria anityasari industrial engineering department institut teknologi sepuluh nopember, surabaya, indonesia email: maria@ie.its.ac.id udisubakti ciptomulyono industrial engineering department institut teknologi sepuluh nopember, surabaya, indonesia email: udisubakti@gmail.com","References

241,Industrial Strategy Development Of Core Competence In  Pekalongan City,"the development of core competencies is expected to increase the competitiveness of national industries, because it the performance becomes measurable and easy to evaluate its development program. global economic competition has been increasingly right now. the low competitiveness of the industry at international market is still a challenge to the national industry. industrial development can be done by utilizing the natural resources, and focus on the region competence. this research was conducted to help know the core competence of industry by take case study at pekalongan city. the first phase is determining regional competence on some existing industrial alternatives. the alternative is obtained based on secondary data collection and using method of analytic hierarchy process (ahp). the results will be in the form of core competencies that can be developed, as a competitiveness in pekalongan city. phase two, plans the development strategy using interpretive structural modeling (ism) method. in designing the core competency, it will done by discussing with experts to get additional analysis about the strategy to be done.","management strategy, core competence","and Recommendation Core competence is determined from the largest PDRB, which is the largest contributor in economic activity Pekalongan City. Determination of core industrial competence in Pekalongan City is done by using Analytical Hierarcy Process method). There are 3 levels in the determination of core competencies. The first level is level 0, which is the goal to be achieved, namely choosing core competencies. The second level is level 1, the selection criteria. Criteria for choosing core competencies are contributions to regional development, social impact and equity of income, availability of human resources, infrastructure, value-added prospects, competitiveness, marketing, locality values, geographic conditions, policy and institutional support. The last level is level 2, which is an alternative industrial sector to be selected. The industrial sector that is used as an alternative option is based on the industry sector which has the highest distribution, namely the Trade Industry, and the Processing industry. The election to find out the core competencies that are owned by the Pekalongan city, selected from the processing industry. In processing industry which is in the city of Pekalongan is divided into three classifications of industries, namely metal machine and chemistry industry, varied industry, and agricultural industry. The results of data processing using AHP method indicate that which has the highest priority value is varied industry with a weight value of 0.668, then the industry becomes the core competence of Pekalongan City. One part of multifarious industry which has the highest contribution is Pekalongan batik industry. Based on the result of the discussion with the batik businessmen of Pekalongan, there is 6 variables that is improving the marketing, support from the government, the development of technology, the development of information media for batik, development of labor, and the development of batik models and products. The recommendations for further research are to get more insight not only from the existing industry side but also from local government, as well as other experts as inputs for the design and determination of strategies. The recommendation for future research is need for further research into the design of an industry strategy on the basis of core competence. Requires application of core competencies in other regions or industries.","fadila paramitha department of industrial engineering universitas indonesia salemba, jakarta, indonesia fadila.paramitha@ui.ac.id rahmat nurcahyo department of industrial engineering universitas indonesia kampus baru ui depok, depok 16424, indonesia rahmat@eng.ui.ac.id",
242,Safety Perceptions In University Teaching Laboratory  Nur Annisa Faradilla Puteri,the numerous cases of laboratory incidents make it clear that safety in laboratories become an important issue to be discussed. this research investigates the safety perceptions of students on using university teaching laboratory. this study is concentrated to the students who are regularly use chemicals substances in teaching laboratory. regression is used to get the correlation between safety perception and safety behaviour among students in the teaching laboratory activities. the result showed that respondents have good perceptions on safety in university teaching laboratories but there’s still improvement needed to raise a good perception of threats in order to increase safety behavior.,"safety perceptions, safety risk","of Safety and Health Perceptions in Work-Related Transport Activities in Ghanaian Industries (Atombo et al., 2017), the research was in the same interest but in the different scope, which stated that interventions to improve safety and health concentration has been on drivers’ safety practice with less attention to safe driving environments and vehicle usage, while this study has shown that external environment and chemicals usage (susceptibility) have significantly affected the safety perception of threats and that leads to safety behavior taken by the users. This might be caused by on the previous research, there is a gradual raising of health and safety standards and increased awareness of the benefits of safety practices at the workplaces (Atombo et al., 2017) while in the current study, people’s perception is significantly impacted by the environment and hazard susceptibility so when the environment is not supported, they might have lower perceptions and when they dont perceived hazard susceptibility, the same thing will also happen. The future research that can be taken to reinforce what is written on this paper is quite about the more comprehensive discussion about the correlation of safety perceptions and safety behavior in university teaching laboratory and the elaboration of how safety behavior affects safety perceptions. 5. Conclusion and Recommendations From the data analysis, we can conclude that most of the respondents have good perception on safety in using chemicals in laboratories and their perceptions have significantly correlated with safety behavior that they take in teaching laboratory activities. The good perception is caused by some reasons. Most of them has introduced to basic safety and health and this raised their awareness to the risk they will face on using chemicals in teaching laboratory. Then, the university management quite have supportive program to protect the laboratory users from accident, such as safety inspections. Also, respondents are mostly aware with their safety when knowing many cases related chemicals usage in laboratory. However, there still are some potential improvement, such as : a. Update Hazard Identification, Risk Assessment, and Determining Control (HIRADC), b. Conduct safety system management audit periodically, c. Create faculty safety team and conduct monthly meeting to discuss safety issues, d. Conduct emergency response simulation, e. Conduct annual safety talks, f. Enrich safety posters and signages, g. Conduct regular safety training to asisstant laboratories and lecturers, h. Provide more adequate protective equipments. 1582","industrial engineering department universitas indonesia jakarta, indonesia nur.annisa62@ui.ac.id rahmat nurcahyo industrial engineering department universitas indonesia jakarta, indonesia rahmat@eng.ui.ac.id","References

244,The Influence Of Nonlinear Loads On Optimal Operation  Control Of Electrical Distribution System,"the main objective of power system operation is to supply the customer electricity demand with acceptable quality in an optimum way. with constantly varying demand, this objective may not be easily achieved. an adaptable system enhancement is therefore necessary to attain the objective. one of the strategies is controlling the switchable devices in distribution system for the purpose of maintaining the system voltage within the acceptable limits and minimizing the loss with minimum control action. one of the electricity customers is industrial institution, where some types of loads are nonlinear. this may include electrical machine and power electronic devices. besides drawing the power from the grid, these loads may also inject distortion to the system causing destructive effects. this study proposes optimization scheme on distribution system considering the presence of nonlinear loads. in addition to control the system voltage and reduce the loss, system distortion should also be suppressed. to include the nonlinear loads into optimization, the calculation of power flow should be extended to accommodate the characteristic of nonlinear loads. the optimal control of switchable devices is determined using genetic algorithm (ga). the significant of involving distortion injected by nonlinear loads are highlighted.","nonlinear loads, optimization, distortion","The optimal control of distribution system is investigated due to the presence of nonlinear loads. The main conclusions are: • The optimal control of distribution system may be carried out by switching the LTC and shunt capacitors, • Comprehensive device control may be simultaneously determined using Genetic Algorithm, • The purpose of including nonlinear loads on optimal dispatch problem is to assure the system distortion does not exceed the maximum allowable limit, • Straightforwardly taking the effects of nonlinear loads into account enables achieving higher energy saving and better average voltage improvement.

246,Simultaneous Consideration Of Assemblability And  Disassemblability For Fastening Method Selection,"remanufacturing has achieved increased attention in recent years for reprocessing end-of-use (euo) and end-of-life (eol) products. technical feasibility as well as profitability of a remanufacturing process is affected by the assemblability and disassemblablity of products. selection of fastening methods during the design stage affects not only product assemblability but also the disassemblability of used products for remanufacturing. fastening methods selected for easier assembly during initial manufacturing may cause difficulties during disassembly for remanufacturing or vice versa. this would in turn have an impact on the cost of assembly and disassembly. hence, decisions made during early product development regarding fastening method should address assemblability, disassemblability and cost concerns. in previous studies, simultaneous consideration of assemblabilty, disassemblablity and cost factors for fastening method selection was not addressed properly. in this paper, a methodology for fastening method selection is proposed by which all the three factors are simultaneously considered in the selection of fastening methods. in the proposed methodology, the selection problem is formulated as an optimization model with the objective of minimizing the overall assembly and disassembly costs. genetic algorithm (ga) are employed to solve the model. a case study on the selection of fastening methods for laptop computers is conducted to illustrate the proposed methodology and to evaluate its effectiveness.",fastener selection,"A company which plans to offer both new and remanufactured products must consider assemblability and disassemblability issues during design stage. Assemblability and disassemblablity of a product is affected by the types of fastening methods used. Some fastening methods which facilitate the assembly process may not be appropriate from the disassembly perspective and vice versa which makes selection of appropriate fastening method a critical and challenging task. In this study, a methodology for fastener selection which simultaneously considers assemblability, disassemblability and cost factors is proposed. In the proposed methodology, an optimization model is formulated with the objective of minimizing the sum of the product assembly and disassembly costs. A genetic algorithm was used to model the problem which was then solved in Matlab. To illustrate the proposed methodology, a case study on fastening method selection for a laptop computers was conducted. The result of the experiment showed the model’s effectiveness in selecting optimal fastening methods for ease of assembly and disassembly such that the overall assembly and disassembly cost can be reduced. The proposed methodology offers a guide to designers in selecting optimal fastening methods by simultaneously considering ease of assembly, disassembly and related cost. The proposed methodology can be improved further. In this study, variability of condition of the EOL product which can affect the disassembly time, was not taken into account. Furthermore, the degree of damage caused to fasteners during product’s life time was also not considered. These two factors could be considered in future to further enhance the model’s capability.

254,Ultradiscrete Exponential Newell-Whitham Model : A Cellularautomaton Model For Trafﬁc Flow,"the exponential newell-whitham (enw) model, deﬁned by a differential equation with time-delay, is one of the most important models for traffic flow. in this presentation, we propose the ultradiscrete enw model,which is a cellular-automaton model , by applying the ultradiscrete method to the enw model. we first point out that there is a close relationship between the enw model and the lotka-volterra (lv) equation, which is a soliton equation. the time-discrete analogue of the lv equation which keeps its integrability is well-known in the field of integrable systems. considering these facts, we then give a time-discrete analogue of the enw model. furthermore, we present its exact solution using the bilinear method as well as kanai and tutiya did for the original enw model. also, since the ultradiscrete method can result in reducing soliton equations to cellular automata which inherit the solitonic nature such as an inﬁnite number of conservation laws and soliton solutions, we apply it to the discrete-time enw model and its exact solution to obtain the ultradiscrete enw model and its exact solution. finally, we evaluate the validity of this model as a traffic flow model by conducting simulation.","traffic flow, cellular automaton, integrable systems",,"kouyo suzuki graduate school of science and engineering hosei university graduate schools kajino-chyou 3-7-2, koganei-shi, tokyo, japan kouyo.suzuki.7g@stu.hosei.ac.jp shin isojima faculty of science and technology hosei university kajino--chyou 3-7-2, koganei-shi, tokyo, japan isojima@hosei.ac.jp",

263,Discrete Wavelet Packet Based Spectrum Sensing In  Cognitive Radio Using An Improved Adaptive Threshold,"thresholding is a very important technique in the detection of spectrum holes in cognitive radios. it is the benchmark by which a cognitive radio decides if a spectrum hole is present or not in a given frequency spectrum. however, the method by which a cognitive radio computes the threshold for any given scenario can be quite a challenge in terms of accuracy, speed, and efficiency. fixed thresholds are less cumbersome to implement, but they are characterized by undesirable sensitivity and performance issues in the radio environment in which the cognitive radio operates due to uncertainty in noise level. on the other hand, adaptive thresholds give superior performance to fixed thresholds due to their ability to adjust their computational parameters in response to changes in the cognitive radio environment. in this paper, we present a discrete wavelet packet transform (dwpt) based spectrum sensing in cognitive radio with an improved adaptive threshold in terms of speed. the approach developed in this paper halves the number of computations needed to determine the adaptive threshold for each sub-band channel in a discrete wavelet packet transform. the results obtained show the method is efficient, fast, and dynamic in response to the variations in the cognitive radio environment.","cognitive radio, optimization, adaptive threshold, noise uncertainty","In this paper, we explored the norm of the Euclidean distance between two vectors that characterize the terminal sub-bands of the DWPT. This vector was used as the basis for the improvement of a DWPT thresholding technique. The improvement achieved was in terms of speed of calculation required to compute the adaptive threshold for all sub-band channels at a given level of decomposition. The results and analysis of this approach showed that the accuracy of the proposed scheme with respect to increase in SNR was as expected.

268,Abstract,,,"Global warming has prompted nations to pay more attention to ecological protection, resource integration, and laws dedicated to carbon emissions regulation. If companies can develop innovative approaches to provide low carbon products, the performance will reflect significantly on reputation and market share. Therefore, low carbon value design is an innovative perspective for manufacturers to maximize core competitiveness and minimize environmental shocks. This paper constructs a low carbon design model (LCVCM) based on green design strategy. LCA is used to define and estimate all product components resulting in carbon footprints. Simultaneously, the simulation tool has been applied to test product components and clarify the optimal low carbon improvement, calculating for the various interacting factors. This paper provides a preliminary study to help corporations accurately assess and reduce the carbon footprints of mass customized green products. It drives an original product from a less green into a greener and more eco-efficient product. The implementation method involves four steps: “Scoping the process of product”, “Analyzing carbon emission on each process of whole life cycle ”, “Simulating carbon Impact”, and “ Targeting and Improving the Product”. A model is created accordingly to support the carbon reduction. From the result of this case study, the carbon footprints are significantly reduced. In addition, this model also presents simulations with two scenarios and explores how the design-effective method can reduce the carbon footprint. The result of the analysis demonstrates that the connection between carbon footprints and the green component life-cycle design is interrelated. According to the results, the green design strategy is appropriate for the carbon emission issues and the proposed model serves as an adequate base for analyzing carbon emissions of similar products in a larger context. This paper expects that the industry understands clearly",,"REFERENCES

277,"The Influence Of Culture, Job Satisfaction And Motivation  On The Performance Lecturer / Employees","this study aims to examine the influence of culture, job satisfaction and motivation on the performance of lecturers/employees in universities. respondents numbered 180 people, consisting of all full time lecturers and permanent employees. structured questionnaires were developed and distributed to 180 respondents. valid questionnaires amounted to 146 pieces. data were analyzed using 2 methods, namely: 1). descriptive analysis, and 2). multivariate regression analysis with sem (structural equation modeling). the results showed that (i) culture and job satisfaction affect motivation; (ii) culture also affects job satisfaction; (iii) job satisfaction and motivation affect the performance; (iv) culture does not affect the performance; (v) culture and job satisfaction affect the performance through motivation. thus, job satisfaction factor is an important factor to be managed in order to increase motivation, which will ultimately improve the performance. moreover, the performance variable shows the average interval value of 2.90 to 3.58, which means the performance of lecturers/employees is good enough. understanding the relationship between culture, job satisfaction and motivation toward the performance will improve the quality of service in universities. this is possible because the leader knows the factors that become the leverages of the performance of lecturers/employees.","culture, job satisfaction, motivation, performance, university",,"linda theresia, a h lahuddin and gadih ranti industrial engineering department institut teknologi indonesia tarlind@yahoo.com, abdulharislahuddin@gmail.com, gadihranti63@yahoo.com ramon bangun faculty of administrative science universitas indonesia bangun66@yahoo.com",
278,Digital Terrestrial Tv In Philippines: What Is In For  The Media Consumer?,"the broadcast industry sector in the philippines is mandated by the government to adopt and implement the digitization of television networks. various networks have conducted studies on technical aspect but not on media consumer’s watching preferences. this paper studied the media consumer’s preference in watching television. a survey questionnaire method was used to determine and identify the preference and significant key factors of the media consumer. socio-economic factors like age group, job specification and financial status have several considerable impacts on digital terrestrial television implementation. preferences on television viewing are identified to come up with a socio-economic business model.","digital television, media consumer, set-top box","Digital terrestrial television technology is now the on-going trend for broadcast communications industry. The evolution has an impact in the aspect of socio-economic for the media consumers. Based on the statistical test conducted using chi-square test there is a significant impact between analog terrestrial TV or digital terrestrial TV for tele-viewers. The assumption points toward the enhanced capabilities of digital television technology to cater the demands of the media consumer and satisfying the preference for TV viewing experience. Significantly, media consumers thought that Digital TV has more to offer in terms of value added services and enhanced viewing experience as compared to analog TV. The result is reflected based on the statistical test conducted above where the media consumers are expecting more with the change in TV medium. Likewise, set-top box or digital receiver is the primary equipment to receive and experience Digital TV in which media consumers based on the age group are willing to buy set-top box to avail the value-added services offered by Digital TV.

In general, based on the results of the statistical analysis of significant relationship among the factors on Digital TV 
awareness and watching preferences; showed a promising future in the TV broadcast industry since the modern media 
consumers are looking for something new to experience where entertainment will be at its finest. Likewise, socio-
economic aspect on financial capability is significantly a factor in digital TV implementation. Efforts from the 
government and various TV networks who already into digital broadcast are needed to fully utilize the emerging 
technology that is capable of upbringing the realized potential of the dynamic television market industry. 
 
6.  Recommendation 
 
Digital terrestrial TV technology is only at the early stages of operation in the Philippines. The study only represents 
a portion of the total nationwide population with stratified sampling in Quezon City. Further studies for large coverage 
areas can be conducted when partial to full digital TV implementation is observed to know the progress of the 
migration plan and when to “analog-shut off “. As mentioned, the study only identified three (3) socio-economic 
factors namely: age group, job description and financial status. Further study can include other economic factors which 
are relevant to the deployment of the digital TV technology. Independent variables can also be modified prior to the 
subject of the study. Media consumer preferences can also be modified. The study can focus from one to two or more 
preference(s) which can be crucial to the operations of a broadcast TV station, to know if it is a significant factor(s) 
to attest. Finally, since digital TV has other platform aside from digital terrestrial TV, further studies can include 
IPTV, cable TV and satellite TV. The study can make a comparison among all other platforms, but since the 
technology is at the embryonic stage, these other platforms are yet to be fully experienced by the media consumers.

E-commerce Performance Indicators consist of 3 constructs and there are 9 indicators for measuring those constructs. Future research is expected to use a variety of methodologies and further research and development on the relationship between SCRM and e-commerce. 6.","abraham stefanus industrial engineering, engineering faculty universitas surabaya surabaya, indonesia askfor9od@yahoo.com markus hartono industrial engineering, engineering faculty universitas surabaya surabaya, indonesia markus@staff.ubaya.ac.id",
287,A Fea-Based Feasibility Study On The  Replacement Of Student Wooden Desks,"deforestation increases the amount of co2 gas in the atmosphere and is also a permanent destruction of forests. according to the united nations' food and agriculture organization (fao), approximately 18 million acres of forest are lost each year. thus, regulations have been placed on forests’ clearance because the loss of forests causes global warming. having identified the severe effects of greenhouse gases on the earth, this paper focuses on finding an alternative material for furniture manufacturing in order to reduce deforestation. with wooden furniture prices increasing due to the regulations limiting deforestation, the effect being significant in the education sector, plastics are studied as the alternative material to classroom wooden furniture. instead of having a desk and a chair, the furniture is designed as a single combined plastic arm chair to save material. a finite element analysis (fea) is carried out on the selected polycarbonate arm chair using solid works, and it is observed that the maximum stress that the arm chair can be subjected to is less than that at which polycarbonate alloy (abs-pc) fails. hence, it is possible to replace classroom wooden furniture with cheap and easy to maintain polycarbonate arm chairs. key words: deforestation, global warming, furniture, fea, abs-pc 1895",,"5.1 Recommendations While it has been concluded that the replacement of wooden classroom furniture chairs with polycarbonate arm chairs is feasible, it can however be noted that wooden furniture remains the strongest as compared to plastic chairs. Hence there is need for reinforcements to be applied to the plastic arm chair in order to try and have it match the strength of wooden furniture. This can be done through heat treatment processes to the plastic that will make it more harder and thus stronger. Other alternative strengthening methods that can be used include the use of metal legs so that the overall force that can be supported by the arm chair is increased. This study used classroom furniture as a case study. Thus, it is important to note that wooden furniture in homes and other typical setups can also be replaced with plastic furniture if the correct studies of determining the forces setup are done. 1905","and chairs with a plastic arm chair. rumbidzai prosper jera university of zimbabwe, department of mechanical engineering, post office box mp167, mount pleasant, harare, zimbabwe rumbidzaiprosperjera@gmail.com tawanda mushiri university of johannesburg, department of mechanical engineering science, faculty of engineering and the built environment, post office box apb 524 bunting road campus johannesburg, south africa tmushiri@uj.ac.za tawanda.mushiri@gmail.com charles mbohwa university of johannesburg, faculty of engineering and the built environment, post office box apk 524 auckland park, johannesburg, south africa cmbohwa@uj.ac.za","References

different combination of large positive numbers in place of 5000 here. The dimension of 
classroom allocation is an important aspect that needs to be taken care of hence. This can be 
done by first obtaining the results of allotment and then optimizing it further on similar lines. 
Heuristic optimization methods are explicitly aimed at good feasible solutions that may not be 
optimal where the complexity of the problem or limited time available does not allow an exact 
solution. Generally, two questions arise related to how fast the solution is computed and how 
close the solution is to the optimal one? The tradeoff is often required between time and quality 
which is taken care of by running simpler algorithms more than once, comparing results obtained 
with more complicated ones and effectiveness in comparing different heuristics. The empirical 
evaluation of heuristic method is based on the analytical difficulty involved in the problem’s 
worst case result. 
Solving Timetable Scheduling Problem by Using Genetic Algorithms: Genetic algorithms are 
adaptive systems inspired by natural evolution. They can be used as techniques for solving 
complex problems and for searching of large problem spaces. Genetic algorithms are belonging 
to guided random search techniques, which try to find the global optimum. Genetic algorithms 
are working with the set of potential solutions, which is called population. Each solution item 
(individual) is measured by the fitness function. The fitness value represents the quality measure

291,A Cloud Based Architecture For Automatic Feature  Recognition In Distributed Manufacturing Environment,"the recent manufacturing encapsulates the globally distributed enterprise resources which requires advanced technologies i.e., internet of things, cloud computing, semantic web and service-oriented technologies to establish the effective global manufacturing network. this hinders issues of heterogeneous product information related to multi-disciplinary domains, which make the knowledge within documents irreconcilable. this paper presents, an automatic feature recognition based cloud service platform for a distributed manufacturing environment, which enables the networks to enhance the interoperability by seamless exchange of information. the proposed architecture acts as an integrated approach that consists of a three layers namely physical resource layer, local server layer, and cloud layer as services to meet the requirements of real time distributed manufacturing environment. moreover, the most effective tools and techniques such as transfer protocols, ontology, heuristics, meta-heuristics, world wide web (www), and extensible markup language (xml) has been used to develop and implement the proposed cloud manufacturing platform. the integrated solution proposed in this paper can push forward this new paradigm from concept to practice for optimal service recommendation.",,"and Future work Recent advances in cloud manufacturing can transform the way enterprises do business. The cloud customers can have access to on-demand services, such as design, production, assembling, testing, simulation, and management. A cloud based automatic feature recognition platform framework has been proposed in this paper for distributed manufacturing environment. To address the issues of heterogeneous knowledge integration, seamless data sharing and interoperability the proposed AFR. In order to make the feature customization easier, the framework separates the feature representation and feature recognition, so that applying changes to feature library will not affect the feature recognition process. Moreover, the deployment of ontology techniques brings a great flexibility for customizing features. Future research interests may extend network level standardization work on product identification numbers, locations, factories, revisions, should be done. Manufacturing enterprises need to develop standard data to support working in distributed production. Performance analysis needed to ensure key functionalities of cloud platform not to show any practical difference in long run. Further, data security remains an important research area related to use of cloud.","y poornachandra sekhar school of mechanical engineering, vit university, vellore, tamil nadu, india nlpoorna321@gmail.com vijay kumar manupati* *school of mechanical engineering, vit university, vellore, tamil nadu, india manupativijay@gmail.com",
292,The Performances Of Process Capability Indices In The Sixsigma Competitiveness Levels,": six-sigma is a powerful business strategy that employs a disciplined approach to tackle process variability using the application of statistical and non-statistical tools and techniques in a rigorous manner. the process quality of six-sigma corresponds to a defect rate of at most 3.4 parts per million (ppm). the applications of six-sigma will continue to grow in the forthcoming years. the six-sigma concept of process capability indices such as cp, cpk, cpm, and cpmk have been considered in this research. it provides quantitative measures of process potential and performance. moreover, based on the “sigma level” the various competitive levels have been categorized as world class, industry average, and non-competitive industry. it aims to identify the firm performance within these three competitive levels at the four process capability indices and see the consequences of these indices. further, it does provide good understanding and foundation for future research. the practitioners and researchers can use the procedure to test whether the processes meet the capability requirement. we plan to undertake the vast study to verify the framework given in the paper.",six-sigma approach,"and further scope of the study When the firm levels move from non-competitive to world class, their cost of poor quality and defect rate decreases while increase the yield improvement. The study identifies the theoretical concepts of firm performance within world-class, industry average, and non-competitive industry over the four process capability indices that evaluate the ability of a process to attain within certain limits. The study of Cp, Cpk, Cpm, and Cpmk to construct with the more desirable capability and increasing higher values such as various range less than 1, equal to 1, range between 1-1.5, and 1.5-2 and greater than 2. After getting the results, use the following table below to present the non-conforming parts per million (ppm) for a process corresponding to Cp, Cpk, Cpm, and Cpmk values. We focus on histograms, control charts and probability plots for defect rate and Cp, Cpk, Cpm, and Cpmk and assess properly. Further, the study will focus when the difference between USL and LSL is very high, low and centered (centering and spread of the process variation). We plan to undertake to explore and verify the framework suggested in this study that will also provide a new dimension to the research. Further, it will definitely provide good insights and many contributions; through the findings and the results of this research which we will do in future.","vimal kumar department of management studies national institute of technology bhopal, india (vimaljss91@gmail.com) pratima verma department of industrial & management engineering, indian institute of technology kanpur, kanpur, india (pratima@iitk.ac.in, way2pratima@gmail.com) vignaesh muthukumaar consultant, exl services, bengaluru, india (vignaeshmk@gmail.com)",
293,Implementation Of Horizontal Strategy For Conglomerate  Firms: The Role Of Five-Factor Model,": the horizontal strategy is recommended for conglomerates by porter (1985) for competitive advantage. the conglomerate firms are categorized as ‘horizontal strategy’ and ‘non-horizontal strategy’ organizations. according to porter (1985), there is no established or standard way to execute a horizontal strategy. however, it requires advanced organizational capabilities to the execution of horizontal strategy in an organization. in this study, we explored the extent to which organizational capabilities were related to the implementation of the horizontal strategy. five novel hypotheses addressing primary constructs, namely, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, openness, and neuroticism are explored in this study. based on 107 responses from firms across various manufacturing and service sectors, the firms are classified as ‘horizontal strategy’ and ‘non-horizontal strategy’. we argue through a theoretical analysis which shows that employee attributes (conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, openness, and neuroticism) will be contributing to the success of the horizontal strategy and lent good support to our hypotheses.","horizontal strategy, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, openness","and Limitations Due to the increasing competition in the business world, the organizations try to sustain their competitive advantage. On the other hand, the firms are focused on competing to survive in a complicated and uncertain business environment. Consequently, the horizontal strategy is provided the ways to generate sustainable value or competitive advantage of the organization. In the study, we considered employee attributes (conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, openness, and neuroticism). Further, the study establishes the theoretical framework between these variables and horizontal strategic organization in conglomerate firms. Based on the empirical investigation and its analysis, the findings suggest that horizontal strategy and non-horizontal strategy groups of conglomerate firms have their different identities. Employee behavior and employee attributes are the necessary things for the success of the organizations so; we can say that positive employee attributes have been considered as valuable keys to focus strategy implementation in any organization. Finally, the hypotheses support to this study that indicates the high score of consciousness; extraversion, agreeableness, and openness to experience are conducive to the implementation of horizontal strategy whereas a high score of neuroticism is detrimental to the performance of the horizontal strategy. The main limitations of this study as the business units have been classified based on the respondent’s response; that raised the doubt about the feasibility of the results. Another limitation of this study is the respondents belong to the top management from different departments of the sample of the conglomerate firms. However, to minimize the biasedness in the responses in the future studies, the data needs to be collected from multiple levels of organization such as bottom level and supervisory level also.","pratima verma department of industrial & management engineering, indian institute of technology kanpur, kanpur, india (pratima@iitk.ac.in, way2pratima@gmail.com) vimal kumar department of management studies national institute of technology bhopal, india (vimaljss91@gmail.com) vignaesh muthukumaar consultant, exl services, bengaluru, india (vignaeshmk@gmail.com) rahul gajbhiye department of management studies national institute of technology bhopal, india (diamondrahul@hotmail.com)",
294,Equal Distribution Of Shortages In Supply Chain Problem Of  Food Corporation Of India,": the purpose of this research is to develop a twin objectives formulation considering cost and back order minimization of supply chain operational problem faced by food corporation of india (fci). cost minimization problem is a standard lp (linear programming) and we consider quadratic objective formula for the back order minimization problem which turns out to be nlp (non linear programming). we attempt solving nlp by langrangian relaxation. in this paper, few computational results have been given for the representative problems such as overall costs and the total back orders. based on the empirical investigation, we discover many solutions which are obtained that make tradeoffs between overall cost and total back orders. in different instances of the problem, the proposed formulation with lagrangian relaxation provides good bound in comparatively less computational time. these solutions are of practical value to supply chain managers. the paper will be helpful to any industry in making good tradeoffs between total back orders and operational costs. there is a variety of different approaches that different constraints of the supply chain problem be relaxed to generate different quality solutions. the research provides insight into the differences in the values of lagrangian relaxation with total back orders and operational costs.","twin objectives, cost minimization","and future research We have proposed a solution set that optimizes both the values when the overall costs decreased then back orders are increased and vice-versa. This optimal solution is getting by using Lagrangian relaxation method. We decomposed the combined formulation into two different subproblems and solved it for different instances. Here the efficiency of decomposition approach for warehouse stages is shown in terms of the time and lower bound for backorder is obtained. In all the different instances of the problem the proposed formulation with Lagrangian relaxation provides good bound in comparatively less computational time. This method is compared to LDR rules (Holt et al, 1960) that it minimizes the quadratic problem statement into a linear function. From the results, we can see that quantity supplied to various big warehouses can be calculated. These values have been calculated considering the given constraints and they minimize the total backorder. For future work, different obstacles are still left, as we have mentioned in the research problem, which can be included in the model. Few of them are: (1) no proper number of warehouses to procure food grain; (2) no circulation of food grains; (3) delay of rail; (4) high lead time; (5) no manpower; (6) gap between planned and actual movement and; (7) poor infrastructure which are faced by FCI as well as Indian Railway. For these, we can suggest FCI and Indian Railway develop the new warehouses at certain places to fulfill the demand of PDS without delay and these changes will give a different feasible solution in order to minimize the wastage of food grain. We propose for future work that different constraints of the supply chain problem be relaxed to generate different quality solutions. These may be compared with Linear Decision Rule type of methodology applied to NLP by Singh (2012). Also, we can change different parameters of LR such as step size; starting values of multipliers, halving of a parameter of LR etc that are making good tradeoffs between back orders and operational cost.","vimal kumar department of management studies national institute of technology bhopal, india (vimaljss91@gmail.com)",

307,"A Review On The Reliability, Availability  And Maintainability (Ram) Approaches In",": this paper critically investigates the various factors which influence the overall availability of the manufacturing plant. it also describes the different ram tools, techniques and methods which are qualitative, quantitative and commercially available software(s) to support ram studies and the integrated current approaches in conceptual process design. a number of concerned literatures taken from the last few decades that provide a detailed survey of topics including reliability-availability analysis methods. in the last section of paper, an attempt is also made to give directive model for research on focused area using an optimal reliability tools under certain resource constraints. key words: ram tools, complex process, decision support system, simulation. 1. introduction: the changing business environment and a long list of failures and associated effects from history sheet drawn the attention of business leaders and practitioners to find the ways of cost savings, revenue improvement, safe and highly reliable quality product available on demand. an estimate says the revenue lost due to unexpected shutdowns of plant can range from $500-$100000 per hour (tan and kramer, 1997). this paper focused on ram tools that include variety of methods, both qualitative and quantitative, and commercially available software supporting ram studies. reliability is the ability of an item to perform a required function, under given environmental and operational conditions and for stated period of time (bs4778,1991). maintainability is the ability of an item, under stated conditions of use, to be retained in, or restored to a state in which it can perform its required functions when maintenance is performed under stated conditions and using prescribed procedures and resources (bs4778, 1991). availability, in general, is defined as the ability of an item to perform its required function at a stated instant of a time or over a stated period of time (bs4778, 1991). plant availability is a function of the reliability and maintainability i.e., a=f(r, m). therefore, it is clear from the definition of availability that a process engineer can improve the plant availability at the design stage by either increasing reliability or maintainability or both. complex systems are characterized by large network of links between components or by statistical dependence between the component states. some typical examples of process industries having complex systems are food, beverage, chemical, pharmaceutical, consumer packaged goods, biotechnology industries, gas-and power-distribution etc(narendra & tewari,2016). 2. literature survey and review in literature a number of review papers have appeared in the last few decades that provide a detailed survey of topics that include reliability-availability analysis methods. poh and liang[2017]developed multiple criteria decision support to build a comprehensive analytic network process model that will adequately capture and reveal all the interrelationships and interdependency among the elements in the problem, which is often a very difficult task. asjad and khan [2016] did thorough analysis of maintenance cost for an asset and applied genetic algorithm to optimize the maintenance cost for higher performance (i.e. availability). ranjan et al. [2015] proposed a competing risk model based on of gamma and exponential failures where the gamma reflects aging failures and exponential corresponds to accidental failures. the proposed model is analyzed in a bayesian framework using markov chain and monte carlo simulation. they concluded that if the failures are dominated by aging, the probability distribution function (pdf) curve of proposed model-s will be closer to that of 2032",,,"conceptual process design narendra kumar and p. c. tewari department of mechanical engineering, national institute of technology, kurukshetra-136119, india narendra_6160054@nitkkr.ac.in, pctewari1@rediffmail.com","REFERENCES

313,Cost Estimation Model Of Structural Steel For Super  Structure Of Wellhead Platform In Oil And Gas Industry,"in this paper, an approximate and quick estimation model is proposed based on engineering oriented methodology to support the existing bidding practice which consumed more time due to material take off (mto) preparation. the cost estimation model is based on standard quantity of structural steel for superstructure/topside which calculated from the mean value of respective steel section and strength classification. 44 offshore structures were collected and analysed for model development and 5 for model verification. 7 steel sections consist of plate, welded tubular, seamless tubular, beam, miscellaneous steel, grating and stair tread with respective strength classification such that high strength, through thickness properties (ttp) and mild strength steel were identified that accounted for overall structural steel costs. the completed cost estimation model were validated through inter-rater agreement between subject matter expert (sme) in the field and verified by comparing the estimated cost calculated by the model and the actual bidding cost. the result showed that the model yield an error range less than +8% and can be considered acceptable in construction of fixed offshore structure.","structural steel, wellhead platform",", this study met its objective to propose an approximate cost estimation model for bidding purposes. Also, this study has accomplished to developed a reliable standard quantity for cost estimation model of structural steel with model validation using inter-rater agreement by experts of Cohen Kappa (value of 0.643) and model verification by comparing model’s estimated cost with actual biding value which generated error range between +7.29& and -1.71%. 6. Limitation There are very limited existing research or study on cost estimation method for oil and gas industry especially on individual discipline such that structural steel. Therefore, the study needed to be started from the ground level. Also, to access financial information is hardly possible for any contractor to reveal their price since the budget are used for bid purpose. Hence the name of contractor/fabricator and the name of bid projects are disclosed to ensure the discretion of bid value. 7. Research Significance and Contribution There is a very limited research on cost estimation in oil and gas industry especially in EPCC Company. Therefore, this study is the first pioneering step towards cost estimation of structural steel for superstructure/topside of Wellhead Platform (WHP) by EPCC contractor/fabricator. The suggested method is expected to be used not only for accurate and quick cost estimation, it also can support to set target cost during early bidding stage as a criterion for management decision the possibility to earn projects based on design results. 8. Future Works For future work identical to this area of study, there are recommendations which can be highlighted to improve or extend the study of cost estimation for structural steel of offshore structure in oil and gas industry. First, the study is only focused on superstructure/topside of Wellhead Platform, excluding substructure/jacket of Wellhead Platform (WHP). For a complete offshore structure of Wellhead Platform, future study can analyse the trend or pattern of structural steel weight for substructure/jacket to identify the standard quantity and propose an approximate cost estimating model for substructure/jacket to be used for bidding purposes. Secondly, future works can also focus on heavier structure such as Central Processing Platform (CPP) which can range to 18,000 MT to 22,000 MT for both topside and jacket. Using similar methodology, standard quantity for structural steel can be identified. Hence, an estimation model of structural steel for superstructure/topside and substructure/jacket of Central Processing Platform can be established.","ahmad ammar luqman abdullah1, syed ahmad helmi1,2, aini zuhra abdul kadir1, muhammad hisjam3 1faculty of mechanical engineering, universiti teknologi malaysia, 81310 johor bahru, johor, malaysia 2center for engineering education universiti teknologi malaysia, 81310, johor bahru, johor, malaysia 3department of industrial engineering, faculty of engineering, sebelas maret university surakarta, indonesia",
314,System Dynamics Approach To Supply Chain Performance  Measurement In Small And Medium Enterprise,"the concept of supply chain management has today become a tool that both manufacturing and service organizations have been using to help win greater market share. small-medium enterprises have found it difficult to measure their performance due to the complex external environment. in this paper, analysis of a single case study of an sme through survey and interview is done in order to measure the performance of its responsive supply chain. a system dynamics modeling approach is used to model the variables that have greater influence on the performance system through the development of a causal loop and stock and flow diagrams. comparisons of the experimental results shows that the domestic purchase of the raw material and quality efficiency will help to reduce the future lead-time and import requirements which will help the company to achieve product availability which is the main competitive strategy of a responsive supply chain.","supply chain, system dynamics","This study has investigated that domestic purchase of the principal raw material (cocoa powder) and producing quality products will help to reduce the lead-time by making products available at all times meeting customer demand, which is the main focus of a responsive supply chain and hence will improve the performance of the company. This study did not focus on cost involved in making the supply chain of the company responsive. From the analysis of the questionnaire, it is gathered that the lead-time, quality and product availability are the three main order winning strategies of the customers of the company. Most Small and medium sized companies do not have an effective or a performance measurement system due to the fact that most cannot identify their internal strength and weaknesses but more focus on external opportunities and threat. There are lots of competitors in the beverage market in Malaysia who are also trying to gain greater market share by producing quality products to the customers and also trying to make products always available. Therefore since the case study company has identified the various strategies they can use in winning customer orders, they must strive to be efficient and effective in their activities. In trying to purchase a raw material locally which is the best decision, the case study company needs to have good collaboration with its supply chain partners so as to integrate well to enhance on-time delivery. The use of IT in planning the operations of suppliers and customers in terms of deliveries is very important in a responsive supply chain.

320,Ergonomic Analysis For Musculoskeletal Disorder  Prevention Of Workers In Operation Prepare Room,"the surgery-room is one of the key medical care locations in hospitals and tools and material have prepared in the operation prepare room. the people of surgery team are medical doctors, nurses and assistants. nurses, the majority of the team, have complained musculoskeletal disorder (msd) problems. these problems originate from multiple factors. in this study, ergonomic analysis has been used to evaluate risk factors of musculoskeletal disorder. the objective is to estimate the risks of nurses and to redesign the tool carriage in surgery rooms. the subjects are the nurses at surgery rooms in a university hospital. the ergonomics analysis of nurse work was processed in the hospital. not only professional observation has been done, but also camcorder and camera recorded key activities. the results of ergonomic job analysis and questionnaire show that muscle disorders are very common symptoms of low back; the results of checklist shows that the nurses and assistant people are under high musculoskeletal disorder or injury risk. the new carriage is suggested to reduce the problems of surgery tool lifting and moving. the layout of surgery rooms and preparation room should be redesigned to increase productivity and reduce lifting and moving activities. to provide standing-chairs and to train nurses with valid postures are recommended to decrease nurses' musculoskeletal disorders.","ergonomics, nursing, operation room",,chih-wei lu chung yuan christian university taiwan chwelu@cycu.edu.tw,
321,Palm Oil Plantation Revitalization Model  For The Agroindustry Development,"the increasing need for vegetable oil about 5 million a year accompanied by the human population growth with the average increase 0.9% requires a consistent effort for indonesia as the largest cpo producer in the world. the efforts to increase the palm oil plantation production faces not only the constraint of the low plantation product but also the lack of downstream palm oil industry development, in addition, there is not any special fund for the plantation. for that reason, it is necessary to make an improvement effort for the revitalization of the palm oil plantation in north sumatera-indonesian through the big potential benefits of north sumatera by modelling palm oil plantation revitalization, to facilitate the relevant parties to find the solution of the constraints of palm oil plantation revitalization so that it can support the cpo agroindustry development in north sumatera. the implementation of palm oil plantation revitalization in north sumatera is very low, that is only 17.5% out of the planned one. it indicates that it becomes the constraint of the palm oil plantation revitalization in north sumatera. the result of the research shows that several dominant factors influencing the success of the revitalization are among others the land availability and the replanting, the increased productivity of plantation and cpo agroindustry, and the plantation financing. therefore, it is recommended that the relevant parties such as government, plantation companies, banks and-and farming community be able to synergize so that various influencing factors can be optimized and the increase in the revitalization is maximized",palm oil,,"juliza hidayati departement of industry engineering, faculty of engineering universitas sumatera utara, medan -indonesia email: julizausu2307@gmail.com; rivaijuliza@gmail.com sukardi departement of agriculture industry technology bogor agricultural university, bogor - indonesia ani suryani departement of agriculture industry technology bogor agricultural university, bogor - indonesia anas miftah fauzi departement of agriculture industry technology bogor agricultural university, bogor - indonesia sugiharto pt pertamina (persero) jakarta -indonesia",
322,Lean It Adoption: Success Cases In Portuguese Banks  Cátia Lobato Ferreira,"lean it emerged as a fusion between information technology (it) and lean thinking. this paper aims to contribute to a better understanding on how lean thinking may be applied to the it sector, through the study of the outcome from the application of lean it in two portuguese banks. the paper will analyse how the lean it approach addresses the challenge of increasing competitiveness; analyse the lean it implementation methodology adopted by the 2 banks; and how are the banks maintaining the lean it approaches. the implementation process was surveyed through a series of interviews which uncovered differences in terms of lean it practices and tools used by both organisations. empirical evidence made clear that the lean it adoption by the banking institutions made them more competitive. moreover, it was also important to notice that lean it became part of the organisational culture thus justifying its permanence. this research shows examples on how the use of lean it may help other organisations become more agile and valuable to their customers, thereby, increasing their competitiveness.","lean it, waste, it models","Over the years, Lean has been adapted to several activity sectors, allowing a better understanding of different realities. Starting in the automotive industry, it then moved on to other sectors such as: construction, process industry, retail and distribution, financial services, healthcare and information technology. Each sector is defined by different types of stream value and all the knowledge that may be obtained from those sectors is relevant to adapt Lean to the IT industry (Bell S. , 2013). It is therefore possible to apply Lean to any organisation and system, as long as there is a product or service flow that can be driven by the client/ user demand (Hicks, 2007). Lean IT is still underdeveloped in Portugal, namely the adoption of its principles by organisations. Nevertheless, it was interesting to see how Lean is applied to information technology and how it is useful for organisations, as it generates benefits that maximize their effectiveness and efficiency. Through key performance indicators it was identified, in both cases, an increase of 20% in their effectiveness and efficiency and thus in their competitiveness. Despite the challenges of implementing Lean IT, these bank institutions were able to embed it in the organisational culture and therefore they are still maintaining Lean IT. Due to the relevance of the present study and because it is not yet developed by most Portuguese companies, it would be interesting to extend it to a significant sample through the application of questionnaires to other companies. This would allow a better nationwide understanding of the application of Lean IT.","departamento de engenharia mecânica e industrial faculdade de ciências e tecnologia, universidade nova de lisboa caparica, portugal csl.ferreira@campus.fct.unl.pt maria henriqueta almeida departamento de engenharia mecânica e industrial and unidemi faculdade de ciências e tecnologia, universidade nova de lisboa caparica, portugal mh.sousa@campus.fct.unl.pt antónio grilo departamento de engenharia mecânica e industrial and unidemi faculdade de ciências e tecnologia, universidade nova de lisboa caparica, portugal acbg@fct.unl.pt",

324,Head And Face Anthropometric Measurements For Saudi  Arabian Females,"the study reports face and head anthropometric measurements for saudi arabia females’ population. face and head measurement change with time due to environmental and geographical factors. there are many applications relying on this measurements such as face masks, head masks, glasses, respirators, helmets, clothing, medical and dental fields and plastic surgeries. there hasn’t been any study on facial and head measurements on saudi arabia, therefore this study is considered as a reference and foundation for saudi head and face measurements. the data is presented in a standard anthropometric format.","face and head, 2009","Face and head anthropometric measurements for female Saudi population are presented. The data represent a population from 5 different regions of the country with age ranges between 18 to 65 years old. It was found that all face measurements are not affected with age and region differences. The data were combined for all measurements across all ages and regions and presented in a standard anthropometric table. The data was limited due to budget constraints and cultural values that limit number of volunteers. However, it is believed that this work is the first to report face and head measurements for female with this wide age range. The intension is to have a starting point for collecting body sizes especially for females in the country. The data is presented in a standard anthropometric table to assist in designing products that matches Saudi’s females face sizes and eliminate any potential hazard or inconvenient as a result of mismatch between their sizes and products’ sizes. 2183","abdalla alrashdan, aisha alkaff and shatha khamis industrial engineering department alfaisal university riyadh, saudi arabia aalrshdan@alfaisal.edu, aalkaff@alfaisal.edu, skhamis@alfaisal.edu","References

325,Formulation Of Lignin Based Surfactant Using Extracted  Lignin From Ultrasound-Assisted Technique For Enhanced,"surfactant are some of the most expensive chemicals used in enhanced oil recovery (eor). thus, the reason of developing lignin based surfactant system for eor is to lower the cost as it does not tie to the price of crude oil compare to other petroleum based surfactants. besides, lignin could be extracted from oil palm waste that is available abundantly in malaysia. the aim of this study is to determine the amount of lignin compound extracted from the oil palm empty fruit bunch (efb) by using ultrasound-assisted technique, to determine formulations of lignin based surfactant for eor applications, and to determine the oil recovery performance of lignin based surfactant through surfactant flooding. the results of the study showed that the extraction of lignin using ultrasound-assisted technique enhanced the extraction amount of lignin, though it did not alter the lignin composition and structure, compared to traditional pulping process. the formulation of lignin based surfactant at 2 % total active surfactant showed good stability phase behavior and interfacial tension. the oil recovery from displacement test also showed significant results where the best formulation lignin based surfactant able to recover 11% of oil originally in place (ooip) after waterflooding, and is comparable to commercial surfactant.","extracted lignin, ultrasound, surfactant","The extraction of lignin using ultrasound-assisted technique does not alter the lignin composition and structure. This finding agrees with other researches by Nazir et al. (2013), Fahma et al. (2010), Mason et al. (2011), Yunus et al. (2010), Garcia et al. (2011). In addition, ultrasound-assisted technique enhanced the extraction amount of lignin compared with traditional pulping process (Ibrahim & Azian, 2005) and is supported by similar finding from Alriols et al. (2008), Nazir et al. (2013), Mason et al. (2011), Garcia et al. (2011). The formulation of lignin based surfactant at 2 % total active surfactant showed good stability phase behavior and IFT.

326,The Role Of Information And Communication Technology In  Construction Risk Management,"the lifecycle of a construction project would start with the need for a new facility by an owner. therefore, the construction projects are known for having unique characteristics, which stem from the diversity of the owners’ needs. the vast amount of the projects’ components is usually undertaken in uncontrollable environments. the unique nature of the construction industry makes it risky and competitive endeavor. one of the critical competitive advantages for a construction organization is its ability to implement the previous experience and to maximize the organizational learning. this would aid the construction organization to manage the expected business risk effectively. information and communication technology (ict) can provide efficient tools for adequate risk management process that would lead to successfully managing and responding to project risks. this paper is part of an ongoing research that aims to study the available ict tools and techniques and discuss how the ict would facilitate the success of construction risk management process. the main objective of the ongoing research is to reveal the areas where these tools and techniques can be implemented and its anticipated effectiveness if it were applied appropriately. the current paper discusses briefly the scope and the expected benefits from the study.",risk management,"and Recommendation This paper is presented under a preliminary comprehensive research that focuses on the role of ICT in promoting for successful implementation of the risk management into the construction industry. Revealing the expected rewards would promote for implementing ICT into risk management, the feasibility for investing in the offered software and information systems need to be further investigated. The literature discussed both barriers and drivers for implementing the ICT in the construction process. It was found that the involvement and support of the top management is the most critical factor that would promote for ICT implementation. The ICT barriers include: high cost, complexity, business culture. On the other hand, the foreseen advantages for implementing ICT in the risk management process include: increased productivity, improved communication, integrated project information, more efficient decision-making process, controlled project performance.

328,Human Risk Factors And Road Accident Causation Among  Motorcyclists In Malaysia: A Review Article,"road traffic accidents involving motorcyclists have increased steadily over the years in malaysia. the causation of road traffic accidents is normally related to individual and environment factors. therefore, this review aims to identify human risk factors for road traffic accidents among motorcyclists in malaysia. we conducted a systematic review on the following electronic databases: scopus, wiley online library, emerald, web of science, google scholar and malaysian institute of road safety research (miros) from 1970-2017. a total of 1369 titles were identified and following the screening and review processes (i.e. title screening, abstract screening and full text reviewed), only four studies were included. results showed that motorcyclists’ traffic violation behavior is the main risk factor that contributes to road traffic accidents. this review paper helps to provide an understanding of the role of human factor contributing to road traffic accidents in malaysia. it is suggested that an effective road safety campaigns could help in reducing the number of road traffic accidents in the future. more studies are needed to provide a better insight on the risk factors that lead to road traffic accidents.","accident causation, human factors, traffic violation, motorcyclists","Human factors are indeed played a significant role in explaining the occurrence of traffic accidents. Although there are other contributors such as the technical and environmental aspects, it was evident that human factors alone contribute 80% of the road accident causation in Malaysia (Lee, 2015). As compared to drivers unintentional mistake of slip and lapse, the intentional traffic violation behavior is more significant and becoming the leading factor that cause road accident in Malaysia. As can be seen from the findings, motorcyclists committed some traffic violation behaviors like over speeding, tail tailing, dangerous overtake, run over red light, drink and drive, taking drug, disobey the traffic signage, not stop at the stop line, use of mobile phone while driving and eating while driving. This violation behavior is among the highly risky behavior that can lead toward road accident causation. In addition, motorcyclists and drivers who fail to use helmet and seat belt will eventually put them in the severe traffic accident (Ambak et al., 2010). This review includes data which was gathered from an observation and by interviewing road accident victims. It therefore provides a clear understanding of the risk factors of road accidents’ causation among motorcyclist. The data was gathered from the firsthand experience of road accident victims and in a natural setting. This review paper has several limitations, as the focus of the study is only investigates the accident risk factors among motorcyclists. Therefore, future studies should also address the accident risk factors among other road users such as the car drivers, truck drivers and bus drivers. Moreover, the other limitation is, there is only one cross-sectional study that used respondents of actual road accident victims. Thus, the data gathered might not be comprehensive and conclusive because it involves the general public’s perception rather than real experience. It is recommended that, future study should engage actual accident victims. Apart from that, it is also highly recommended for the future study to investigate other factors such as the role of attitude in explaining the road accident causation. As a conclusion, this review has provided a summary of human risk factors that can contribute toward road accidents among motorcyclists in Malaysia. Motorcyclists’ violation behaviour emerged as the main risk factors that contribute toward road accident. This information provided crucial use data for the local authorities such as the Malaysia Road Transport Ministry, Polices Department, MIROS and other related parties to develop the most suitable education and road accident prevention plan in the future. Apart from that, based on this review, it can also be identified that there is a limited number of studies about accidents involving motorcyclists’ in Malaysia. Therefore, this review paper will help to provide to date discussion regarding motorcyclists’ road accidents risk factors and add a new source of literature to the body of knowledge.","siti hawa harith faculty of management, universiti teknologi malaysia johor, malaysia school of business management, universiti utara malaysia kedah, malaysia sitihawaharith@gmail.com norashikin mahmud faculty of management universiti teknologi malaysia johor, malaysia norashikin@management.utm.my",
329,Analyzing The Impact Of Human Characteristics On The  Comprehensibility Of Road Traffic Signs,"traffic safety is one of major challenges facing most communities worldwide. to improve traffic safety, regulating traffic movement through markings, signs, channelization, and others is essential. traffic signs are used either to regulate road user movements by highlighting priorities or to inform road users about traffic regulations and traffic conditions. in general, traffic signs are essential element in road operation. thus, understanding these signs by road users is of prime importance for efficient and safe traffic operations. this study investigates the comprehensiveness of traffic signs by drivers and the impact of driver characteristics gender, nationality, age, language, and educational level. clarifying the correlation between the understanding of traffic signs and driver characteristics will yield to recommendations and help in identifying proper countermeasures to enhance the communities’ knowledge of traffic signs and consequently improve traffic safety level. the study used an electronic survey as a research instrument for data collection. the results have shown significant impact of some of human characteristics on their ability to recognize the metal-plate and electronic traffic signals.","traffic safety, traffic sign, driver gender","This study mainly investigated the comprehensibility of a selected sample of traffic signs by drivers in the State of Qatar. The study shows that the average comprehensibility of all traffic signs is 80.9%. Moreover, the correlation between different human characteristics and the comprehensibility of traffic signs was studied. In this study, we could not identify different performance between static and variable message signs. In average 20% of the drivers fail to respond correctly to at least one of signs. This ratio is quite high and alarming especially with such simple, basic, and common traffic signs. Furthermore, it is important to remember that more than 70% of the drivers are fresh drivers with less than 5 years driving experience with good 2217","nazha r. ghadban qatar transportation and traffic safety center (qttsc), qatar university, doha – qatar ng1104186@student.qu.edu.qa galal m. abdella department of mechanical and industrial engineering, qatar university, doha – qatar gmg5005@qu.edu.qa wael alhajyaseen qatar transportation and traffic safety center (qttsc), qatar university, doha – qatar wyaseen@qu.edu.qa khalifa n. al-khalifa qatar transportation and traffic safety center (qttsc), qatar university, doha – qatar department of mechanical and industrial engineering, qatar university, doha – qatar alkhalifa@qu.edu.qa","References

334,Proceeding Of The International Conference On Industrial Engineering And Operation Management  The Influence Of Internal Auditors And Organizational,"this study examined the effect of employee perceptions about the role of internal auditors, justice organization with a code of conduct companies as moderating variable on the prevention of fraud through the perception of employees. the population in this study were employees working at pt jaya konstruksi mp, tbk. purposive sampling method used in this study were employees of a permanent employee status, education minimum diploma 3 to tier 2 and the length of at least 2 years working in the company. in this study, there are several tests used are validity test that uses corrected item-total correlation, reliability test that uses cronbach alpha and test the hypothesis by using the coefficient of determination (r2), f test, t test and regression analysis using moderated regression analysis (mra). the results of this study indicate that 1) the role of the internal auditor has an effect on the prevention of fraud; 2) organizational justice has an effect on the prevention of fraud; 3) the role of internal auditors is reinforced by the company's code of conduct has an effect on the prevention of fraud; 4) organizational justice is reinforced by a code of conduct companies have an influence on the prevention of fraud as well; 5) the role of internal auditors and justice organization that is reinforced by the company's code of conduct has an effect on the prevention of fraud.",fraud prevention,"Based on the results of research and discussion about the regression model analysis of the influence of the role of internal auditors, justice organization and code of conduct of companies to the prevention of fraud. Variable research is the dependent variable, namely the prevention of fraud, the independent variable is the role of the internal auditor and justice organization and moderating variable that serves as a quasi moderation is the code of conduct of the company. Based on the results of this research can be concluded as follows: 1. Based on the results of testing the first hypothesis we can conclude the internal auditor's role and significant positive effect on the prevention of fraud. The results support the research Taufik (2010) which states that the internal auditor's role is very influential on the prevention of fraud. 2. Based on the results of testing the second hypothesis we can conclude positively influence organizational justice and significantly to the prevention of fraud. The results support the research Herman (2013), Fitrianisa (2014) and Cristofels (2010) which states that justice influential organizations on the prevention of fraud. 3. Based on the results of the third hypothesis testing, code of conduct the company can influence the internal auditor's role in the prevention of fraud. So we can conclude a code of conduct companies able to moderate (strengthening) the relationship of the internal auditor's role positively and significantly to the prevention of fraud. 4. Based on the results of testing the fourth hypothesis, the code of conduct can influence organizational justice to the prevention of fraud. It can be concluded the code of conduct of companies able to moderate (strengthening) the relationship of the internal auditor's role positively and significantly to the prevention of fraud. 5. Based on the results of the fifth hypothesis testing, code of conduct could affect the company's internal auditors and the role of organizational justice simultaneously. So we can conclude the company code of conduct able to moderate (strengthening) the relationship of internal auditors and the role of organizational justice positively and significantly to the prevention of fraud. 2286","justice with company code of practice as moderating variables against fraud prevention through employee perceptions in pt jaya konstruksi manggala pratama tbk luqman hakim, m.si doctoral program of the finance management faculty of graduate studies university mercu buana jakarta, indonesia kapluqman@gmail.com sabil, se, mm doctoral program of business management pancasila university jakarta, indonesia sabil.sbl@bsi.ac.id",
335,"Benefits Of Green Buildings  Elizabeth Ojo-Fafore, Clinton Aigbavboa And Pretty Remaru","the bitter experience of global warming has alarmed and compelled the mankind to change the way they operate on earth. within the construction industry, the green building concept evolved and it is now gaining momentum rapidly across the world. green building involves a building which incorporates environmental considerations into every stage of the building construction with the objectives to protect occupant health, improve employee productivity, use wisely natural resources and reduce the environmental impact. this paper investigates the benefit of green buildings in johannesburg using a detailed questionnaire. the study findings revealed that green buildings provide better health for building occupants due to the improved indoor quality, development of more energy efficient products and the use of less natural resources for the satisfaction and welfare of building tenants, also to protect the ecosystem. the outcome of this research shows that green building benefits should encourage clients, consultants and contractors invest in green buildings.","benefits, buildings, conventional, green","From the survey obtained from the respondents, literatures reviewed and the cas studies, green buildings provide better health for building occupants due to the improved indoor quality, lead to the development of more energy- efficient products and services increase luxury, satisfaction and welfare of building tenants ,improve the value of lifetime for individuals, the ecological and emissions costs are lower ,enjoy the support of climate change protocols and uses less natural resources and so as to protect the ecosystem, Economic life of green building is extended , to the reduction of annual water cost savings were identified as the top ten benefits of green buildings in Johannesburg. It can, therefore, be concluded that clients, contractors and consultants need to take consideration of the benefits of green buildings and start investing in green building construction. This study will bring more alertness to the public about the benefits of Green Buildings and why we need green buildings. Despite data limitations and the need for additional research in various areas, the findings of this research point to a clear conclusion: building Green building is cost-effective and makes financial sense today.

337,Leadership Style And Employee Turnover Intention  Geeta Ann Sulamuthu,"the trend of employees leaving a company and recruiting of new employees has become a global issue in many organizations worldwide. this recurring situation, know as employee turnover, has brought to the concern of human resource managers, especially in asia and malaysia is no exception to this perturbing situation. high turnover rate is considered a major disadvantage to any organization considering the cost of replacement and work disruption. losing good employees can negatively affect an organization’s competitive advantage, lowering the morale of other staff, as well as reducing productivity and work quality. several factors contribute to the employee’s decision to leave a job. they include management, organizational configuration, an employee’s attitude and potential, external job demands, employee’s own assessment of job related organizational decision, pay, job satisfaction, experience in the organization, job enrichment, job stability, job prospects, pay compensation, social support of the supervisor and organizational politics. these strong factors may cause behavioural inclination that influences the evaluation of one’s job satisfaction to remain in the organization hence. thus, his paper tries to explore a possible factor that can give significant impact to turnover intention of employees in an organization. base on a review of the literature, majority of the studies had identified a negative relationship between leadership style and employees’ turnover intention in various fields of industries. the objective of this study is therefore, to investigate the implication of transformational and transactional leadership styles on turnover intention.","leadership style, 2013",,"faculty of management universiti teknologi malaysia 81310 skudai, johor, malaysia gann2@live.utm.my / geetario9280@gmail.com halimah mohd yusof faculty of management universiti teknologi malaysia 81310 skudai, johor, malaysia halimahmy@utm.my",
338,Leadership Style And Employee Engagement  Geeta Ann Sulamuthu,"retaining employees in an organization has become a growing challenge for most corporations in current modernized world. ironically, the turnover among employees is prevalent within the well-educated and highly skilled employee group. retaining optimistic staff with excellent job performance is important for the growth of the organization as turnover of critical employee is deemed as major hindrance to the development of the organisation in relations to cost of replacement and work disruption. in this competitive world, retaining admirable workers is essential because losing them can disrupt an organization’s competitive advantage, lowering the morale of other staff, as well as reducing productivity and work quality. lack of social support of the supervisor is a major reason for employees leaving an organisation. having engaged employees results in greater profitability, shareholder returns, productivity and customer satisfaction. transformational leaders are motivating leaders who initiate their subordinates by empowering the identification of the group members with each other and with the organization, and by instilling hope, trust, optimism, and positive emotions. the absence of positive support and motivation from their superiors contribute to employees’ decision to willingly leave their jobs. this paper tries to explore a possible factor that can give significant impact to employee retention in an organization. based on the literature review, studies conducted on different fields of industries, revealed that there is existence of a positive relationship between leadership style and employee engagement. thus, the objective of this study is to investigate the implication of transformational and transactional leadership styles on employee engagement to foster employee retention.",leadership style,,"faculty of management universiti teknologi malaysia 81310 skudai, johor, malaysia gann2@live.utm.my / geetario9280@gmail.com halimah mohd yusof faculty of management universiti teknologi malaysia 81310 skudai, johor, malaysia halimahmy@utm.my",
339,Measuring Robustness Of Water Distribution Networks  Using Informational Entropy,"researchers are recognizing that the robustness evaluation of water distribution networks (wdns) is of great importance for reducing the impact of disruptive events. yet, very few methods to measure the robustness of wdns have been developed. these methods mainly focus on topological attributes and fail to provide a comprehensive picture of the robustness characteristics of wdns. the work described herein proposes a new robustness index to measure the heterogeneity of wdns drawing on informational entropy theory. the paper attempts to shift away from an exclusive topological viewpoint or a pure hydraulic approach, towards a combined topological and hydraulic analysis. the main emphasis is on the influence of an individual node on the overall network performance. the use of the proposed index is illustrated with a real-world wdn of an australian town. the results highlight the significance of integrating the topological and hydraulic metrics for a reliable assessment of robustness in wdns.","degree distribution, demand fraction, robustness","The method described herein represents a new step toward measuring the robustness of WDNs. The authors advocate the idea that the behavior of a network can be characterized by assessing the influence of each individual node in the network (Singh et al., 2015). Different authors have developed topological perspectives to evaluate the robustness of complex networks by assessing the influence of individual nodes. The present research emphasizes that persistent focus on topological properties fails to realistically measure the robustness of WDNs. To remedy this weakness, rooted in entropy theory, a new robustness index is proposed, which combines the topological and hydraulic attributes of the network. The proposed index not only explores the structural heterogeneity of the network by using an entropy-based degree distribution metric, but also incorporates the demand fraction entropy which accounts for the hydraulic attribute of WDNs. This integrated approach yields more useful insights to evaluate the robustness of WDNs in comparison with the conventional approaches. The paper posits the informational entropy theory as a tool to measure the robustness of WDNs. The work also measures and analyses the robustness of a network from the character of its heterogeneity (Wang et al., 2006). On this premises, the joint entropy of degree distribution and demand fraction is employed to measure the network’s heterogeneity, which in turn can be interpreted as the measure of robustness. The entropy-based analysis reveals that a uniform demand distributed network with diversity in its degree distribution is less heterogeneous and thus exhibits more robust behavior against random failure of its nodes. The use of the proposed index was illustrated with a real-world case study. The paper compared the effectiveness of the demand fraction entropy-based metric with the degree distribution entropy-based metric. The numerical results confirmed that the nodal degrees in WDNs span over a small range of values, consequently the degree distribution entropy-based metric is not informative enough and therefore stand-alone use of this metric hinders a reliable assessment of the robustness in WDNs (Giustolis et al., 2017). Though the degree distribution and demand fraction are good indicators of topological and hydraulic (respectively) performance of WDNs, these metrics don’t entirely characterize the structural and hydraulic behaviors of the network. Further research can build upon our current study by incorporating more topological (e.g. centrality measures) as well as hydraulic (e.g. pressure head at nodes) metrics into our method. Furthermore, since nodal demands are one of the main sources of uncertainty in WDNs (Sanz and Perez, 2014), it would be helpful if future research could engage in reducing the uncertainty in model outputs induced by uncertainty in nodal demands. The authors believe that the robustness evaluation of WDNs requires incorporating more factors than is presented in this paper and hope the current study further encourages researchers to develop more innovative methods.","seyed ashkan zarghami faculty of professions university of adelaide australia indra gunawan associate professor in complex project management director of project management program entrepreneurship, commercialisation and innovation centre university of adelaide australia frank schultmann professorship of business administration karlsruhe institute of technology (kit) australia",

345,Performance Of Class Aggregation In A  Multiple Class Inventory Rationing Problem,"researchers have shown that inventory rationing is possibly the best technique to deal with inventory systems with multiple demand classes, ordering the same product. the classes are prioritized based on the penalty cost of not fulfilling a demand immediately upon arrival. in order to fulfil the demand from different classes, the system rations inventory using a critical level policy in which each class has a critical inventory level associated with it. under this policy, when the inventory is below the critical level for that class, the demand for this class and all the lower classes is backordered. deshpande et al. (2003) showed that inventory rationing performs better than other policies for 2 demand classes. what happens when there is more than 2 classes? do we really need to consider multiple classes? in this presentation, we, numerically, investigate the impact of collapsing a 5-demand class system into a 2- class system by aggregating several demand classes together and present our findings. 3340",,,sugoutam ghosh singapore university of social sciences singapore,
346,A Conceptual Framework Of Risk Identification  For Scale Up Companies In Transition Period,"within an entrepreneurship ecosystem companies are divided in three phases of development: startup, scale up, and unicorn. this paper addresses the scale up phase and focuses in a bottleneck of transition stage from startup to scale up and consider various challenges from point of view of risk management. this research presents a risk identification framework based on some best practices. the method proposed is supported by established risk management concepts that can be applied to help scale up companies to gain awareness of the risks especially during transition period. this paper contributes for research on entrepreneurship’s risks by applying risk management for transition performance of scaling up companies by identifying the relevant risk factors that should be considered. subsequently, these risks should be evaluated in order to executing proper actions. in addition, it gives to entrepreneur’s insights on how the adoption of the growth will affect the enterprise scaling, and how it can increase the assurance of transition stage. the paper concludes with a summary of key ideas and promising directions for future work.","entrepreneurship, risk management, start up, scale up","This research investigated the possibility to utilize risk management in identifying the risks of transition stage of scaling up companies. A state‐of‐the‐art literature review was performed to establishing the context as first step in a risk management process. The main objective was to find a risk classification as best practices that should be managed to obtain the relevant risk events and risk consequences that support the development of a risk model focused on the integration of best practices and risk profile attributes. For this purpose, the authors have applied eight classes of hurdles during scaling up period as a basis of risk categories because of being relevant and comprehensive in explaining the research problem. Briefly, it has presented a pragmatic risk registry that can be used to identify risks in scaling up firms. Noticeably, identifying the risk is just the first step of a risk formwork and it is important to complete the risk assessment process and risk treatment as well. In the future researches, the authors are looking to investigate these steps and presenting a more complete risk model and also using “empirical examples” of actual companies to study and demonstrate the core constructs and ideas.

347,Techno-Economic Modeling In Advanced Ceramic Materials  Manufacturing Using Spark Plasma Sintering Technology,"prior to commercializing a product of interest, techno-economic principles are used to determine viability of the process flow. the aim of this paper was to conduct a desktop research on the process flow of interest (the technology and the raw material of interest) using techno-economic approach thereby determining the commercializing a product. as much as silicon nitride based materials that are sintered through the application of spark plasma sintering sps technology have grasped the interest of researchers for commercial possibilities, a techno-economic study of commercializing silicon nitride based materials using sps technology was not found during the desktop research. the results obtained indicated that there is a common agreement among authors about techno-economic application. it was therefore concluded that techno-economic approach/ principle(s) can be used to determine the commercialization of any product.","techno-economic, spark plasma","According to the techno-economic literature review in this paper a desktop research was successfully conducted. It is therefore concluded that the economic viability of manufacturing/ commercializing silicon nitride based material using SPS can be determined by the application of techno-economic principles without the aid of software(s), unless software’s are used for simulation purpose. As much as the raw material is of economic concern in techno-economic, Silicon Nitride was found to have suitable properties of interest for military, medicine, and automotive industry application. It is also concluded that the questions of interest were answered in statements made by different authors presented in Table 1. 6.","mmakwena. c tsipa and mukondeleli. g kanakana department of industrial engineering tshwane university of technology pretoria, 001, south africa tmktsipa@gmail.com, kanakanamg@tut.ac.za","References

349,Measurement Of Innovation Performance In Selected  Industries In Sultanate Of Oman,the aims of this research are to benchmark individual innovation excellence and performance of innovation indicators in selected industries in oman. it also identifies the emerging trends of innovation across various types and sizes of industrial sectors (both manufacturing and service) in oman. the methodology adopted to conduct this research was mainly case study along with quantitative analysis. this article presents the initial results from an ongoing research project and future research will carried out to get the actual results.,"innovation, indicators, performance, case study","Innovation is an important factor of keeping performance of firms improving. In addition, it is one of the main reasons of getting competitive advantage in the market. In industries, cost is a critical consideration and need to be monitored along with the profit gained. Innovation practice helps increasing the profit incrementally. Measuring innovation is a one way of rising the awareness of innovation benefits. However, Omani industries lagging behind in this field due to different reasons like the lack of specialties in this field. Also, the absence of measuring format that can evaluate the level on innovation practice then provide the appropriate action to identify the reasons and start solving them. The aim of this research was to understand the current situation of innovation practices in Omani industries, identifying drivers and barriers in order to improve the economic situation to end with designing or improving an index of innovation practice in Oman. As we have noticed that innovation index has to contain the three pillars of innovation, which are product innovation, process innovation and service innovation. Due to these aspects, questionnaires SMEs and large industries will prepare, and relevant data must be collected from different selected industrial sectors in Oman (e.g. product design, manufacturing, sales and service). In future, the work will continue to identify the indicators which are drivers and barriers/bottleneck of innovation based on the result of the questionnaires. In addition, the collected data will be analyzed using descriptive statistic tools and to develop and construct the innovation index for Oman industries for measuring the level of innovation in both SMEs and large industries and compare the results. It is hoped that the future research outcomes will provide guidelines for conducting and reaching sustainable innovation. 2371","ahm shamsuzzoha, mahmood al-kindi and emad summad department of mechanical and industrial engineering sultan qaboos university muscat, sultanate of oman ahsh@squ.edu. om, kindim@squ.edu.om, esummad@squ.edu.om","References

Furthermore, a complex decision making processes considering the static and dynamic characteristics of each agent is included. The results from estimated values is promising. However, due to time-related difficulties in data acquiring the model is not yet adapted to the real world values. This paper covers only the building- up of an agent-based model for a development in the past. This model was not yet employed for forecasts or marketing mix analysis. These are possible topics for further research.

353,Towards A Characterization    Of Cross-Border Banking Supervisory Systems:,"the internationalisation of banking operations has significantly contributed to making the supervision of cross-border banks much more complicated not only at a national level but at a regional level as well. the main purpose of this paper is to take a first step towards a characterization of cross-border banking supervisory systems to help design and manage them successfully following an integrated and holistic approach, including a description of processes covering the regulation, supervision and resolution of financial systems and the linkages between the key different processes. this paper constitutes a compilation of literature’s review on cross border banking supervision. the results collected through a general review of the available literature and the case study of the moroccan banking supervision framework attempt to outline the possibility of proposing a supervisory system organized around key macro-processes. the first part of the paper presents an overview of cross-border banking. the second part describes the supervisory system adopted in morocco as an emerging country and highlights the processes set up within the different agencies constituting a whole system to be monitored in an integrated way to ensure the same shared objective which is none other than the financial stability.",,"and future work Following what have been described above, it appears that to ensure the financial stability while maintaining adequate balance with the other policies, the supervision at micro and macro levels of banking activities, insurances and securities must be conducted in an integrated way, as part of an interrelated system, which still remains a very critical mandate, complicated and challenging especially with the cross border side of the regional and international banks operating abroad. The future work, aiming to enrich the expanding literature and dealing with a not yet exhausted theme, should focus on the characterization of a whole supervisory system based on a risk approach, the breakdown of this system into components interconnected in a complementary way, the description of the underlying processes and the definition of key performance indicators at both operational and strategic levels to set up an effective and global monitoring system.","case of morocco as an emerging country abdelilah harrat, abdelaziz berrado research team amips university mohammed v in rabat ecole mohammedia d’ingenieurs rabat, morocco aharrat@gmail.com, berrado@emi.ac.ma",

356,Page 1 Of 14,"this paper aims to provide an approach to jidoka (machine's autonomation) implementation via compute the proficiency value that based on processes' deviation monitoring to besiege any defects chance weaken competitiveness. the product produced after operating multi-surface spaces (oss), which prone to deviation during its processes and may lead to defect. the proposed methodology interested in controlling processes' deviation via improving the spatiotemporal model with sarima via using 72 observations to study and predict the deviation's behavior to stop machine before defect appears (i.e., jidoka methodology). a case study of the manufacture of a lawn mower (carburetor's valve) is presented to explain the jidoka methodology results that demonstrate it accurately and effectively, whether in forecasting or defect suppression to face the evaporative emissions. the approach is guided by a six-sigma methodology to obtain improved proficiency. the model’s fitting and forecasting results are compared with the ses to prove the ability of applying jidoka. the proposed methodology implemented in one of the lawn mower co. egypt, which gain defect reduction by 0.7 % or rescue 7000 product every one million via sarima(1,1,1)x(0,1,1)6 to improve the spatiotemporal methodology. key words: jidoka, machine controlling, arima model, deviation forecasting 1. introduction egypt participated in the climate conference with the aim of providing industrial solutions to reduce the problem of global warming. the political will decided that the beginning was to control the quality of products that might cause the problem via its evaporative emissions to reduce the pollutants. this agreed by the industrial engineering goal in proposing means of quality control to achieve this goal. the evaporative emissions of a volatile fuel reduced via controlling in carburetor's valve actuation device, which prohibited the fuel flow in its paths, prelude to drained during engine shutdown [8, 18]. therein lays the importance of manufacturing this valve with minimum deviation or errors. since the end of the 19th century, the evaporative emissions is in top of manufacturing agenda to reduce the global warming phenomena, which caused via manufacturing a bad carburetor valves in its compressor [24]. therefore, the design of these valves have subordinated to continuous improvement methodology [22] to emissions suppression to become no-contaminant. the higher proficiency is related with designs that have minimum deviations, which calls for develop and accurate prediction methodologies. the evaporative emissions influenced by valve's unit of compressor shown in figure-1, which may be divided to three units, the motor, piston/cylinder unit and valve unit, which concerned for verifying the proposed prediction manufacturing methodology. it is extremely difficult to develop a zero defect in manufacturing process in a high-volume environment, which has many manufacturing processes for each part. the continuous monitoring is a viable option via ability to predict how a part manufactured [3]. the spatiotemporal monitoring procedures [2] aided with arima will improve the production planning [20], fault finding and improve proficiency. the processes' capability index is a common standard parameter illustrates the quality level, but it's not sufficient in human intervenes [1]. therefore, the proficiency index is suggested to measure the efficiency plus effectiveness of the machines and laborers together. the deviation measurement is done after finish every step in the studied process's and hope for do that during process progresses in the future without stopping. the lawn mower compressor as illustrated in figure-1 consist of a piston moving back and forth in a cylinder, with suction and discharge valves and cause evaporative emissions in failure function [18] due to a bad manufacturing especially in holes radius or thickness dimensions. the suction and discharge valves open and close due to pressure differences between the cylinder and inlet or outlet manifolds respectively. proficiency is important issue in top agenda of manufacturing process for quality improvement. because it concerned with main objective, which is producing good product from first time and every time that may be difficult and costly without machine's autonomation approach. while jerky demands (i.e., small different orders) become marketing features [10]. every stage of products' operation is confronted with numerous errors happening every time [11] and this has brought a big trouble for defect suppression. many new types of defects striving appear in egyptian corporates via deviation control. so in this way, accurate deviation forecasting is desired. any product consists of many operating surface spaces (oss) that based on many sequential processes, (i.e., ∑ . each of them ∑ . in this paper presents the autonomation via 1 corresponding author email: idealstandarddeviation@gmail.com fig.1: the side view section of lawn mower compressor 2436",,"In this paper, time series model of SARIMA is used to make short-term forecasting of deviation behavior aided for spatiotemporal for selected part in specific product share in global warming phenomena in Egypt. The fitting and forecasting results are compared with the other forecasting tool (SES) as illustrated in Figure-24. The result shows that STAM fits the data well and makes higher accurate forecasting than the other model. This work is proved to be very helpful to the quality department in improving the efficiency of decision-making and emergency management. This paper presented a general framework for the statistical modeling of spatiotemporal count data. There is nothing special about deviation events, and early experiments using our methods to forecast 311 (calls for non-emergency services like potholes) have been promising. In the application of this framework, a series of modeling decisions which would be worth exploring in more detail in future work was made. The use of spatiotemporal leading indicators—other deviation (errors) types, weather patterns, other events measured online or offline—might provide measurable improvements in our forecasts. Table-3 illustrates the comparison between proposed methodology and recent reported results using SES statistical models [1, 12, and 14] is also needed.

357,Life Cycle Assessment Of Rice Processing  S. Kamalakkannan,"rice is the staple food in sri lanka. the impact of the rice mills to the environment is considerable issue currently. the rice production process consumes energy, water, bio mass and other environmental resources and adds air and solid emissions, effluent and wastages back to environment which cause environmental impacts. it is very clear to understand that the large amount of energy consumption, waste water and solid waste to the environment and the very large capacity machines and engines used by the mills are the causes behind the issue. therefore, the total environmental effect of each and every step in the life cycle of the production process needs to be considered in order to identify the most environmental friendly rice production method. mainly the parboiling and polishing processes are associated with harmful environment discharge such as emission to air, fossil fuel and affect the natural resources. therefore, proper environmental management practices need to be sustained in the rice production industry. the objective of the research is to evaluate the environmental impact through the life cycle of rice production in sri lanka. based on lca approach (iso 14040 series), the environmental impacts by the rice industry was analyzed. the impacts on environment was assessed through “simapro” software. the results interpreted that the most harmful processes among the rice production are the parboiling and polishing process.","rice processing, tradition","The efficient utilization of energy is a great challenging task to the researchers. The rice industry is one of the most energy consuming industries. Saving of husk could also lead to co-generation of thermal energy in furnaces for boilers and dryers in the rice industry. Thus, energy conservation in the rice industry would lead to reduction in the use of electricity for parboiling process. According IPCC 2007 GWP method, the parboiling process plays a significant role in rice industry. While comparing both rice mills results, RAYIN rice mill generates more global warming potential due to the electricity usage. Electricity generation has become a major impact in generation process. ECO indicator 99 implies that the impact from parboiling and polishing processes, in which the first is deemed to be the major contributor with significant impact, highly affect the environment. Among the impact categories, the Human health and Eco system are which is mostly affected by parboiling process and the Resource category is mostly affected by Polishing Process. Specifically, the parboiling process leads the impacts to environment. In total, parboiling and polishing are the most influencing processes towards the environment respectively.

362,Towards Sustainable Society: Design Of Food Waste  Recycling Machine,"qatar is one of the top 10 countries in the world in terms of per capita food waste; which ranges from 584 to 657 kilograms per year. the combination of high food consumption rate and very low food waste recycle rate, results in mountains of food dumped into landfills where they get burned and therefore produce harmful gases. in this paper, we are introducing a practical solution for every household to recycle the food waste instead of sending it to the landfill. the solution is to design an eco-friendly machine that converts food waste to fertilizer. the use of recycled food waste as compost improves the soil health and structure, increases drought resistance and reduces the need for supplemental water, fertilizers and pesticides. the composting process is fully automated, it consists of several steps under controlled environmental conditions (i.e. temperature, humidity) to fasten the process. a mechanism is designed to reduce food waste volume by over two-thirds. also, experiments were conducted to figure out the best conditions of temperature, moisture content and the bulking agent that would result in a high- quality homemade fertilizer within hours. the aesthetics aspect was considered by designing an elegant and socially accepted machine with a suitable size to be placed in any kitchen.","recycle, composting, food waste, design","All in all, this paper aim is to show the importance of recycling food waste and helping the environment by building a machine that converts food waste into compost. The machine is completely manufactured in Qatar. This food waste recycler machine is to be built and used at home safely. The design methodology and the engineering solutions that will be used in this project were explained in the engineering design process. Followed by the identifying the customers, knowing their needs and taking their feedbacks, which are considered important since our purpose is to satisfy the customer’s needs. Furthermore, a quality function deployment was used to translate customer needs into design specifications. In addition, the external and internal constraints and the design standards were identified. Moreover, the conceptual design for the machine, the design alternatives, alternatives evaluation, and the machine’s final design all were discussed briefly and shown in detail in this paper. Since the world is seeking sustainability, our machine aims to lessen the food waste that is thrown into the landfills, which pollute the environment by recycling the food waste and turning it, in less than 24 hours, to compost that can be used in fertilizing the soil to plant healthy and organic food, and contributing in creating a safe and sustainable world. 2506","shada bennbaia aseel wazwaz alaa abujarbou sb1209176@qu.edu.qa aw1403927@qu.edu.qa aa1304940@qu.edu.qa dr. galal m. abdella dr.farayi musharavati gmg5005@qu.edu.qa farayi@qu.edu.qa industrial and mechanical engineering department qatar university, doha, qatar","References

The proposed indicators were developed using Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) methodology. A hierarchical structure of AHP was mainly formulated to identify the necessary composition and rating them. For this purpose a set of steps were conducted in applying the AHP methodology for the purpose of identifying and rating of the indicators. The results of the study show that leadership/management commitment is the most important criterion which is followed by strategic quality planning and recognition and reward. The indicators generated through this study allow the organizations to assess their quality progress based on the proposed factors of the organizations. Through rating the current level of quality performance organizations can actually get a quick overview on where they are in their quality journey to excellence and where improvements need to be made. The proposed AHP model and its methodology will hopefully provide guidance to organizations for measuring quality and business excellence performance. The importance weights also can be used for assessing the quality performance. In this manner the indicators for each criterion must be defined with their importance weight.

371,Study To Design And Develop An Entrepreneur Model:  Perspectives From Tannery Industry In Oman,"tannery industry is considered as one of the major growing business segment around the world. this industry occupies a promising place in the global market place due to its enormous export, growth and employment opportunities. in oman, currently there is no tannery industry, which can be established with the objective to diversify its economic growth outside mostly oil-based industry. this study therefore, explores an opportunity to design and develop of an entrepreneur model from the perspective of tannery industry in oman. in order to develop such entrepreneur model, necessary data were collected from various regions within the sultanate of oman. in addition to develop such the model, this study also considered the total leather production system starting from collecting the raw materials to all stages of treatment and finally physical distribution to the market. 1. introduction tannery industry commonly known as leather industry is considered as one of major industry around the world. the leather industry occupies a promising place in the global economy in the perspective of its enormous export, growth and employment potentials (gangi and timan, 2013). for maximizing the returns and improving the utilization of the raw materials, there needs strategic planning and development of this industry. there are many definitions for the leather tanning process, which carry the same goal. according to wikipedia: “tanning is the process that converts the protein of the raw hide or skin into a stable material, which will not putrefy and is suitable for a wide variety of end applications”. on-the-other-hand, the columbia university press defines it as a process by which skins and hides are converted into leather. therefore, tanning is the process through which rawhides and skins are converted into leather as a final usable and sellable product (nazer et al., 2006). it is used as the basic raw material for the production of various leather commodities (i.e. shoes, bags, etc.). actually, there is no absolute procedure for the leather production. raw material (hides, skin) and the final product needed decide on which techniques to be used (zhang et al., 2016). there are several techniques of tanning but the most common are chrome and vegetable tanning (4). the tanning process usually passed through several steps, which can last from as short as a few minutes or hours to as long as several months for some kinds of vegetable tanning techniques. the term ‘ hide’ in the tanning industry is used for the skin of large animals (e.g., cows or horses), while skin is used for that of small animals (e.g., sheep). hides and skins are mostly by-products f r o m t h e slaughterhouses, although they may also come from animals that have died naturally or been trapped and hunted. tanning industries are usually located near the regions where high amount of raw material is available. however, hides and skins may be preserved and transported prior to tanning (balkau and scheijgrond, 1996; sumita et al., 2015). this research study explores the idea to establish leather industry in oman. in this avenue, the paper explores the possibility of establishing complete leather industry in oman from collecting the raw materials and ending up with commercial leather products through all stages of treatment and finally physical distribution to t h e market. since 2553",,"This project attempted to identify and design an entrepreneur model for tannery industry in Oman, which gives a value added benefits for unused hides. Establishing such new idea and find the opportunity for tannery industry in the market will have a good impact to the community. In addition, the project will open new horizon for this local industry. It will help Omani government's quest to find an employment opportunities for Omani youths. Tannery industry has undeniable advantage for the country, where there are human labor force, sufficient water and abundant raw hides and skin. The industry will become one of the sectors significantly supporting economic development of the nation by generating foreign currency and employment opportunity for the citizens and locals. This project can offer a chance to open another related business industry in Oman like factories, which are using the treated leather to produce other products, which can be exported to outside Oman and consumed in local market. As tradition, people disposal the animal hides by throwing it away which leads to harm the environment (Dettmer et al., 2010; Crudu et al., 2014). Therefore finding a way to recycle the leather will reduce the pollution and will have a good impact on the environment. However, tannery industry includes environmental issues associated with leather tanning and leather finishing with respect to wastewater, emission of pollutants in the air, solid waste and hazardous materials. Therefore, there is a need of additional study to overcome issues of hazardous waste that is a byproduct of tannery industry. 2562","ahm shamsuzzoha1, mohammad khadem 1, and sujan piya1 department of mechanical and industrial engineering sultan qaboos university, muscat, oman 1 corresponding author","References

The high risk factors are: 1) The risk of unclear contract financing system can hamper the execution activity of the work; 2) The risk of uncontrolled budget due to lack of sound economic considerations; 3) The risk of late completion of the project due to late payments made by the owner; 4) The risk of obtaining IMB if it violates central government regulations. 4) From final validation by experts, preventive and corrective actions taken from sub-activities with high risk factors to develop a design and build contract management system that has the most influence on the emergence of a dispute-based claim in a mixed use building project based on the Contract Management Body of Knowledge .","on standard contract management body of knowledge evelyn monica thamrin and yusuf latief civil engineering department university of indonesia evelynkonek@yahoo.com, latief73@eng.ui.ac.id",
373,The Integrated Academic Information System Support For  Education 3.0 In Higher Education Institution:,"the industry involvement in the higher education institutions (heis) has been existing for a long time ago. somehow, the involvement was passive and mostly touched the strategic level such as curriculum development. after the industry suggested the curriculum development, they can’t actively check the implementation of the curriculum. they only can check the curriculum result after the students graduated on a recruitment process. in the education 3.0, industries are encouraged to involve more active in the learning processes. therefore, this research explores deeper from the industry and suggested the solution from industry’s perspective and combined with the information technology capabilities owned by the heis. the research used a case study method and conducted a qualitative research with a semi-structured interview. the interview analysis has found that the industry can’t actively involve because they didn’t have access to the learning processes. therefore, this research suggests providing access for the industry in the integrated academic information system (ais), since the integrated ais has covered the e-learning and academic performance during the semester. with the access, the industry can actively involve and collaborate in the learning processes and also can choose the prospective candidates before they graduated.","ais, education 3.0, hei","The analysis of the interview data has been revealed some interesting facts. The industry has the same point of view and nearly matched with the concept of Education 3.0, even the industry did not aware that the concept of Education 3.0 is existing. The facts proved the concept of Education 3.0 very suitable for 21st-century education from the industry’s perspective. Furthermore, the suggestions from industry were aligned with the characteristics of Education 3.0, especially the industry involvement characteristic. The analysis result of SIAk UNLA can be used as a guide for the AIS to support the implementation of Education 3.0. The future involvements suggested by the industry can be supported by the AIS. The AIS can provide the access to the student’s achievement and portfolio. With the access, industry can more active to collaborate with the HEI. Moreover, since e-learning was actively used in Education 3.0 concept and some of the student’s achievement and portfolio were stored in the e-learning, this research suggests to integrating the AIS and e-learning system. The integration will be useful to provide more comprehensive data. Finally, the research suggests to the HEI for preparing the tidy procedures before providing the access to the industry. The HEI must be aware of confidentiality and reliability. The tidy procedures can guide us to identify what kind of data can be shared or not shared. Furthermore, since the users of the AIS will increase time-by-time, therefore the improvement of hardware capability and internet bandwidth capacity must be considered wisely.","industry’s perspective abdul talib bon department of production and operations management universiti tun hussein onn malaysia batu pahat, johor 86400, malaysia talibon@gmail.com hadi prasetyo utomo and mokhamad hendayun department of informatics, faculty of engineering university of langlangbuana bandung, indonesia hadi@informatika.unla.ac.id, hendayun@unla.ac.id",
374,Physician Engagement: A Key To Purchasing Excellence In  Healthcare Supply Chains,"improving hospital supply chain performance has become increasingly important as healthcare organizations strive to improve operational efficiency and reduce cost (chen d q, et al, 2013). existing research highlights that internal integration of organizational functions is not only expected to enhance performance but also makes external integration with the supply chain more beneficial (schoenherr & swink, 2012). but surprisingly, there is a strong indication that firms and its supply chain managers emphasise more on external collaboration than on collaboration with internal partners and business units (poirier, 2008). the profound influence of physicians in healthcare organizations is a big challenge in various supply chain initiatives for the firm’s managers. there is often some disconnect between those who make the buying decisions (physicians) and those who actually perform the buying activities (purchasing officers) (stark & mangione, 2004; ford & scanlon, 2007) emphasising the criticality of involving and engaging physicians in purchasing & supply management processes. this paper identifies collaborative mechanisms, termed as ‘physician-engagement in purchasing’ that would reduce the physician- manager disconnect by fostering the coexistence of competing logics of both actors and thereby allowing health care organizations to redirect physician’s autonomy and knowledge towards improved performance of purchasing and supply management. the paper defines physician- engagement in purchasing at two levels, task and organizational and further examines the moderating effects of physician-engagement on the positive relationship between strategic purchasing and performance. key words: health care supply chain, physician-manager disconnect, physician engagement. 2589",,,"shijith kumar p m, ie business school, madrid and visiting faculty, amrita school of business, bangalore nambiar.shijith@gmail.com maria sabastin s. department of management amrita vishwa vidyapeetham, bengaluru, karnataka, india s_mariasabastin@blr.amrita.edu, ssebastin@mites.amrita.edu aksharaa s department of management amrita vishwa vidyapeetham, bengaluru, karnataka, india akshara.s156@gmail.com alisha mohan department of management amrita vishwa vidyapeetham, bengaluru, karnataka, india mohanalisha39@gmail.com",

378,Fatigue And Human Errors Analysis In Petrochemical And  Oil And Gas Plant’S Operation,"human errors were attributed as one of the main causes of many industrial incidents and accidents in work place particularly in petrochemical, oil and gas plant’s operation. one of the main contributors of human errors is fatigue, and fatigue occurred either due to insufficient sleep or disruptions in normal sleep cycle. ultimately, the shift workers has high tendency to experiences fatigue due to shift rotation. petrochemical, oil and gas plant adopted shift work schedule to ensure the continuity and to optimize the utilization of workforce. it is critical to analyse the relationship between fatigue and human errors to prevent accident/incident at workplace. a combination of quantitative and qualitative research was conducted using questionnaires for collecting primary data and a survey of literature related to fatigue and human errors for collecting the secondary data. the study was carried out to investigate the possible types of human errors and their causes that lead to incident/accident in petrochemical, oil and gas plant’s operation and to evaluate the relationship between fatigue and human errors. sample was taken from shift worker of operation team that consist of field operators, dcs operators and shift controllers. the study results demonstrated that there is a clear link between fatigue and human errors, human errors prevention done by preventing the fatigue. there are four types of human errors were investigated (lapses, slips, mistakes, and procedure violation). fatigue can be prevented by modifying the working hours, reducing working hours, improving the working environments (lighting, display, noise, colour similarity, appearance similarity), simplifying the tasks, proper ratio between manpower and workload. the responsibility to manage fatigue should be taken by both employers and employees.","human error, fatigue, shift work, petrochemical","All in all, the research results displayed very clear links between fatigue and human errors for shift worker in petrochemical, oil and gas plant’s operation. Prevention of human errors can be done by reducing fatigue. Fatigue can be reduced by modifying the working hours, reducing working hours, improving the working environments (lighting, display, noise, color similarity, appearance similarity), simplifying the tasks, proper ratio between manpower and workload (tasks). The practical implication to organizations, the findings suggest that company needs to provide training or workshop about fatigue and human errors preventions to shift workers on how effectively to maintain the fitness of shift worker, modify the existing working environments, job characteristics, having a proper manpower planning to ensure proper job and worker ratio. On individual level, the findings provide insights to shift workers, health and safety professional, students, the impact of shift rotation, circadian factors, time since awaking, sleep quality, sleep quantity, and sleep disorder to fatigue and human errors.","made mariana, taufik roni sahroni and talitha gustiyana industrial engineering department, binus graduate program bina nusantara university jl kh syahdan 9, jakarta 11480, indonesia made.mariana@binus.ac.id , taufik@binus.edu, talitha.gustiyana@binus.ac.id",
379,Developing Performance Measurement System Of  Management  Maintenance In Government Building,": development of construction in indonesia per annum to increase. however, not in line with the normative basis of maintenance, impact on the acceleration of damage to building construction. the purpose of this paper is to identify the key aspects of performance measurement for maintenance management building, objects within parliament building and environment indonesia, to improve the quality of performance.the study was conducted qualitatively, by analyzing data on the perception of the questionnaire to the respondents who had experience in the project, and then the data were processed by structural equation modeling (sem) to get priority indicator factors. the study results showed that there were 63 events of the indicators which were identified as potentially dangerous, and 29 dominant indicators that affected the measurement performance. furthermore, the results of the study are expected to improve the performance management and maintenance more efficiently and improve the economic, techical, social and environmental value.",developing,"Indonesia has high number of poor maintenance management building. Some aspects should be considered when selecting the maintenance management system strategy. First, it is stated that the system developed and presented here is shaped and influenced by the author's opinion and level of knowledge. In order to provide a comprehensive system to the fullest extent possible, steps are taken to consider as many systems as possible. Next Step maintenance managers are the people who use the most systems and they also know the maintenance operations as well as possible. Therefore they are in a good position to determine which indicators will be useful in maintenance management. They are accustomed to such systems today and therefore it is difficult for them to see other possibilities than they are already used. To obtain an overview of broader maintenance performance indicators in the MPM system formulation process, EN 15341 (CEN, 2007) or SMRP Good Practices (SMRP, 2011) main indicators of maintenance performance are considered key sources for formulating performance indicators. Based on these findings, we hope the theoretical basis that has been exposed and conducted further analysis, then obtained the initial hypothesis of research that is by conducting the development of maintenance and maintenance management system will improve the performance of maintenance and maintenance of government buildings in the parliamentary environment of Indonesia.","epo ilham ajiprasetyo1 and yusuf latief1 1faculty of engineering, universitas indonesia kampus baru ui depok, jawa barat – 16424, indonesia *epo.ilham@gmail.com, phone: +628112281993",

Advances rate allowed us to analyze the reliability of distribution mode. We conclude that the mode applied is a pushed-flow, is too standard, and does not take into account the differences between drug categories and irregular drug consumption, or the storage space available at care units. Such functioning, which lacks flexibility, is detrimental to the supply chain of medicines, it favors breaks as well as overstocks. The implementation of the personalization approach for medicines distribution requires certain conditions, mainly the training of human resources, ie preparers and nursing leaders, which must lead to the appropriation of the system by these actors, because without their involvement reconfiguration can not succeed. The adaptation of the storage rooms of medicines, the resizing of the storage drawers must be done according to the endowments of each drug, this dimensioning is to be reviewed periodically according to the evolution of the consumption.","ibn el farouk imane laboratoire d’etudes et de recherches en sciences economiques et de management, lersem. universite chouaib doukalli encg, el jadida, morocco imane-ibn-el-farouk@outlook.com jawab fouad laboratoire de recherches en management international techniques de décisions et logistique (midlog) est universite sidi mohamed ben abdellah fes/ morocco jawabf@gmail.com arif jabir equipe de recherche modélisation et optimisation des systèmes industriels et logistique ecole nationale des sciences appliquées université abdelmalek essaâdi tétaoun, morocco arif.jabir@gmail.com",

389,Estimation Of Conditional Value-At-Risk Under Assets  Liability Model With Non Constant Volatility,"this paper analyzes the risk measurement using cvar when return follows the liability asset model with an unstable volatility approach. an unstable flat model is estimated using arma models, and the volatility model is not constantly estimated using garch models. the surplus return is estimated using the asset liability model. the prediction value using flat models and unstable volatility, is then used to determine the mean and variance of surplus returns that follow the asset liability model. next, the average value and the variance of surplus returns are used to determine the magnitude of var and cvar of each surplus return. the results of var and cvar calculation of surplus return can be used as information in considering investment risk policy on each assets and liabilities analyzed.","arma model, garch model","In this paper we have performed an analysis of Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) under the asset liability model with unstable volatility. The data used in the analysis covered the prices of INDF, LSIP, HDMT, UNTR, and BBRI assets. While the liability price data used is generated simulation, this is because the data liability used in the analysis here is not obtained. From result of analysis, surplus return 1 S has an estimator S CVaR the lowest for any condition value of significance level c =10%; c =7,5%; c =5%; c =2,5% and c =0,5%, followed subsequently by surplus returns 2 S , 3 S and 5 S . While the surplus return 4 S has an estimated value S CVaR much higher.

390,Branch And Bound Algorithm For Finding The Maximum  Clique Problem,we present a branch and bound algorithm for the maximum clique problem in arbitrary graphs. the main part of the algorithm consists in the determination of upper bounds by graph colorings. using a modification of a known graph coloring method called heuristic greedy we simultaneously derive lower and upper bounds for the clique number.,exact algorithms,"Based on the review of various algorithms, in the view of exact solution of MCP, further enhancement may be done by applying better coloring algorithm to estimate upper bound. In the view of local search technique, we can see that hardly a algorithm dominates on all other algorithm, it is because of diverse structure of graphs. One possible way to overcome this deficiency may be to incorporate multiple search operators within a single algorithm and incorporating dynamic capability to decide the most permissible operators to be triggered during the search process. The use of branch and bound method is advantageous, because it provides an alternative perspective to solve the maximum clique problem, as well as the optimal method of solution requires no software optimization. Branch and bound method has been used to the search the maximum clique problem. To determine the chromatic number (G) of a graph G has been sought by the greedy heuristic, chromatic number (G) is the upper bound (UB) on G and by branching procedure obtained lower bound (LB) is the maximum clique (G) on G. Results of the maximum clique the search also shows that the maximum clique (G) is less than or equal premises chromatic number (G).

392,Optimization Of Urea Solution Tie-In System In The Urea  Fertilizer Manufacturing,"this paper develops a mathematical economic optimization for urea solution tie-in system in the urea fertilizer plant. the urea solution tie-in system can be used as an effective strategy to increase the urea production and the company revenue as well. the relevant data for the model are obtained from pupuk kaltim fertilizer company in indonesia. the mathematical formulation of the model is solved using the general algebraic modeling system (gams) software. a sensitivity analysis has also been conducted on the optimal solutions of the model. it is concluded that, with the present model, decisions can be made with different strategies and their influence on company revenue. furthermore, this model will be highly useful for corporate decision making to achieve maximum profit while meeting certain production targets.","modeling, optimization, urea tie-in system, fertilizer","The urea solution tie – in or integration system has an important role in integrating the five urea plants in Pupuk Kaltim which can be optimized to achieve a maximum profit by utilization of the urea solution distribution. A superstructure optimization model has been developed to determine the optimal urea solution distribution path for production of urea prill and urea granule that gives a maximum net profit. Optimization results show the optimized path of utilization of urea solution when the selling price of urea prill is higher than urea granule is achieved by sending the urea solution to the urea prill plants to maximize the urea prill production and then the remaining urea solutions are sent to the urea granule plants with a lower operating cost. The findings of the sensitivity analysis reveal that the selling price of urea products (prill/granule) is very sensitive and show significant influence on both optimal distribution path and the objective function value. When the selling price of urea prill is higher than urea granule, the maximum net profit is achieved by sending the available urea solution to urea prill plants to produce urea prill up to the maximum capacity of the plants before maximizing the urea granule production. On the other hand, the urea granule plants will be at its maximum production capacity when the selling price of urea granule is higher than urea prill. However, since all urea prill plants have a lower operating cost compared with the urea granule plants, maximizing the production of urea prill become the most profitable option to increase the profit margin. Furthermore, the cost of urea solution will also affect the distribution of urea solution to certain plants which ultimately result in higher economic benefits. The developed optimization framework in this study is recommended to be practically used in the corporate decision-making process with the goal of optimizing the urea production and maximizing corporate profits. For future work, it is recommended to extend the modeling framework to perform the analysis of the operating cost of urea production and the cost of urea solution. These parameters are directly related with the utilization of urea solutions in obtaining the optimal distribution path. The improvement in these parameters can further increase the economic benefits while increasing the productivity of the urea plants.

394,Qualitative Characterization Of Geotextile Material For  Downhole Application,"there are various methods available to control sand production from oil and gas wells, among them is through the application of downhole screen. however, conventional screens have their own operational issues such as erosion due to production of fines through the screen openings leading to development of localized high-velocity hot spots in the screen filter media and subsequent failure of the media. the aim of the present work is to investigate the chemical resistance and temperature stability of geotextile material as screen filter media through exposure to reservoir fluids and temperatures. limited studies exist on examining geotextile material as screen filter media as its applications generally revolves around civil, coastal and marine engineering. in this study, woven polypropylene and woven polyester geotextile samples were selected and exposed to crude oil for a period of 1 to 5 days through immersion test and temperatures ranging from 150°f to 219°f through thermal stability test. the samples were then analyzed and characterized by the use of analytical equipment such as energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy and scanning electron microscope to observe deformation after the exposure. results revealed that the test samples were remained in their original state and did not degrade after the treatments.","sand production, sand control, geotextile, polypropylene","This paper presents a qualitative characterization study of geotextile samples after being immersed in crude oil and exposed to reservoir temperatures to study its chemical resistant and thermal stability. Woven polypropylene and polyester geotextile samples have been used in this study. The samples were immersed in Tapis crude oil solution for 5 days at room temperature and exposed to different ranges of reservoir temperatures. The test samples were then analyzed using SEM to quantify its molecular surface structure and EDS to identify changes in the material constituent components before and after the experiments. The SEM images of geotextile samples from thermal stability test show that both polypropylene and polyester samples did not deform after being heated at 150°F to 219°F. The post-experiment samples appear to be similar with the unexposed samples indicating that no deformation occur on the test samples. The SEM images of geotextile samples from immersion test also show that both polypropylene and polyester samples remain unchanged after contact with the crude oil for a period of 1 to 5 days at room temperature. The EDS results of polypropylene samples from immersion test show presence of 100 wt % of Carbon (C) element from a test period of 1 to 4 days except for polypropylene samples immersed for a test period of 5 days. The EDS results reveal the presence of 0.1 wt % of Aluminium (Al) and 0.1 wt % of Silicon (Si) and the remaining is C component after the 5 days. However, it is believed that the changes in the percentage of constituent components may not be due to polymer degradation but due to present of contaminants in the crude oil.

395,The Impact Of Sand Particle Size And Velocity On Sand Erosion  Of Stainless Steel Plate Using Sand Blasting Technique,"economic considerations determine the selection of low-cost steel material such as carbon steel in oil and gas industry. however, there are situations where carbon steel is replaced by stainless steel especially when encountering aggressive brines that contains weak acid such as acetic acid. stainless steel is known for its corrosion resistance. however, the erosion resistance of stainless steel is not well understood. the purpose of this paper is to investigate the effect of sand particle size and velocity on the stainless steel erosion rate using sand blasting technique. scanning electron microscope and universal scanning probe microscope were used to evaluate the erosion on the surface of the plates. the experimental results revealed that larger sized sand particles and higher gas flow velocity caused more severe erosion on the surface of the plates. the severity of the treated stainless steel plate was represented using the uspm cross sectional micrograph. the medium sized sand particles can cause 25o deep crater compared to fine sand with only 7o deep crater. besides, high sand impact velocity of 22 m/s caused more erosion of 13o depth in the uspm cross sectional micrograph compared to 17 m/s which causing 7o deep erosion in the uspm micrograph.","sand impact erosion, stainless steel, sand size, sand velocity","This study investigated the effect of sand particle size and velocity on the erosion of stainless steel plate using sand blasting technique. The effect of particle size on the stainless steel erosion was elaborated in two sand particle sizes: medium sand size (63 µm to 150 µm) and fine sand (<63 µm). It was found that the bigger the sand, the more severe the erosion caused on the surface of the facilities and equipment. USPM micrograph results show that the erosion caused by medium sized particle was deeper compared to the erosion caused by fine sand (25.1o and 7o respectively). Apart from that, the sand particle accelerated at 22 m/s eroded the stainless steel plate more severely compared to the particle hitting the stainless steel surface at a velocity of 17 m/s. The USPM cross sectional result shows that higher velocity sand, 22 m/s can erode the stainless steel 13o deep compared to 17 m/s sand particles which eroded the stainless steel plate with only 7o.

396,Design Of Hybrid Solar Tobacco Curing System For Small  Scale Farmers In Zimbabwe,"the study investigated the prospects of incorporating solar thermals together in conjunction with existing traditional sources in the curing of tobacco. field work was done to assess current practices by small new tobacco farmers and the average space sizes of barns they were currently using. effort was made to utilize solar during the day for this process, to reduce on coal/wood consumption rate. the research went on to look at the sizing of the solar field, and environmental impact assessment on the current curing barns of zimbabwe. key words tobacco curing, solar thermals, hybrid system, environment, sustainable energy 1.introduction according to the international journal of agriculture innovations and research tobacco curing accounts for 5% of africa’s total deforestation, 12% of deforestation in southern africa, and 200 000 hectares of forest are cut down each year for tobacco production. the majority of this (69%) is used as fuel, whilst the remainder (15%) is used for constructing barns and racks, including those used for air cured tobacco which does not require fuel. zimbabwe is ranked the fourth leading producer of high quality flue-cured tobacco which constitutes 64% of all tobacco grown worldwide. the use of energy with less impact to the environment is required to assist in the preservation of the environment. the use of petroleum, coal and natural gas resources as energy sources is limited, and hence it is unsustainable. the gases produced by the burning of fossil fuels have a negative impact on the environment as they contribute to global warming.the current burning of fossil fuel like coal and firewood in a tobacco curing barn in zimbabwe emits carbon dioxide (co2). it is against this background that a feasibility study of tobacco curing using clean sources of energy which are safe, efficient and economic, is pursued to reduce the emission of flue gases, deforestation, pollution, land degradation and a host of other effects they cause.the study explores the implementation of a solar – wood/coal fired hybrid tobacco curing system as the energy solution for small scale farmers. the coal/wood being made available when solar energy suffer from intermittency of day/night cycles, and reduced irradiation periods during winter, cloudy days, and short transients. 2.background literature a growing number of small scale farmers have moved to tobacco farming. the attractiveness of the crop is depicted by general increase in the price per kilogram on the market in table 1. tobacco is now the mostly grown cash crop as farmers see high prospects of improving their living standards in a depressed economy. these farmers have turned to natural forest as the cheapest source of energy to cure their tobacco leaf. 2784",,"and Recommendations From the study that was done it was recommended that a flat plate air collector of a size 22m2 facing North at a tilt of 22 degrees could be used in conjunction with coal/wood in tobacco barn.The collector will be coupled to a 200W fan or blower which would be powered by a photovoltaic system of solar invertor size of (230V, 480W). The solar inverter would have its own 4m2 solar panel for energy supply. Table 12. Flue gases mass reduction achieved by design The potential use of solar energy to complement the heat energy requirement for small scale farmer tobacco curing in Zimbabwe is feasible and economically viable. According to design if a curing barn is properly insulated, wood energy required is 28MJ/kg instead of the traditional 32,2 MJ/kg to fully cure a kg of leaf tobacco. So by implementing a flat plate air collector of a size 22m2 to an insulated barn will make a contribution of 30.5% of the energy required for tobacco curing.According to this investigationit was shown that solar could be used to produce heat that could be used in the curing barn. Hence this studywas vital in assessment of solar energy potential is reducing emission of greenhouse gases.","ignatio madanhire and takundachiwarange university of zimbabwe, department of mechanical engineering, p.o box mp167, mt pleasant, harare, zimbabwe imadanhire@gmail.com charles mbohwa university of johannesburg, department of quality management and operations management, p. o. box 524, auckland park 2006, south africa. cmbohwa@uj.ac.za",

In light of a legitimate concern for monetary savings, strategies that advance the recuperation of industrial wastes, must be started through instructing people in general and private to energize modern beneficial interaction. More accentuation ought to be on the improvement of components that would all the more adequately urge singular organizations to oversee waste streams successfully while permitting them the essential opportunity to grow new and beneficial utilization for the same. Mindfulness preparing on eco-frameworks is required as a few organizations do not recognize what is required and what they should do. Working through public private partnerships between nearby experts who are involved with waste treatment and landfill locales, ventures that release issue waste to these destinations, waste organizations that have practical experience in waste re- utilize and reusing, and national government that is in charge of authoritative rules ought to set up a platform to lead the EIP improvement activity on existing framework.

404,Simulation Of Patient Flow And Healthcare Resources In A  Hospital,"in this simulation study, we simulate patient arrivals and their flow within a hospital with the objective of improving patient waiting times and effective usage of health care resources such as nurses, physicians and other healthcare personnel. our simulation model includes the following departments of the hospital. registration, triage, emergency department, x-ray, labs, clinics, and the surgery department. we, first collect the arrival data, map out the processes in each department, and collect processing time data for each operation. we also determine the type and number of nurses, physicians, their alternates needed to perform each operation. in our simulation study, we first simulate the current situation in the hospital and establish a baseline for several key performance indicators such as waiting time, number of patients served, nurse and physician utilization. as an improvement attempt, we develop several scenarios which focus on resource sharing among several departments, changing staffing levels of departments during the day based on patient traffic and provide recommendations to the hospital management.","healthcare, simulation",,"afnan hamadah, lina handa, nourhan hasan, samar qutom, yasmeen sheebeeb and ufuk kula industrial engineering department american university of middle east kuwait",
405,Chapter 1: Introduction,"(12 font) crowdsourcing is popular for two reasons. it draws from a global pool of talent and it is where people are acknowledged for the quality of their ideas rather than for their formal academic qualifications. all that matters is the final product, not the backgrounds of those who contributed to it (howe, 2006). however, in order to make the tasks be able to be carried out by the crowds, the tasks should be modularized. in order to to reduce problem- solving inter-dependence among tasks, the tasks themselves need to be specified. the more independent or disconnected a component/task is, the more modular it is.",online business,"4.1. Findings and Implications Crowdsourcing allows the power of the crowd to accomplish tasks that were once the province of just a specialized few. It is conducted by taking the principles which have worked for open source software projects and apply them right across the entire spectrum of the business world (Howe, 2006). 2853","how can large collectives solve problems using the internet?

406,Quality Improvement In Plastic Injection Molding Industry:  Applying Lean Six Sigma To Sme In Kuwait,"in this paper, lean and six sigma were applied to a small and medium-sized enterprise (sme), company xyz for plastic manufacturing in kuwait, to reduce the variation in their injection molding process. variation exists within any process and when this variation goes beyond certain limits, non- conforming parts are produced and the company will face increased percentage of waste, operational cost, and reduced customer’s satisfaction. many of the xyz company plastic fittings were rejected as they were defective or having defects such as internal surface marks, flash, and bubbles. floor traps 6x4x2 fittings accounted for the highest rejection rate in xyz company. six sigma dmaic combined with the 5s were applied to tackle this problem. dmaic is a general engineering design approach that can be applied for many production or service problems that need practical solutions. it is an acronym stands for define, measure, analyze, improve, and control. results show that by implementing six sigma combined with the 5s program, company xyz achieved an improvement in its sigma level and defects rate (dpmo) which lead to significant cost savings and increased its competitiveness.","lean six sigma, dmaic, sme, injection molding, variation","In this project, the concepts of Lean Six Sigma were successfully applied to Company XYZ to improve its injection molding process (Dwivedi, Anas, & Siraj, 2014). DMAIC was used to tackle the problem of the rejecting poor quality products. We found that the consequences of producing poor quality products affected the reputation of the company; money, time and effort are lost when rejected products are scraped, reworked or recycled. We started off by selecting the product with the highest rejection percentage which turned out to be Floor Trap 6x4x2. We then classified the types of defects and defectives produced in this type of product. The current performance of the injection molding process was evaluated in terms of sigma level, and DPMO. This acted as a baseline for our study. In order to find the root causes of the problem, a Fishbone diagram was constructed. Brainstorming sessions were useful in selecting the most appropriate causes that had an influence on the number of defects produced. Following that, DOE was used to find the optimum parameters of the injection speed, injection pressure, and melting temperature that would produce the minimum number of defects. Other causes such as the operator’s behavior, mold surface and so on, were considered in the FMEA. Actions that would reduce the number of defects were implemented, and recommended to Company XYZ. After improving the system, the sigma level increased from 1.4σ to 2.3σ and DPMO decreased from 516,500 to 190,000. This improvement accounts for more than 50% of process improvement. A control chart was used to check for stability of the process, and an Out-of-Control-Action plan was provided to the company for maintaining process improvements. The improvement that we have made will increase profits made by the organization and improve the overall performance of the injection molding process. 2863","alaa alshammari, sahar redha, shahad hussain, tuleen nazzal, zahraa kamal, and walid smew industrial engineering department american university of the middle east (aum) eqaila, kuwait walid.smew@aum.edu.kw","References

Two integer programming models have been proposed having two different objective functions. The first one maximizes the profits of the transportation company defined as the revenue minus the traveling costs. The second attempts to maximize the synergy within the carrier’s network minimizes by minimizing the lanes distances. The paper has shown the scope of the models through an illustrative example but did not include rigorous experimental results that are left for future investigation. Moreover, it would be interesting to integrate such models within a bid generation optimization approach in order to discover how the synergy maximization will affect the procedure of defining the carrier’s bids while participating in a combinatorial auction. dist(e,e’)≤D(e,e’) 2890","chefi triki mechanical and industrial engineering department sultan qaboos university muscat, oman chefi@squ.edu.om","References

410,Procurement Strategy And Supply Risk Analysis Of Coal  By Considering Price Fluctuation And,"under price uncertainty, the decision on how long a supply contract for a certain commodity should be, is an important question a decision maker has to address. the length of supply contract will affect both the financial aspect as well as the risks. this research will discuss about the selection of 3 (three) procurement strategies namely long-term procurement strategy, short-term procurement strategy, and mixed strategy by considering uncertainty factors such as commodity price, supplier delivery time and quality in which the three factors are considered to be uncertain. we compare the benefits, costs and risks associated with each strategy. we use the monte carlo simulation method to represent the level of uncertainty of all variables. cost-benefit analysis is used to calculate the economic aspects while the procurement supply risk analysis is used to determine the risk associated with each strategy. the results show that the mixed strategy of 24- month and 6-month outperformed other strategies.",procurement,"In this paper we evaluate three strategies with respect to procurement contract periods for coal. Evaluation was based on both financial performance and risks. The Monte Carlo simulation was used to obtain the performance of each alternative strategy and the Cost-Benefit analysis was applied to make comparisons. The procurement lead time and the coal quality was taken into account in the model. The results suggest that 12-month contract period provides the lowest in terms of the total costs, but not necessarily the best in terms of the risks. The mixed strategy combining the portion of supply volume with 24-month contract and the rest is covered by a shorter term (6-month contract) is proven the best from risk point of view. This mixed strategy also outperformed both other strategies when we evaluate the alternative strategies based on both financial aspect as well as risks. The results are sensible. As the uncertainty arises in the price of commodities, putting long-term contract could be harmful for both sides. On the other side, too short contract period is costly since the company has to process too many procurement contracts. The exact combination, however, may vary from case to case. A more comprehensive experiments may be needed to obtain a recommended range under wider situations.","supplier delivery time arie bagus wibowo and i nyoman pujawan department of industrial engineering sepuluh nopember institute of technology surabaya, indonesia mrgood1010@gmail.com, pujawan@gmail.com",
411,Reliability Modelling Through Deterioration Prone  Components,"deterioration prone or wear components identification and technical analysis of functional loss characteristics entail a detailed analysis of the failure characteristics of components through the understanding of their failure modes and the technical characteristics of their failure patterns. maintenance actions are then prescribed to prevent functional failures or to proactively repair the components in a bid to prevent failure(s) in the operational field. the determination of ensuing maintenance actions focusses on those actions that are vital to monitor and eradicate unreliable conditions on the components under consideration. deterioration prone machinery components afford maintenance practitioners with the openings to improve physical assets reliability, and this study was embarked on to explore reliability amelioration prospects that are availed through identified components deterioration.","deterioration, wear-components, functional-loss","The key to improving physical assets reliability in any industrial set up is firstly, undertaking an analysis of the key drivers of equipment unreliability. The dominant failure modes need to be unveiled and further stratified in order to reveal the underlying causes of functional failures of the physical assets. The case study that was undertaken illustrated that without accurate data analysis, it is highly possible for a business to focus its resources on nonexistent or insignificant issues that do not address the inherent reliability issues that are relevant during that time. The data analysis showed that components deterioration was the major contributor to equipment failures within the processing plant, and it was prudent to develop reliability improvement strategic models that aimed at eradicating or diminishing the impact of deterioration on the components of physical assets. Deterioration is inevitable in physical assets components, whether they rotate, slide or are stationary during their operational status, because one way or another, the agents that cause deterioration will attack them. Unless the physical assets operate in a vacuum, that is the only scenario that maybe have them spared from deterioration. Different types of deterioration were examined during this research, and prominently corrosion and erosion types of deterioration were reviewed, with techniques of counteracting their progression discussed as well. More research need to be undertaken in developing scientific models to counteract deterioration in the industrial setup.","peter muganyi department of engineering management university of johannesburg johannesburg, south africa peter777.muganyi@gmail.com charles mbohwa faculty of engineering and the built environment university of johannesburg johannesburg, south africa cmbohwa@uj.ac.za ignatio madanhire department of mechanical engineering university of zimbabwe, p.o box mp167 harare, zimbabwe imadanhire@eng.uz.ac.zw",
412,Warranting Physical Assets Reliability Through Criticality  Optimization,"criticality optimization for physical assets maintenance is meant to warrant high plant reliability for the processing plant. this is a vivacious trait that a bulk of industrial establishments discount and calamitous effects are typically encountered such as lessened reliability of installed equipment owing to wrong maintenance priorities. equipment criticality ranking constructed on diverse impacts of equipment failure(s) on the businesses need to be carried out so that the businesses do not take a blanket approach to applying the same maintenance strategies and allocating resources unrestrained on all processing physical assets. maintenance resources allocations need to be apportioned and prioritized as per equipment criticality ranking, and the various facets to consider encompass safety, environment, operations, financial, customer service and quality focused elements, and this is vital for securing cost-effectiveness in maintenance and high reliability in physical assets. derivation of the processing plant’s physical assets spares is consequential to assets criticality analysis and the related parts are managed according to their impacts on the businesses according to the laid-down criteria. this research was carried out to establish the priorities that businesses take at physical asset maintenance level to warrant equipment reliability.","criticality, ranking, optimization","The results of the case study shows that though there are variants of physical assets criticality optimization models that various businesses can apply, it is feasible to apply a specific model that can give consistent results when a systematic approach has been undertaken. Even though the use of the numerical decision-making techniques had some limitations in the absence of the likes of fuzzy based AHP decision making systems, it was shown that the key aim of every asset criticality optimization model is to cost-effectively maintain physical assets to upsurge their reliability in an economically optimum manner. The criticality optimization model, whichever is selected, for instance, TAHPP, should ultimately create a priority hierarchy of assets constructed on specific applicable criteria. The quality of input data is crucial to prevent ambiguity of the decision process, and this is key to the ensuing processes as maintenance resources can be eventually wasted on non-critical assets as a result. The consequence or impact of equipment failures is a critical aspect that always needs to be considered during the criticality optimization process, and aspects such as impact on maintenance and operational costs, impact on health, safety and environment are paramount. At the end of the day, the criticality optimization model computes the significance of physical assets according to assigned criteria weights, and the resultant priority rankings are utilized to formulate asset care strategies for physical assets to mitigate the overall impact on the business as a whole. The overall business impact or performance is ameliorated when the physical assets attain high reliability in the operational environment, thus heightening assets availability for operational viability.","peter muganyi department of engineering management university of johannesburg johannesburg, south africa peter777.muganyi@gmail.com charles mbohwa faculty of engineering and the built environment university of johannesburg johannesburg, south africa cmbohwa@uj.ac.za ignatio madanhire department of mechanical engineering university of zimbabwe, p.o box mp167 harare, zimbabwe imadanhire@eng.uz.ac.zw",
413,Operational Environment Considerations For Reliability  Peter Muganyi,"the environments in which the various industrial equipment operate in mostly limit the operational life of the equipment. the operational environment ranges from hot, cold, corrosive, non-corrosive, strong forces, etc. and no universal material selection is ideal for all operating conditions. a lot of effort needs to be put into the material selections and designs of industrial equipment in order to withstand the relevant operating environment. physical assets reliability is highly affected by the operating conditions and the applicable maintenance actions need to be deployed to prevent catastrophic equipment failures. the magnitude of failures is also sometimes heavily determined by the operational conditions and the maintenance actions that are taken to counteract the impact of failures are vital considerations for the physical assets reliability. the study is an exploration of reliability aspects pertaining to physical assets in the various operating environments.",environment,"All physical assets ought to match their intended purpose and application parameters, including several diverse performance, environmental, application and service factors. All must be met for the physical asset to operate reliably and properly. When selected with these design parameters in consideration , and when installed and operated correctly, a physical asset should have no reliability issues over its lifetime, but when one of the factors like environmental factors are not met, then the asset can prematurely fail, resulting in reduced asset reliability and high maintenance /operational costs incurred by the firm. The two primary environmental issues that cause physical assets failures are temperature-related (above or below the rated temperature of the asset), or chemical-related (where the asset is not compatible with a chemical present within or around it). Over temperature conditions can manifest as heat stress cracks on the material, whilst chemical attacks generally make the asset swiftly deteriorate and fail, sometimes breaking-off in pieces. Therefore compatibility of assets with environmental factors is a crucial aspect when it comes to ensuring reliability.","department of engineering management university of johannesburg johannesburg, south africa peter777.muganyi@gmail.com charles mbohwa faculty of engineering and the built environment university of johannesburg johannesburg, south africa cmbohwa@uj.ac.za ignatio madanhire department of mechanical engineering, university of zimbabwe, p.o box mp167, mt pleasant, harare, zimbabwe imadanhire@eng.uz.ac.zw",
414,Design-Out Maintenance As A Crucial Maintenance Facet  Peter Muganyi,"in many instances, maintenance engineers arrive at a point where the maintenance decision calls for the redesign of the physical asset in order to address the reliability issues encountered during the course of operating and maintaining the asset. one of the most effective and broadly applied techniques is design- out maintenance (dom) and many researchers in maintenance management have alluded to this technique as highly effective and widely applied in the field of asset maintenance. the drivers for physical assets modifications are diverse and situational as various factors are considered when it comes to such endeavour, and the cost of the modification or re-design being one of them. a systematic approach to this engineering phenomenon is imperative to give guidance and credence to this noble approach, followed by evaluation techniques for the effectiveness of the exercise. this study pursued an industrial set-up analysis to examine the pros and cons of the dom technique.","design-out, systematic, modification","Design-out maintenance strategy is still being applied by many industrial establishments and it is effective in improving equipment reliability when it is applied correctly.

416,Supplier Selection Framework For Dairy Industry In  Indonesia,"dairy market in indonesia has good demand trends. however, the domestic supply is still below the consumption level. thus, this country used to import dairy product rather than use the domestic one. on the other hand, dairy supply chain has its own uncertainty both in upstream and downstream process due to the durability of raw materials, such as tropical climate, unpredictable seasons, and lack of cold storage. it raises challenges for overland transportation. selecting right supplier is one of the upstream area which affected the quality of dairy product and mitigate the supply chain risks. this study aims to develop a framework for supplier selection process. it determined main criteria through interview, pair wise comparison using ahp method, then deployed into some sub-criterias based, then been ranked. the result is a supplier selection assessment based on local company requirements. it can be concluded that the main criteria for supplier selection are quality, quantity, delivery, warranty, and pricing with sub main criteria which already deployed. the output could help most of the indonesia dairy industries, which mostly small to medium scale, to achieve competitive advantages by solving one of the critical stages.","dairy, framework, supplier selection, supply chain","Regarding to the result of this study, it can be concluded : 1. Selecting the right supplier is a critical role in the beginning process of supply chain management. 2. The main criterias for supplier selection are quality, delivery, quantity, pricing, and warranty. In addition, the sub criterias are deployed from main criterias based on company requirement. 3. Warranty criteria only used in some conditional situation due to company terms and policies. 4. The sensitivity analysis is performed to describe the effect of changing weights in main criteria.

417,Methods To Mitigate Supply Chain Risks Related To Freezedried Fruit Importation To South Africa,"(12 font) supply chains, especially global supply chains, can be complex and include multiple partners. owing to the diversity between supply chains, the risks applicable to each may differ. not enough research has been conducted on businesses using an inter-disciplinary approach when attempting risk management. therefore, the purpose of this investigation was to explore how the combination of financial and operational risk management methods can be used to assist carbocraft in mitigating the risks identified and associated with the import of freeze-dried fruit from germany to their customers in durban, cape town and johannesburg. risks were listed and discussed whilst mitigation strategies were suggested. risk supply chain mitigations, freeze dried fruit, carbocraft, mitigation strategies introduction carbocraft is an importer of raw food ingredients, based in johannesburg, south africa. the company was founded in 2010 and has since grown to 11 employees. the study was conducted at carbocraft, primarily focusing on the supply chain risks related to importation of freeze-dried fruits into south africa. the freeze- dried (fd) fruit is sourced by carbocraft from paradise fruit, a company based in germany. paradise fruit is a company that has emerged as an industry leader in the field of freeze-drying (paradise fruits, 2014). paradise fruits define their freeze-drying process as: freeze-drying is a process where frozen raw materials are placed in a refrigerated vacuum and ice crystals in the product are sublimated into water vapour, while the cell structure of the original product remains. carbocraft places purchase orders with paradise fruit, for shipping in a food-grade container, from germany to south africa. the freeze-dried fruit is non-perishable, sealed in thick plastic bags that are packed in cartons, then palletized. this product can have a production lead-time of 1-3 weeks, as the products are produced according to orders received. freeze-dried fruit generally has a shelf-life of a year, sometimes a year and a half, thus limiting the inventory the supplier is able to keep available. shipping from germany to south africa takes approximately four weeks. following which the total lead-time for this product is 4-6 weeks. the shipment is then cleared through customs and delivered to carbocraft’s outsourced warehouses. all shipments from paradise fruit are handled ex- works by outsourced freight forwarders. however, the process is not without risks. the ultimate purpose of risk identification and analysis is to prepare for risk mitigation. this study will review the supply chain, identify and define risks within it and then explore the different methods available for avoiding and possibly counter-acting these risks. in order to identify risks, a definition for ‘risk’ must be established. cause and effect over time allows risk to be defined as “the probability of occurrence of disruptive events” heckmann, et al. (2015). the definition of risk has endured many modifications and as such the expansion of risk management and development of continuous improvement strategies remains necessary (gilaninia, et al., 2013). risk is the effect of uncertainty on objectives, whether positive or negative (iso guide 73, 2009). as imports and exports increase throughout the globe, supply chains are growing more complex and involve more agents, multiple materials-handling points, multiple money movements and information movements throughout the process. owing to the increase in complexity, supply chains have become more volatile as they are exposed to more 2927",,,"kyra styles, joanne keyser, ashleigh bosman and sebonkile thaba department of transport and supply chain management university of johannesburg johannesburg, south africa scthaba@uj.ac.za","References

The paper touches the drought impact from humanitarian view, and the recommendations that SADC region can use for the future when dealing with such events. We also address the water crisis in South Africa, and WASH organization (Water, Sanitation and hygiene). SADC leaders implemented new interventions. The papers found Gaps in the solutions of emergency relief phases, preparedness, response and recovery. With our efforts we came up with proposed solutions that can work for South Africa.

421,Relationship Between Safety Climate Factors And Safety  Performance In Chemical Industries,"safety is an important issue in the rapid industrialization especially in chemical industries. the objective of this study is to investigate relationship between safety climate factors and safety performance in chemical industries and proposes a new framework. this study uses safety management, work pressure, safety competence, safety procedures, safety communication and safety supervision as independent variables that explain the relationship towards safety performance in chemical industry at pasir gudang, johor. a survey instrument was developed, and 220 responses were collected. factor analysis and multiple linear regression was used to analyze the data collected using spss software. as a result, safety climate factors (safety management and work pressure, safety competence, safety communication and safety procedures) were able to explain 47.2% of variation safety performance. nonetheless, it was found that reflections of safety climate factors on safety performance could not be similar with each industry, since findings would fluctuate due to geographical context and individual context. despite the limitations, this study contributes to the literature by revealing table factor structures, where appropriate level of reliability and validity measures of safety climate factors and safety performance scales were developed.","safety performance, factor analysis, smartpls","and Future Work 4.1 Conclusion The main purpose of this study was to identify safety climate factors and safety performance in chemical industries in Johor and has been established. The finding of this study which derived the safety climate factors of safety communication, safety procedures, safety competence, safety management and work pressure are found to be similar to previous studies in various industries. Safety management was renamed to explain the safety commitment and safety supervision factors. A newly reliable developed relationship was able to explain 47.2% of relationship between safety climate factors and safety performance which full fill the second objective of this study. Although, only 47.2% of safety climate factors were found to impact safety performance of chemical industries in Johor, which common findings in a social investigation, then reflections of safety climate factors on safety performance could not be similar with each industry as compared with other researchers finding. In addition, the findings would fluctuate due to geographical context and individual context. Furthermore, even though the only 47.2 % of derived safety climate factors explain the relationship with safety performance, it is found that all 26 individual constructs are found to be valid and consistent thorough model evaluation. Although, the findings of the study were able to achieve the objectives, there are plenty of gaps and limitations which need be considered for future work. 4.2 Study Limitations The findings of this study must be interpreted based on the following limitations. The results of this study were dependent upon sincere and honest responses from participants and there are no complimentary actions. Moreover, demographic factors also play an important role in manipulating the relationship between safety climate factors and safety performance (Vinodkumar & Bhasi, 2009). Thus, in future, effects of demographic factors on safety performance also should analyse co-currently, and the respondent’s perceptions shall be analysed by demographic factors such as age, working experience, education and position in the particular firm. Despite these limitations, this study actually contributes to the literature revealing factor structures of safety climate, where appropriate level of reliability and validity measures of safety climate scale was developed. However, it is strongly recommended to do more exploration on the safety climate factors by increasing the number of independent variables and number of samples and also compare the findings with previous studies by revalidating the previous established safety survey instrument. 4.3 Future Work There are few items and issues to be considered in order to improve and increase the final results. Since in this study, the area of study was just focused on chemical industries in Pasir Gudang. In future, it should be expanded to more chemical industries around Johor and also around Malaysia. Furthermore, a longitudinal study should be carried out for the collected survey data since in this study was only in cross sectional. Furthermore, safety performance based on the perceptions will need to be supported by collecting more objectives and quantitative data measuring actual safety performance such as accident rates, injury cases, fatal cases and near missed cases.

422,Effects Of Inlet Flow Rate And Penstock’S Geometry On The  Performance Of Gravitational Water Vortex Power Plant,"gravitational water vortex power plant (gwvpp) is one of the green technology that utilizes hydropower at low hydraulic head. different from large-scale hydropower, gwvpp is a micro hydropower plant that harvest energy from water vortex formed in a cylindrical basin. it is advantageous due to its low hydraulic head requirement as well as positive impacts on both environments and social. experimental approach was taken in this paper to study the effects of inlet flow rate and penstock’s geometry of gwvpp on performance of gwvpp. the outlet and basin diameter were fixed at 72mm and 400mm respectively. inlet flow rates were varied from 5.6m3/h to 8.8m3/h while three penstock model a to c have increasing feeding width but same model length while penstock d to f have same feeding width as penstock a but reducing model length. it was discovered that penstock b and c reduced the overall performance of gwvpp while the rest of the penstock have insignificant effects on gwvpp’s efficiency. also, higher inlet flow rate was also discovered to generally increase the efficiency of gwvpp. future works will involve changing the outlet’s diameter as well as elevating the penstock to study its effect on gwvpp’s performance.","gwvpp, hydropower","In a nutshell, the maximum achievable efficiency was found to be 28.29% when Penstock E was installed along with inlet flow rate of 8.8m3/h. The power output of the configuration was also highest compared to other configurations. Also, it was found that peak performance of the prototype is between 8.0m3/h to 9.6m3/h. However, such finding requires validation because the experiments carried out did not include inlet flow rate of 9.6m3/h. Other than that, it was also determined that the smaller the penstock’s feeding width, the higher the efficiency of GWVPP.

423,A Comparative Study Of Physical And  Mechanical Properties Of Wood Plastic,"in recent years, concerns about environmental preservation have fostered research on alternative natural materials, motivated industries to employ more environmentally friendly materials and encouraged the implementation of recycling activities. a comparative study was conducted to investigate the physical and mechanical properties of wood plastic composites (wpc) produced from polypropylene (pp) and recycled polyethylene terephthalate (pet) with different types of fibres (coconut coir, bagasse, and pineapple leaves). the natural fibres were chemically treated then mixed with the pp and pet using a brabender mixer at the temperature of 200 °c. the wpcs were produced using hot pressing at the temperature of 180 °c with pressure of 0.098 mpa for 15 minutes. then, the colour, density, water absorption capacity, modulus of rupture, and modulus of elasticity were examined. the results showed that physical and mechanical properties of wpc were strongly dependent on the types and amount of fibres. moreover, this study also revealed that wpc produced with pineapple leaves fibre possessed excellent physical properties and mechanical properties compared to coconut coir and bagasse fibre. the results of the study indicated that wpc produced from a mixture of pp, recycled pet and pineapple leaves fibre is a viable alternative material to natural wood for wood-based industries.","bagasse, coconut coir, pineapple leaves","In conclusion, the mixture of polypropylene, recycled PET and natural fibres makes possible the manufacture of environmentally friendly WPCs. The colour, density, water absorption, MOR, and MOE are strongly dependent on the types and amount of fibres. The density, MOR and MOE decreased with increase in amount of fibre due to fibre agglomeration inside the composite which lead to the formation of voids and eventually affected the physical and mechanical properties of WPCs. On the contrary, water absorption increased with the increase in the amount of fibre. This is mainly attributed to the hygroscopic property of natural fibre. In term of physical properties, WPCs produced with coconut coir, bagasse and pineapple leaves exhibited light brown and dark brown colours which are similar to the natural colour of wood. Additionally, it appears that WPCs produced with pineapple leaves exhibited excellent mechanical properties (MOE = 8.3 MPa and MOR 1353 MPa) compared to coconut coir (MOE = 8.13 MPa and MOR 353 MPa) and bagasse (MOE = 11.02 MPa and MOR 423 MPa). Further research is needed to optimise the processing parameters for improving the physical and mechanical properties of WPC produced with the mixture of polypropylene, recycled PET, and natural fibres.","composite produced from different agriculture residues noor afifah ariffin, nurain nabila haslizam, saidatul asyilah samsurrijal, mohamad ali selimin, norpadzlihatun manap, and lee te chuan* faculty of technology management and business, universiti tun hussein onn malaysia (uthm), parit raja 86400, batu pahat, johor, malaysia ap140265@siswa.uthm.edu.my, ap140122@siswa.uthm.edu.my, ap140142@siswa.uthm.edu.my , aliselimin@uthm.edu.my, tclee@uthm.edu.my* hasan zuhudi abdullah, maizlinda izwana idris faculty of mechanical and manufacturing engineering, universiti tun hussein onn malaysia (uthm), parit raja 86400, batu pahat, johor, malaysia hasan@uthm.edu.my, izwana@uthm.edu.my",

The main objective of this study is to determine waiting time of patient’s flow which can be used to improve the operating performance and also improving the quality of the services provided to the patients. The first objective to this study to determine the waiting arrival time and service time of patients at outpatient department. This results is shown at the Table 2, 3 and 4. The result stated that the average waiting time of patients in queue is 54.295 minutes with the average total exit patient is 327 patients. Thus, the average service time is 13.481 minutes. In comparison, a study in Malaysia found that the average service time in outpatients was 15 minutes (Ba et al., 2017). There is no specific guideline on the best service length but studies found that patients prefer to have more time with the doctor. Meanwhile the second objective is proved that this study using the simulation technique for model queuing system. Based on the results of multiple server channel patient flow simulation model developed, it is proved that there is waiting time achieved with Ministry of Health patient charter. In this patient charter stated that patients should achieved the target of waiting to see the doctor within or less than 60 minutes. Simulation model result shows that longest waiting time exist at pre-consultation room about 28 minutes and the lowest utilization of server is at registration counter about 59%. Therefore, suggested improvement need to make to this stations with a view to reduce the waiting time and increase the utilization of server. This is to ensure the high quality of services is delivered. The outcome of this study is the better understanding of queuing theory and management service. In addition, the health care providers can make decision that increase the satisfaction of all relevant group besides optimizing the resources. This study further established that queuing theory and modelling is an effective tool that can be used to make decisions on staffing needs for optimal performance with regards to queuing challenges in clinics. This study therefore be replicated in other clinics or other countries in order to inform clinic administrators more on the usefulness of the application of queuing theory and modelling as a tool for improved decision making. 5.2 Limitation of the study Researcher fined it is difficult to use the ARENA software in student vision.

429,Material Procurement Model Considering Life Time And  Minimum Order Quantity,"this paper presents the results of developing models to determine the size of material ordering by considering life time and minimum order quantity (moq). this topic was inspired by real problem at an aerospace company located in bandung. the faced real problem is how to minimize waste in material procurement due to short of material life time and minimum order quantity from suppliers. the waste is caused by a lot of unused material (eventualy expired and causing high expired cost), added with high of ordering costs, storage costs and stockout costs. until now the authors have not found the appropriate model. on the basis the authors developed or modified a new model. the developed model is deterministic category by assumption of material demand, lead time and costs involved are considered fixed or unchanged. the developed model are combination between optimal and heuristic approach. the developed model will get optimal solution when the normal situation faced, but for the specific situation the best solution will be found by heuristical approach. authors believe this research will be very useful for companies, as well as for scientific development related to optimization in the field of inventory control and material management.","life time, expired cost","The developed model resulted optimal formulation for the T order interval, followed by an advanced calculation or algorithm to meet eligibility requirements. The developed algorithm starts from finding the optimal value by considering life time and minimum order quantity by considering purchase cost, order cost, storage cost, and expired cost. From the developed model above, the optimum T by considering life time and minimum order quantity can be achieved maximally (100%) when the life time of material is relatively long and MOQ is relatively small. If the condition is not obtained then the optimal value will change following the eligibility requirements in accordance to algorithm developed.

431,Building A Safety Culture In The Construction Sector: A  Model To Assess The Safety Maturity Of A Company,"high numbers of work accidents prove that work safety can no longer be denied. there must be a system to manage safety, especially in the construction sector, which has the highest contribution of work accidents in indonesia. the system to manage safety is usually called safety, health, and environment system (she system). however, the success of she systems is affected by the safety maturity level of the company. in fact, the number of work accidents is still increasing even though she systems have been applied in those companies. this research was conducted to develop a safety maturity model in order to improve safety and project performances. this research will draw a portrait of the existing safety maturity level of indonesian construction companies. after knowing the existing level and the indicators that have not been fulfilled, a model for improving the existing safety maturity level was developed. the variables of the research are: safety policy, safety institution, safety cultures, safety maturity level, safety performance and project performance. this research was conducted through delphi and questionnaire survey methods. the results of this research are the improvement of a safety maturity model and the suggestion of improvement actions to increase safety maturity level.","work accidents, she","In conclusion, every construction enterprise is at its own safety maturity level. The sequences of the level start from basic, reactive, compliant, proactive, until resilient level. The survey has shown to us the three indicators for each level that can be improve so they can level up the enterprises safety maturity level. The suggestion methods are given above to improve from the existing level to the higher level. By improving enterprises safety maturity level, it will create better safety cultures. When great safety cultures are settled, it will give a great safety performance. A great safety performance will eliminate work accidents, work illnesses and will save a lot of project time and project cost. By eliminating those risks is also ensuring the quality of the result. Last but not least, a good safety performance will affect the project performance. So in simple words, by improving safety maturity level will deliver a good project performance.","johan santoso, yusuf latief and rossy armyn machfudiyanto department of civil engineering universitas indonesia depok, west java, indonesia, 16424 jsjohansantoso@gmail.com, latief73@eng.ui.ac.id, rossyarmyn@gmail.com",

438,Assessment Project Management (Pm) Roles Responsible  For Abandonment Of Construction Projects,"the influence of project management on construction projects anywhere in the world cannot be underestimated as poor project management has grave effects on the stakeholders (clients, consultants, contractors and users) and the projects at large. the aim of this study is to investigate the level of awareness of project managers of their roles on construction projects and determine the deficient project management roles that lead to abandonment of construction projects. the study is survey in nature and uses both questionnaire and interview (confirmatory) to elicit necessary information for the study. the population of the study consists of abandoned building projects in lagos, nigeria. sixty-six 66 questionnaires out of the 80 that were administered on project managers of abandoned building projects were returned and used for the study. thus, the project managers of public and private abandoned projects were used for the study and the results of the study were analyzed with frequencies, percentages and mean item scores. the results of the study indicate that out of the 16 project management roles identified, project managers are very aware of two and aware of the remaining 14. also, the study found that deficiency in 13 of the roles had high degrees of leading to project abandonment. the conclusion of the study is that project managers are aware of their roles on construction projects but the roles were not performed on those projects, thus leading to project abandonment. in view of this, the study further concludes that there would be some uninvestigated exogenous factors that are responsible for the non-performance of pm roles on those projects. hence, the study recommends that further studies into why project managers fail to perform their roles on construction projects should be conducted. the study also recommends that project managers must engage in adequate planning, cost control and resource management to prevent project abandonment","project abandonment, building projects, project manager","The study investigates the level of awareness of project managers of their roles on construction projects. The study also investigates the project management roles that could lead to project failure on construction projects if they are not performed. The findings of the study indicate that the respondents are aware of all of the roles of project managers on construction projects. This result is not expected because most of the professionals in the built environment that practice project management were admitted for postgraduate or professional studies. The respondents are very aware that as construction project managers, they need to plan work execution and manage client issues. Moreover, they claim that non-management of client issues, management of construction process, resource allocation and utilization, developing budget schedule and monitoring them, planning of work execution, management of risks, delivering project within cost and time constraint, management of project finance, definition of work requirements, management of design process, progress monitoring and plan adjustment, management of approval processes and management of claims would to a high degree lead to construction project failure if not carried out or properly carried out. However, to an average degree, management of safety, management of project environment and ensuring final deliverable meeting are the project management roles that could lead to project management in the Nigerian construction industry. Therefore, the conclusion of the study is that, professionals in the built environment are aware of the roles of project managers on construction projects. Further to this, the study concluded that, construction professionals agree to a high 3078","oluwaseun s. dosumu sustainable human settlement and construction research centre faculty of engineering and the built environment, university of johannesburg, south africa oluwaseundosumu97@gmail.com clinton, aigbavboa sustainable human settlement and construction research centre faculty of engineering and the built environment, university of johannesburg, south africa calgbavboa@uj.ac.za2","References

444,The Relationship Between The ‘Big Five’ Personality And  Career Success,"the aim of this descriptive and correlational research is to explore the relationship between employee’s personality and career achievement. this study involved 126 respondents ranging from grades 1 to 54 in the land and mines office, nusajaya, johor. the respondents were selected using stratified random sampling method. the big five inventory (bfi) questionnaire was designed to evaluate the respondents’ personality, while the minnesota satisfaction questionnaire (msq) was developed to measure their career success. then, the collected data was analyzed using the statistical package for social sciences (spss) version 20.0. the results indicated that the ‘openness to experience’ personality trait was found high in the majority of respondents as compared to the other four personality dimensions. in addition, the respondents scored higher in intrinsic career success as compared to extrinsic career success. furthermore, the pearson correlation test revealed that the dimensions of agreeableness, extraversion, openness to experience, and conscientiousness are associated to the intrinsic career success. however, the findings related to extrinsic career success showed a positive relationship with the conscientiousness dimension, and a negative relationship with the neuroticism dimension. finally, the findings from this study will make a significant contribution to the field of personality and career success.","career success, personality traits","This study gives better understanding and holistic view for the organization regarding the factors that affect the career success of the employees. Even the results of this research study shows the relationship between Big Five Personality and Career Success among the employees at Department of Registration, Land and Mines Office (PTG) in Nusajaya, Johor are not enough strong correlation that is because majority of the employees in the government sector at this country which is Malaysia still assume the uses of big five personality is still not important to their lives. One of the reason why this situation happened is they are not exposed to the interest or importance of the big five personality quality in enhancing their career success and life. However, it is also a good platform for the organization to have a more comprehensive view in developing a long-term strategic action plan. Other than that, it encourages the implementation of detailed personality tests which are practical or useful to the employees.

445,Shopping Centre Classification Scheme: A Comparison Of  International Case Studies,": shopping centre are retail properties with special qualities compared to other property investments. shopping centre are the most glorious places these days with their attractive shops and a wide variety people where people spend their weekends to relax and shop. the base for the payoff of all commercial real estate investments is its tenants and thus the purchasing power these are able to attract. the retail tenants might differ in size, management, sales, their exposure to consumer trends and in their positions on their market and positions towards their competitors. however, it appears the forces driving retail expansion all over the world have deviated from actual consumer demand. with the changing tastes and preferences of customers, shopping centre extend a global impact across metros, cities and towns. the scope of the retail business in malaysia is broad and includes hypermarkets, shopping malls, specialty stores, and direct sales. there are numerous shopping malls of different size, categories and concept located in klang valley and the number of shopping centre is still increasing. now, with the emergence of more shopping malls, undoubtedly the competitions between malls have become stiffer. shopping malls that are unable to stand the test of time will not survive. this is because newer malls have been built with creative designs, styles, ideas and concepts to attract customers. other great challenges faced by shopping malls are that they have to find and retain their tenants. customers would expect certain criteria to be met for optimal satisfaction. therefore, this paper is to explores the literature review made to be applied in classification of shopping centre in malaysian dimensions in order to determine and develop the classification framework. in addition, this paper seeks the adoption concept of shopping centres in malaysia. the criteria of classification of shopping centre gained through literature reviews can be set as reference as a rating tool for a grading of shopping centre for developer, tenant and customer to make decision and investment purpose in the future.","shopping centre, classification, rating tool, grading, criteria 3131","Finally, based on result from critical literature review analysis, it can be concluded that the result shows there are ten (10) suitable categories of shopping centre can be adapted in local context to develop the classification model shopping centre in Malaysia. Each categories has criteria and sub criteria. There are fourteen (14) criteria for each categories of shopping centre. The purpose to grading of shopping centre to help the owners rank portfolio holdings and shed low-scoring properties. Lenders use it in a similar manner. Retailers often use grading to help them evaluate the setting for which their stores exists. (ICSC, 2009). Gregory Kerfoot (2009) suggested mall-grading criteria using an A-B-C-D grading matrix that captured population in the trade area, the number of anchors, small- tenant occupancy and competition. PriceWaterhouseCoopers (PWC) used expert opinion from retail real-estate- industry professionals to create a grading system for regional malls. Although its survey-based system has been recast in mid-2009, PWC’s regional-mall classification remains based on sales-per-sq-ft evaluations, which is its shorthand for easy classification of a host of factors that would impact the sales performance. From the preliminary study, the important citeria including location, size, Catchment area and anchor tenant. Tanan (1998) was stated five important factors as attraction power of shopping center that is location, business concept, design, tenant mix, and management. This shopping centre classification model can be betterment benchmarking for Malaysian property industry in general. 3141","ihfasuziella ibrahim, abdul talib bon, abdul hadi nawawi and edie ezwan mohd safian faculty of architecture, planning and surveying, uitm, 40450 shah alam, malaysia faculty of technology management & business, uthm, 86400 johor, malaysia ihfasuziella.ibrahim@yahoo.com, talib@uthm.edu.my, , abdul274@salam.uitm.edu.my,edie@uthm.edu.my ihfasuziella ibrahim architecture, planning and surveying department uitm, shah alam, malaysia ihfasuziella.ibrahim@yahoo.com","References

447,Implementation Of Production Planning Tools In  Sugar Industry,"the aim of this paper is to improve the condition of sugar industry by identifying and eliminating the waste by applying the production planning tools and lean principles. production lead time reduction is an important means to improve productivity in manufacturing industries. the forecasting of sugarcane supply is carried out using simple moving average, the forecasting of sugar production capacity of industry and sugar market demand is studied and analyzed to see whether the company can satisfy the demand in future. the mrp is also carried out for the chemicals like limestone, phosphate which are bought from outside. the paper also focuses on reducing the break downs in an industry and reduce the waiting time of the sugarcane delivery. the implementation procedure is discussed. the feasibility and the significance of lean production are discussed and the results are also shown. 1. introduction this research paper addresses the application of production planning and control concepts to sugar industry which is continuous processing industry. continuous production is a flow production method used to manufacture, produce, or process materials without interruption. continuous production is called a continuous process or a continuous flow process because the materials, either dry bulk or fluids that are being processed are continuously in motion, undergoing chemical reactions or subject to mechanical or heat treatment. shri prabhulingeshwar sugars & chemicals ltd., founded by mr. jagadeesh s gudagunti is an integrated company primarily engaged in the manufacture of sugar and allied products. the company was founded in 1999 in siddapur village, jamakhandi taluka, bagalkot district. 1.1 problem statement production planning and control have been widely used in discreet industry application but the application of production planning and control to the continuous process industry have been fewer. this is because such industries are inherently more efficient and present relatively less need for such improvement activities. the sugar should be produced continuously to meet the daily production target. the company is failing to meet the customer demand due to lack of sugar cane availability, break downs, non-value-added activities. 1.2 objective the objective of the study is to improve the production of sugar by reducing the time taken for non-value-added activities such as setup, movement of material by using lean tools. the objective is also to improve operator safety and reduce fatigue and reduce the break downs. 1.3 literature review forecasting by moving average method: if a time series is generated by a constant process subject to random error, then mean is a useful statistic and can be used as a forecast for the next period. averaging methods are suitable for stationary time series data where the series is in equilibrium around a constant value (the underlying mean) with a constant variance over time. 3539",,"From this research, I could forecast the supply of sugarcane in year 2017. The production capacity and demand of sugar bags was also forecasted for year 2017 which will help the company to know the status and work on it to meet the future demand. The research also predicts the demand of sugar for next 6 years, it was found that the company would not satisfy the demand, so it is recommended to increase the capacity from 8500 tons of crushing per day to 12000 tons of crushing per day. The amount associated in instalment of extra resource is 2.35 million dollars and the payback period is 6 years from the money made by the result of extra resource allocation. Therefore, it is feasible to invest to increase the crushing capacity. 6.","santosh gudagunti master of science in industrial engineering lawrence technological university southfield, mi 48075, usa sgudagunt@ltu.edu dr. ahad ali a. leon linton department of mechanical engineering lawrence technological university southfield, mi 48075, usa aali@ltu.edu",
448,Budget Airline Operations Optimization Using Linear  Programming,"linear programming (lp) technique is a vital technique in the optimization of resource allocation and achieving efficiency in planning particularly in achieving profit for the budget airline by flying more often to more profitable route among the top 5 airports in the united states of america. in this paper, a linear programming technique is applied to determine the optimum no of time a budget airline need to fly between 2 cities to make maximum profit with respect to various factors such as fuel price and staff salary for the year 2017. the proposed lp model is solved by standard simplex algorithm and solver. it is observed that the proposed lp model is appropriate for finding the optimal no of times budget airlines need to fly between cities and making maximum profit.","simplex algorithm, decision",". By using Lingo programming and Solver for Integer programming we can identify the number of flight required between two cities to maintain the connectivity and get maximum profit for a budget airline. This helps the budget airline to be a game changer in the airline industry. By taking such steps airlines can operate efficiently and avoid wastage of resources. The same kind of Technique can be used to optimize the Bus service in a city by the changing the frequency of the bus across the city. It can also be used to optimize Train Service across the vast country. In this case, no of trains or no of couches in a train can be changed to get an optimized result in operation.","pankil patel and dr. ahad ali a. leon linton department of mechanical engineering lawrence technological university southfield, mi 48075, usa ppatel3@ltu.edu aali@ltu.edu",
449,Optimization Of Distribution Channel   Vehicle Routing Problem With Time Windows,"the newspaper industry has some distinctive qualification which makes it stands out from other industries especially in the distribution process. the strict is a short delivery deadline that will affect the product price. because of the demand is defined, with some agencies spread on an area so the problem in the newspaper industry will be the vehicle routing problem with time window (vrptw). optimal route can be determined using differential evolution algorithm to calculate the shortest route for every agency and maximized the usage of the vehicle using coordinates and demands of the agencies. the result shows that there is an optimal route which have shorter route and shorter travel time than the existing route in the distribution process.","distribution, vrptw","From result of data processing that have been done can be concluded that result of determination of VRPTW model by using Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm get optimal proposed route with total distance of 32.6 km with estimated time of 1 hour 28 minutes compared to existing route with 38 km distance and estimated time of 1 hour 44 minutes. So the new route produced is better because it has a shorter time and a shorter distance that can result in savings of IDR 41,958,000.00 with no investment is made. Further research can be conducted by combining using qualitative methods that will enrich the model and can reflect the real condition more closely.","using differential evolution algorithm: a case study in newspaper industry iqbal wahyu saputra, muhammad hisjam, wahyudi sutopo department of industrial engineering, faculty of engineering, universitas sebelas maret surakarta 57126, indonesia iqbalwahyusaputra@gmail.com, hisjam@gmail.com, wahyudisutopo@gmail.com",
