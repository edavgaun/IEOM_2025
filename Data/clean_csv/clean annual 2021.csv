0,Development Of Solution Methodologies For Online Order  Fulfillment In Omnichannel Retailing,"over the last few decades, retailing has gone through paramount of transformations and is moving towards omnichannel retailing for integrating store-based and online retailing. however, store-based retailers have apprehensions about omnichannel retailing because of high fulfillment cost and low profitability for online orders. this paper addresses a new problem of online order fulfillment in omnichannel environment considering fulfillment options such as from store, fulfillment center, direct-to-customer center and vendor. particularly we address fulfillment, delivery, sourcing, inventory, shipping and fixed costs by proposing a mixed-integer profit maximization model, which is tested on small instances. for large scale randomly generated instances, we use bender’s decomposition to provide near optimal solution. the model assesses fulfillment decisions over multiple time periods to determine inventory needed to be shipped from vendor from different locations in retailer’s system. these product flow decisions in turn affect how much online demand that can be fulfilled profitably. in addition to the prime objective of profit maximization, the proposed model incorporates a lost-sale penalty towards balancing two conflicting requirements of profit maximization and lost sale minimization and to ensure long term customer relationship. finally, managerial insights are developed by evaluating operational and logistics cost and profitability for different fulfillment options.",bengaluru,,"kosha joshi, m. mathirajan department of management studies indian institute of science bengaluru, india koshajoshi@iisc.ac.in, msdmathi@iisc.ac.in",
1,Routes Optimization With Cluster-Dependent Costs For  Convenience Stores,"this study is carried out in a commercial company with a chain of convenience stores. the initial phase of the diagnosis aims to introduce the problem, show the analysis made on the process, and finally the identification of the root causes of the problem. the key solution was to create a two-phase model which includes an allocation of stores by demand, vehicle capacity and a time optimization model of the routes. vehicle routing problems (vrp) are usually optimized in function of the length of the resulting routes. these functions are expressed in terms of distance, time, fuel consumption, cost, emissions, etc. in this case, the cost of the route is given by the most expensive customer covered in such a route. in addition, the models proposed consider time windows constraints and heterogeneous fleet. all the necessary documentation under the company's scheme to implement the two-phase model and reduce travel expenses was developed this includes the restructuring of the daily route calculation and planning process with new contract terms and conditions that ensure greater benefits for the company. the results after the pilot test and simulations were a 16% reduction in final travel expenses and vehicle occupancy increased from 63% to 85%.","optimization, clustering","Within the planning stage, a robust, data-intensive analysis was conducted to determine the root causes of the problem. In the second stage, the complexity of the optimization model was addressed, with a review of routing literature where none addressed the problem of routes that do not depend on the client but on the cluster to which the client belongs. Then in the verification stage, the model was successfully developed and the objectives above five percentage points were met. Finally, all the pertinent bases were established for the following iterations of the PDCA cycle, which is the implementation and deployment of the tool. Throughout the project, different challenges were presented, firstly, learning a programming language from scratch, which involved a lot of study and practice time. On the other hand, the current world situation regarding covid-19 has led companies and universities to carry out their processes remotely, so it was necessary to create and adapt work strategies such as training, meetings with the client, data analysis, etc., 100% virtually. The development and growth of this project was of great interest and complexity, coupled with a great sense of satisfaction on the part of the team for all the knowledge acquired and enriching for each of the members.

2,Trading System Design Based On Cooperative Game For A  Two-Level Supply Chain,"supply chains of modular consumer electronics, such as lcd tvs, pcs, and smart phones have gradually changed from traditional vertical integration to horizontal division of labor. almost all the manufacturers of consumer electronics in japan have changed their sales channels from the affiliated electronics stores to large-scale retailers. therefore, their attentions on sales planning have been moved to negotiation with such large-scale retailers on trading price and volume. since the market power deviation, comparing with the retailers, manufacturers are getting difficult to achieve enough profits with the contract terms decided by negotiation. information asymmetry, market power deviation and pursuing self-interest only are considered as the main reasons of double marginalization (dm) phenomenon. in this study, after discussing the dm in a two-level supply chain which consists of a consumer electronics manufacturer and a retailer, a trading system based on cooperative game is proposed to eliminate the dm in order to help both players to build a win-win relationship. effectiveness on total profit of whole supply chain and profit of each player with the proposed trading system are confirmed by numerical experiments. products features as well as cost structurers features of manufacturer and retailer are considered to discuss the applicability.","negotiation, trading system, tokyo",,"kotomichi matsuno department of business design and management, graduate school of creative science and engineering, waseda university 3-4-1 okubo, shinjuku-ku, tokyo, japan sidiwu@aoni.waseda.jp",
3,A Framework To Develop And Evaluate Circular Economy  Readiness Within The Rail Sector,"the circular economy (ce) has been a policy initiative for supply chain looping strategies to reuse, refurbish, recycle, minimise, eliminate, share, and optimise material and energy use while maintaining firm profitability. nevertheless, it appears there is no unified reporting framework that defines how effective an organisation’s circular economy activity is. furthermore, such a framework requires systems-wide thinking and co-ordinated action across business, government and society. also, it appears there are no previous studies that have examined how an organisation’s ce effectiveness can be developed or measured specifically based upon systems theory. in particular, within the context of how an organisation designs itself, its products and services, such that it can continually adapt and remain viable and sustainable in the future. if organisations were concerned enough about their own viability in relation to the products and services they sell and the impact that they have on the environment, then their business strategies and plans would include evidence to continuously improving circular economic activity. if customers and regulators understood how effective an organisation’s products and services were in having a reduced or minimised impact, or better still, had a regenerative effect on the environment then this would create visibility of ce competition and ce value against incentives. to create a ce competitive environment, the products and services that form part of that ce competition relies upon ‘thinking in systems’. systems thinking is the ability to understand and/or design non-linear interdependencies of feedback relationships in context. for example, within a ce context, designing things for their next use, design for disassembly, maintaining the residual value of raw materials, designing products as an asset instead of a liability (to the environment) and designing products of service. as this research is still a work in progress, this paper does not aim to present a conclusive approach or methodology; rather, it presents a progressive step towards the development of a ce readiness framework within the rail sector. the longer-term aim for the outcome of the research in future will be to form the basis to enable a common platform to determine levels of ce value/competition not only within the rail sector but wider industry.","circular economy, system thinking, sustainability",,"carl waring college of science and engineering university of derby, derby, de22 3aw, uk c.waring@derby.ac.uk kapila liyanage college of science and engineering university of derby, derby, de22 3aw, uk k.liyanage@derby.ac.uk",
4,Internal And External Factors Of Improving Television   E-Waste Management Through The Supply Chain,"electronic waste (e-waste), also known as waste electrical and electronic equipment (weee), is one of the fastest- growing waste streams worldwide. e-waste has several risks to health, such as the release of toxic and hazardous compounds, water, soil, and air pollution. the risk of e-waste to communities and the environment has increased sharply with a lack of health and safety guidelines and inappropriate recycling techniques. there is a potential from weee that could provide employment opportunities for communities and generate economic benefits, such as precious metals, plastics, and glass. television waste is the largest contributor to electronic waste. the waste here is divided into cathode-ray tube (crt) and flat-panel display (fpd). good management also requires good supply chain management. infrastructure plays an important role in managing electronic waste. matrix swot analysis is used to determine strategies for improving television e-waste management through the supply chain infrastructure in jakarta. the results were; periodic outreach to the community, schools, and residents about the benefits and importance of electronic waste management, increasing cooperation with legal and certified waste processing companies, increasing the number of drop boxes in public areas and government agencies, and optimize e-waste collection by socializing and raising awareness.","e-waste, television, supply chain, infrastructure","Electronic waste has a dangerous impact on human health and the environment. The increasing number of electronic waste, especially television in Jakarta as the capital of the Republic of Indonesia, needs to be supported by electronic waste management. It aims to improve television e-waste management through the supply chain infrastructure in Jakarta. Because besides the dangers that lurk, there are also potential benefits from electronic waste management. From the results of the SWOT analysis, it was found that the analysis involved the identification of internal and external factors that support and do not support the improvement of sustainable electronic waste management. Periodic outreach to the community, schools, and residents about the benefits and importance of electronic waste management, increasing cooperation with legal and certified waste processing companies, increasing the number of drop boxes in public areas and government agencies, and optimize e-waste collection by socializing and raising awareness. By implementing this strategy, it is hoped that the improvement of television electronic waste management through the supply chain infrastructure in Jakarta can be realized.

5,Internal And External Factors Analysis Of Calibration  Laboratory Accreditation In Strengthening Indonesia,"quality infrastructure has an important role in supporting national economic development. the quality infrastructure consists of four core pillars: standards, accreditation, metrology, and conformity assessment services. iso/iec 17025: 2017 regulates general requirements for the competence of calibration laboratories. in several countries, the number of accredited calibration laboratories is only one-fifth of the testing laboratories. currently, there is not much research on calibration laboratories. calibration activities are an important part of the quality infrastructure system because incorrect calibration results can lead to the withdrawal of distributed products, and can lead to customer doubts about the quality of the products. the results of case studies in indonesia require additional accredited calibration laboratories for more than 49% of the current number. this indicates the very high need for calibration laboratories has not been supported by the growth in the number of laboratories. swot analysis can be used as a method to obtain internal and external factors in the accreditation of calibration laboratories in strengthening indonesia’s quality infrastructure. the results of the research show that factor “guarantee the validity of calibration result”, “lack of national metrology institute capabilities” and “pre-existing structure and facilitate” significantly related to calibration laboratory accreditation.","accreditation, accreditation","In several countries, the number of accredited calibration laboratories is only one-fifth of testing laboratories.

The results of statistical analysis show that “guarantee the validity of calibration result”, “lack of National Metrology Institute capabilities” and “pre-existing structure and facilitate” significantly contribute to calibration laboratory accreditation. The SWOT matrix can be a basis for determining the right strategy to increase calibration laboratory accreditation. From the results of this study, the Indonesian government and calibration laboratories must jointly implement strategies that have been formulated to increase the number of accredited calibration laboratories, so that they can meet calibration needs and can strengthen the quality infrastructure in Indonesia. Further research can be carried out by involving matching and evaluation techniques for each alternative strategy to obtain the best strategic priority.

6,"Identification Of Challenges And Benefits Of Product  Certification On Micro, Small, And Medium Enterprises","micro, small, and medium enterprises (msmes) in indonesia are an important factor in the indonesian economy. the total of msmes in indonesia reaches 64.2 million and msmes contribute 60.6% of indonesia's gross domestic product (gdp). increasing product competitiveness can be done through the implementation of standards, the fact that msme products have been standardized on products is that the products are certified (indonesian national standard). total msmes that have obtained product certification in indonesia are only 101 msmes out of the total number of msmes in indonesia which reaches 64.2 million. hence, research is needed identification interest in certification of msme products in indonesia according to the challenges and benefits of product certification. to obtain data, this paper undertakes a systemic review of the literature covering the challenges and benefits of product certification on msmes in indonesia to identify how challenges and benefits in the msmes, correlates with msmes survival improvement in the global competition. the results of the analysis of the obtained factors can be used as a basis for the right strategy to increase the product certification on msmes in indonesia.",,"This research is preliminary research on the challenges and benefits of product certification on micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in Indonesia. Initial identification based on a literature review can be used as a basis in determining the right strategy to increase the interest of MSMEs for their product certification in Indonesia by the Indonesian government and stakeholders. The challenges of product certification in MSMEs in general based on literature studies are lack of financial resources, lack of certification cost, low technological capability, lack of technical production, weak management and organizational capacity, and lack of qualified human resources (implement and maintain the certification). The benefit of product certification in MSMEs in general based on literature studies are Increase financial benefits, improve quality of the product, increase customer satisfaction (fewer complaints and retain customers), improve market access, improve the quality of organization management, and increase the company's competitiveness. For further studies, this research can also be carried out in other methods such as calculating statistically the challenges and benefits of product certification on micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in Indonesia.

7,Supply Chain Management In B2C E-Commerce:  Delineating Managers' Challenges,"this study aims to describe the practices and challenges of managing a supply chain of e-commerce in an emerging economy. studies have acknowledged that e-commerce requires distinct supply chain management; hence, this topic merits further investigation. as e-commerce is still a growing phenomenon in an emerging country, this study employs a phenomenology approach to reveal practitioners' experiences. this study uses a semi-structured interview to extract meaningful experiences from 17 practitioners responsible for managing the flow of e-commerce products. two main themes emerge from the in-depth interviews: the uniqueness of e-commerce business, especially compared to the conventional one, and the challenges of managing the e-commerce products, particularly in terms of work pressures, level of details, and the way to manage its human resources. this study proposes a preliminary framework of supply chain management and e-commerce business viability based on the findings.","e-commerce, business viability, phenomenology","This study reveals the practices and challenges of managing the supply chain of e-commerce in Indonesia. The ways of managing e-commerce logistics are essentially different from the traditional ones. Therefore, managers need some guidance from hands-on experience. The findings could enrich the management literature, specifically in supply chain management, and enhance the understanding of managers who are currently working or willing to join e-commerce. This study contributes to the literature by illuminating hands-on experiences in e-commerce and providing a fresh approach to investigating this growing phenomenon.

8,Tech Startup Failure In India: Do Lifecycle Stages Matter?,"tech startups bring innovative products and services to the market, and entrepreneurs manage numerous challenges across startups' lifecycle stages. more than 90% of the startups experience failure despite the support from a startup ecosystem, and therefore, it throws open the following research questions. why do tech startups fail? what are the causal attributes of startup failure across the lifecycle stages? what are the causal attributes that differentiate a failed tech startup from a successful one? against this backdrop, this comprehensive study explored the causal attributes of startup failures in india, with the following two specific objectives: (i) do causal factors vary within the lifecycle stage? and (ii) what are the attributes that differentiate a failed tech startup from a successful one? we gathered primary data from 151 cofounders and analyzed using binomial logistic regression and identified causal attributes of startup failures. the startup's lifecycle stage plays a significant role and implies how entrepreneurs prioritize and allocate resources to maximize their returns. the other causal attributes that are statistically significant are revenue, product market fit, product roadmap, market promotion, conflict with investors, level of confidence at execution, extent of focus on current startups, and entrepreneur’s experience level.","startup, causal attributes, failure, entrepreneurship",", contributions, and implications 6.1 Conclusions This research study started with the following two objectives. i. Do causal factors vary within the lifecycle stages? ii. What are the attributes that differentiate a failed tech startup from a successful one? To start with, we addressed the first objective. We have identified the causal attributes of emergence, stability, and growth stages to determine a successful startup compared to a failed one. The statistical significance of the models D1, D2, and D3 and the identification of statistically significant attributes paves the way for rejecting the null hypothesis. The emergence stage startups have minimal resources, and the need to remain focused on the milestones will help the startup to sail further. The cofounders with the required experience, should drive the startup unidirectionally and strive to deliver the product that meets market requirements at the right time. In the stability stage, startups scramble for the available resources to retain existing customers while attracting new customers for volume growth. One critical resource is financing and generating their funds through operational revenue, while exploring to obtain investor funds or seed grants from the ecosystem to spur growth. The entrepreneur's experience comes in handy in generating funds, avoiding conflicts with investors to navigate the startup to success. The growth stage startup entrepreneurs focus on the current startup, and a healthy level of confidence at the execution time is essential. Subsequently, we addressed the second objective. The statistical significance of model D4 and the identification of statistically significant attributes paves the way for rejecting the null hypothesis. The causal attributes' identification within the lifecycle stages provides a clear picture of managing the entrepreneurial journey. The startup's lifecycle stage plays a significant role (Bala Subrahmanya, 2017), and it implies how entrepreneurs prioritize and allocate their resources in maximizing the returns. The stage information helps in prioritizing internal firm-level resource allocation. The other causal attributes that are statistically significant are revenue, product market fit, product roadmap, market promotion, conflict with investors, level of confidence at execution, focus on current startup, and entrepreneur experience level. 6.2 Contributions This empirical study on tech startup failure has the following two key contributions. First, this study by lifecycle stage provides detailed insights on startup failures. The conceptual framework is replicable, scalable, and distinctly measurable for studying the startup failure phenomenon by lifecycle stages. Second, the identification of attributes impacting lifecycle stages will benefit the stakeholders, namely entrepreneurs, investors, and ecosystem policymakers. 6.3 Implications This empirical study on the tech startup life expectancy has the following implications. Entrepreneurs' awareness of startup failure's causal attributes by life cycle stages will help them explore their ideas rationally and reduce the socio- economic cost of startup failures. The policymakers of the Indian startup ecosystem are currently focussed on enabling the emergence of more startups. The stability and growth stage startups need more attention. Preventing the exit of grown-up startups is more critical, and policies should be tailored to support the lifecycle stages. 7","ganesaraman kalyanasundaram and mh bala subrahmanya department of management studies, indian institute of science, bengaluru, india ganesaramank@iisc.ac.in *, bala@iisc.ac.in sitaram ramachandrula [24]7.ai, bengaluru, india nagavenkata.r@247.ai * parts of this paper may form part of the corresponding author's ph.d. thesis submission at iisc, bengaluru",
9,Identification Of Success Factor For B2B E-Commerce In  Indonesia,the potential of b2b e-commerce is very promising with the development of information and communication technology nowadays. so far there have been several b2b e-commerce players trying to work on the indonesian market. the competition occurs among b2b e-commerce platform providers to fight for the potential of the b2b market in indonesia which is still classified as “green” with various challenges faced. this research was conducted to identify the success factors of b2b e-commerce market in indonesia by developing a questionnaire and implementing pairwise comparison matrix. the pairwise comparison matrix is used to determine the success factor for b2b e-commerce industry in indonesia. the result is infrastructure it is the most important success factor in developing b2b e-commerce in indonesia and government support is the least success factors in developing b2b e- commerce in indonesia.,"b2b, e-commerce","The B2B e-commerce industry become interesting object to research. With the development of the platform in Indonesia and the competition between B2B e-commerce provider, we find it important to identify the success factors for B2B e-commerce in Indonesia. To identify the success factors, we use pairwise comparison matrix and design the Hierarchy problem. The pairwise comparison matrix will identify the percentage of the success factor based on view from B2B e-commerce providers. The result shows that the factors affecting the success of B2B e-commerce in Indonesia from the most important to the least important are IT infrastructure, successful customer relationships, marketing and branding, security system and trust, social and cultural consideration, top management support, and government support. We also suggest doing the open question (qualitative method) while doing the quantitative interview to deep down the strategy that has been used from B2B e-commerce providers and the expectation of users.","lalita padmapuspita j, rahmat nurcahyo & djoko sihono gabriel industrial engineering departement universitas indonesia depok 16436, indonesia lalita.padmapuspita@ui.aci.id ; rahmat@eng.ui.ac.id ; dsihono@gmail.com",

11,Relationship Between The Power Law Distribution Of The  Number Of Tv Viewer'S Contact With Commercials And,"companies spend money on advertisements in the assumption that they will reach consumers, increase awareness of their brands and products, and induce the desired consumer purchasing behavior. however, when the relationship between advertising expenditures and sales or profits was investigated, the advertising elasticity of advertising expenditures (i.e., the effect on sales or profits when advertising expenditures are increased) was reported to be low (vacratasas and ambler, 1999). for example, graham and frankenberger (2000) investigated the impact of advertising expenditures of 320 companies listed on the u.s. securities market from 1985 to 1994 on their operating profits. the analysis revealed that the rate of change in advertising expenditures in periods t and t-1 has a positive impact on the operating profits of btoc companies in period t; however, the rate of change in advertising expenditures before t-2 had a small or no impact on the operating profits (period t). aaker and carman (1982) pointed out that there is a problem of over-advertising in practice as the effects of advertising expenditures on financial performance are unclear. then, how can companies set an appropriate amount for advertising expenses? if the number of contacts with advertisements shows a power-law distribution, it means that there are consumers with so much advertising exposure that it seems like an outlier, while there is a heavy tail of consumers who have almost no exposure to advertisements. this study aims to reconsider the advertising activities of companies based on this power-law distribution. the data used in the analysis are of tv commercials aired from january to march 2020 in japan: commercial placement history of each company by tv program and the tv viewing history of 2,500 survey respondents. we calculated the number of commercials that the 2,500 survey subjects were exposed to by using television programs as a key variable in the combining process. we then analyzed the data obtained by using r's ""the powerlaw"" package (gillespie, 2015). we found that the number of tv commercials contacts follows the power-law distribution.",tv commercials,,"advertising expenditure kizuna ueda, ayuko komura, and hirohisa hirai department of industrial engineering and management kanagawa university kanagawa, japan r201704520si@jindai.jp, komura-a@kanagawa-u.ac.jp, hirai@kanagawa-u.ac.jp",
12,Critical Success Factors During Execution Of Epcc   National Strategic Project In Indonesia,"a large of scaled development ongoing in industrial and infrastructure sectors in indonesia. the government has designated a number of those projects to become the national strategic project. some of the projects in the oil & gas industry include in the national strategic projects are categorized as megaprojects due to the cost of projects more than $ 1 billion. the scheme of projects is engineering, procurement, construction and commissioning (epcc) or turnkey projects. megaproject performance is considered disappointing due to almost of megaproject found will be over budget, delay and under quality. this performance is due to the complexity and uncertainty in megaprojects. megaprojects delay will become a problem for contractors, project owners, and the government. there are indications of problems related to the schedule, quality, and cost of the project in ongoing mega projects in indonesia. this research was led to analyze critical success factors during the engineering, procurement, construction, and commissioning phase of megaprojects in indonesia, by a literature review and developing questionnaire to people who involve during the execution of megaprojects as project owners and contractors. the results found that the financial aspects category is the most important category apart from other categories such as unexpected events and commissioning related factors.","megaprojects, epcc","This study aimed to understand the most important factor for the execution of megaproject strategic national in Indonesia. The authors believe that the research presented could be useful for EPCC contractors and project owners. EPCC contractors and project owners shall consider the financial aspects as the most critical category, and also consider other categories such as unexpected events, engineering, procurement, construction, project management aspects, and project characteristic as the important category during the execution of megaprojects. The authors also found that quality, cost, and schedule are criteria of megaprojects. Only 36,67% of the respondent that considered environmental sustainability as success criteria, it means that almost all megaprojects are not considering the sustainability of environmental as the parameter of success a megaproject. The research was limited to factors through literature review. In contrast, future research could observe other factors from more experienced management of EPCC contractors and project owners and experts on project managements. Besides the quantitative method, we also suggest using a qualitative method to explore mitigation from identified critical success factors which should be implemented by EPCC contractors to increasing the megaproject performance in Indonesia.

14,Misocp Relaxations For The Unit Commitment Problem  With Ac Power Flows,"in short-term electrical power systems planning, there are two fundamental problems: unit commitment (uc) and optimal power flow (opf). generally, these two problems are solved in a serial manner although the former contains a simplified version of the latter. in particular, the system operator solves the uc problem daily to decide which generators will be used for power generation in the next one or two days. then, the opf problem is solved in every 5-15 minutes to decide the amount of energy produced by each generator in order to satisfy the real time electricity demand. there are two approaches to solving opf problem: one uses the alternating current (ac) power flow equations, and the other one utilizes the direct current (dc) power flow approximation. since ac power flow equations introduce nonconvexities, it makes the problem more challenging. hence, the dc approximation of the power flow equations is generally used in the uc problem as a subproblem. however, this approach may lead to inaccurate generator commitment decisions, especially for congested power systems since it ignores the power losses in the network. thus, solving the uc problem with ac power flow equations as a mixed-integer nonlinear program (minlp) would be a better approach, however, there is only a limited number of studies in the literature utilizing this approach. in this work, our approach is to solve the uc problem with ac power flow equations to find a feasible schedule for both generation commitment status and power generation amounts simultaneously. we develop a base algorithm which consists of two phases. the first phase of the base algorithm solves a mixed-integer second order cone programming (misocp) relaxation of the uc problem with ac power flow equations. in the second phase, the optimal solution of the misocp relaxation, which provides the generator commitment statuses, are fixed and a multiperiod opf problem with ac power flow equations is solved using a local solver to find a feasible solution to the original minlp. hence, the algorithm outputs an upper bound in the second phase, and we compute its quality using the lower bound obtained in the first phase. in the computational experiments, the base algorithm provides promising results for small-size instances. however, for bigger instances, the misocp problem becomes challenging to solve. hence, we adopt a decomposition method and add valid inequalities originally derived for the uc problem with the dc power flow approximation. to obtain even better lower bounds, we strengthen the misocp relaxation by adopting the recent convexification approaches proposed for the socp relaxation of the opf problem. these additions to the base algorithm have led to an enhanced algorithm, which has promising outcomes for solving the uc problem with ac power flow equations in an efficient manner, with more accurate solutions compared to the existing methods from the literature.",,,"deniz tuncer and burak kocuk industrial engineering program sabancı university istanbul, turkey dtuncer@sabanciuniv.edu, burak.kocuk@sabanciuniv.edu",
15,Improving Software Security In Extremeprogramming  Methodology.,"agile software development has been used by business to produce a more adaptable and simple software development process, i.e. making it possible to develop software at a faster rate and with more agility during development. there are however concerns that the higher complexity, refactoring rate, and lack of documentation are creating less secure software. software security in other hand is one of the most important factors in software projects success, but it costs more time and effort in the software development life cycle and increases the overall complexity of the software project. in this paper, the authors suggest some methodologies that may enhance the overall software security by implementing them into extreme programming (xp) life cycle.","extreme programming, pair programming, security education","Security is an important quality aspect of software systems. Considering security at early stages of SDLC is an important factor dealing with software security issues. In this paper, some security ideas have been proposed to increase the security level in XP, to ultimately improve the security of the software product, by involving a security specialist (ethical hacker) in the whole XP development stages, and by introducing special security education for the software development team programmers and a basic security education for the rest of the team including the involved customer personnel. On the other hand, introducing the security threat modeling as a conceptual view for the expected threat attack points and flow is an important step to implement. Other steps such as introducing the heterogeneous architecture to handle the unexpected technical or security bugs and introducing the security-based pair programming to handle the logical and security code errors, to lower down the security and code review cost and time. Vulnerability testing has been used as security unit and integration test, without increasing the refactoring time. Another test, called white box penetration test which is considered as security acceptance test, to ensure that the security requirements are met. Finally, black box penetration test executed by an external ethical hacker to simulate an external black hat attack, revealing any unexpected or miss-resolved security threat. 5.",,
16,Measuring Sustainability Performance Of Logistics Service  Providers Using Ahp,"many manufacturers and retailers often outsource their logistics functions to logistics service providers (lsps) to focus more on their core business process. due to the competitiveness and the popularity of the sustainability concept, those organizations evaluate their prospective lsps not only based on economic aspects like cost, service quality but also on social and environmental aspects as well. this paper proposes a model that can be used by organizations when evaluating and selecting lsps based on their sustainability performance. along with the traditional three dimensions of sustainability, a new dimension of information technology (it) is incorporated into the model. a composite sustainability performance index (cspi) is constructed using the analytical hierarchy process (ahp) as a weighting method and linear aggregation method since multiple dimensions and indicators need to be incorporated when measuring sustainability performance. the proposed model is flexible as it depends on the sustainability requirements of the organization when selecting lsps and their relative importance of the sustainability dimensions and indicators are up to the organization to decide. the proposed model is applied to an apparel manufacturing organization to evaluate and select their prospective lsps.","composite index, sustainability","This paper proposes a model (CSPI) to evaluate the logistics service providers based on their sustainability performance.

18,Analysis Of Supply Chain Complexity Sub-Dimensions For  Automobile Industry,"there is plenty of literature available that accounts for complexity management in a supply chain. a major fraction of this literature takes into account numerous parameters in order to devise management techniques. however, multiple such parameters do not directly affect the result and incorporating these can make the analyses overly complicated. most of the causes of supply chain inefficiencies are due to the interconnectedness and interdependencies in the structure, processes and environment of the supply chains. the level of complexity varies across industries in terms of intensity and ease of management. after a review of the literature related to complexities in supply chains of the automobile industry, the paper attempts to build a framework to study the relative significance of these complexities. this paper aims to identify critical complexities for automobile industry. understanding and controlling these complexities open avenues for better supply chain management and also assist decision-makers in formulating risk mitigation strategy.",services,"These illustrations and tables help us identify the top complexity criteria from an expansive and exhaustive list of complexities identified before. This criterion has huge implications.We can reduce complicacies within a supply chain by acting on these easy to manage complexities. The analysis done clearly divides complexities into regions of high and low intensity as well as easy and tough to manage. These bifurcations help understanding complexity trends within different sectors of a supply chain as well as across supply chains for different industries. The visual analysis of 5 point mapping diagrams helps us find four distinct zones in which complexity sub-sub-dimensions can be divided, of these zones the most critical one for our research is the one having high complexity intensity and high ease of managing complexity sub-dimensions. Though this analysis gives multiple insights into supply chain complexities, it does not quantify the relative importance of the highlighted complexity sub-dimensions. For future work on this, a quantitative approach, to rank the chosen sub-dimensions may be adopted, to get a clearer picture for introducing complexity mitigation strategies for different industries. This multi- criteria ranking could be implemented using approaches such as TOPSIS, Fuzzy Promethee or Fuzzy AHP.

19,Design And Simulation Of A Standalone Pv  System For A Mosque In Neom City,"the current state and the future potentials of renewable energy have increased widely globally to reduce the usage of other resources such as fossil fuel, which affect the environment. neom city in the kingdom of saudi arabia (ksa) is a case where renewable energy will count for 100% of its energy consumption. solar energy will play a prominent role in neom city. this project aims to present a design and simulation of a standalone photovoltaic (pv) system for a mosque located in neom city to meet the people's need for electricity. the system harvests solar energy and converts it into electrical energy to cover the electrical power needed for a typical mosque in neom. the design and simulation have been implemented using pvsyst software, powerful software for designing, simulating and generating pv systems reports. the designed standalone pv system could produce yearly electrical energy of 300 mwh. this study's significance relies on initiating research and development of building pv systems to harvest solar energy in neom city.","renewable energy, solar energy, solar pv plant, neom city",,"amani alzahrani, mashael rajeh, shaima banjar master of energy engineering students, college of engineering effat university jeddah, 22332, ksa amaalzahrani@effat.edu.sa, marajeh@effat.edu.sa, sabanjar@effat.edu.sa tayeb brahimi energy and technology lab college of engineering effat university jeddah 22332, ksa tbrahimi@effatuniversity.edu.sa",
20,Production Sequence Using Simulation Techniques:  Case Study Of Mineral Production Plants For Dairy Cow,"the objective of this research was to apply the flexsim® simulation program to find the most suitable production sequence for a case study factory. the researchers experimented and found the most appropriate production sequence by entering 25 orders, the total production amount of 520 tons into the simulation model and experimenting with the production order of earliest due date (edd), longest processing time (lpt) and first come first serve (fcfs) by experimenting with 30 replications in each format. based on the analysis of the experimental results, it was found that the edd production sequence has the least makespan time of 164.170 hours and without a tardy job. whiles the lpt production sequence has a makespan time of 166.545 hours and the number of tardy jobs is 74 tons. the fcfs production sequence has a makespan time of 163.641 hours and the number of tardy jobs is 59 tons. from the simulation results, considering the smallest makespan time and the least tardy job, the edd production sequence is most suitable because the makespan time is 164.170 hours which is the second smallest production time and without a tardy job which is the least amount of delay from all 3 forms of the production sequence.","simulation, sequence, the us (19.50%)","From the study, it was revealed that the main issue of the case study factory was designing and planning the production process by their own experiences; they mainly restricted the delivery date and the number of finished products. Moreover, resource planning and preparation were difficult because the actual daily consumption of resources is not known. From the above problems, the simulation model is suitable for the production process planning. Applying simulation techniques is beneficial for the development of a production sequence. The model can be used for various situations and conditions without affecting the actual production system. Furthermore, the model can predict the start and end time of the production. This information will lead to an effective production plan. Moreover, the simulation techniques can be applied to complex solutions which take time to figure out. The effective application of the simulation model also depends on the purpose of its implementation.

21,Thermodynamic Evaluation Of A Solar Based Kalina Cycle,"solar energy has enormous potential in the world. it can produce energy generation several times larger than the overall world energy demand. however, a major challenge to implement it is the high costs of electricity generation from solar sources. these costs can be reduced by improving the conversion efficiency from solar energy to electrical energy. currently, the rankine cycle is the most frequently used power cycle for generating electricity from solar energy. an interesting alternative to the commonly used rankine cycle that uses solar heat energy as its input is the kalina cycle. the kalina cycle uses a mixture of ammonia and water as its working fluid. when using a mixture of ammonia and water as a working fluid, temperature varies while heat is added and rejected during phase change. this theoretically would be more efficient than a power cycle who only uses water as its working fluid. this paper examines the performance of a kalina cycle with solar energy from concentrating solar plant as the input heat. a solution algorithm is developed and programmed to evaluate the thermodynamic properties of a kalina cycle with inlet turbine temperature of 400 °c. parametric analysis was done to study the effects of turbine inlet pressure and turbine inlet ammonia concentration on cycle efficiency. results shows that both parameters have a positive relationship with cycle efficiency. turbine outlet pressure was found to be a major influence on cycle efficiency. maximum efficiency was found to be 33% at a turbine inlet pressure of 140 bar and turbine inlet ammonia concentration of 0.8.","kalina cycle, solar energy, efficiency, recuperator","Solar energy has great potential to power the Nation. Currently, the cost of implementing solar technologies are heavily influenced by the power cycle efficiency. The Kalina cycle provides an alternative to the conventional Rankine cycle that is often used. The Kalina cycle has the option of using an ammonia-water mixture as its working fluid. Ammonia- water mixture is a zeotropic mixture and its ability to lose heat are increased due to the variable temperature boiling process of ammonia water. This could provide a better cycle efficiency compared to the Rankine cycle. This ammonia- water mixture can operate up to temperatures of 400 °C. This value can be readily generated through available concentrating solar power technologies such as parabolic trough collectors and linear Fresnel reflectors.

22,Design Of Water Treatment Facilities For Integrated Areas Of  Office And Residential Buildings In Jakarta,"the scarcity of clean water is one of the main problems faced by big cities like jakarta. with the density of population and office buildings, it is difficult to fulfill clean water. one of the difficulties in meeting the need for clean water is pt bm, which is a state-owned company that is building an area containing offices and residences for employees. the water requirement per day for the area is 370 m3/day, while the water supply available is from regional drinking water company only 100 m3/day. the deficiency of 270 m3/day of clean water can be met by reprocessing wastewater from office buildings and residential in the areas. the wastewater treatment system in this study uses a reverse osmosis system. the results of the research prove that the treated water of reverse osmosis can be used along with the water from drinking water company for building’s clean water.","wastewater reuse, greywater, blackwater, reverse osmosis","Apart from water that comes from drinking water companies, the way to overcome water needs due to scarcity for office and residential buildings is to use wastewater from the building itself. Wastewater resulting from the use of water in buildings is very large, about 80% of the total use, it would be a loss if this wastewater was disposed of just like that. Treatment techniques using a reverse osmosis system can be used as an advanced treatment of standard wastewater installation systems in each building. The quality of the treated water results can meet the standards to be used as clean water for all building uses, however, reject water from the RO system can only be used as water that is not directly related to humans because there is a residual content from the processed water. Further, processing is required if the reject water is to be reused as clean building water.","mochamad agmarnosa, rahmat nurcahyo & m. dachyar industrial engineering department universitas indonesia depok 16436, indonesia mochamad.agmarnosa@ui.ac.id ; agmarnosa@gmail.com ; rahmat@eng.ui.ac.id ; mdachyar@yahoo.com",
23,Critical Success Factors Of   E-Commerce Collaboration In Indonesia,"e-commerce development in indonesia continues to be the center of southeast asia's attention, with its potential in both b2b and b2c models. with predicted growth up to us $ 300 billion in 2020, many e-commerce aims to create new value in a new product/service. it is widespread for startup e-commerce launch partnerships or collaboration programs to increase e-commerce opportunities to grow even more. some e-commerce has launched their collaboration program with significant results in quality growth. the decision making in e-commerce collaboration tends to be intuitive, centralized, and not using strategic management tools. this research aims to identify critical success factors (csf) as primary considerations in making collaborative decisions between e-commerce companies by developing a questionnaire with employees and decision-makers using toe framework in e-commerce collaborations. the object of this research is b2b and b2c company that conducted collaboration partnership in the last 1 year. while research limited to ranking of csfs, further studies by using another method need to be conducted for more comprehensive analysis.","e-commerce, partnership, or startup","This study aimed to understand the vital rank of CSF for e-commerce collaboration with partners. To achieve this goal, the authors researched both e-commerce and partner parties. Research also ignored the business model such as B2B, B2C, or C2C. The authors believe that the study presented could be useful for e-commerce organizations. E-commerce could consider two critical factors (strategy for revenue sharing and channel distribution) for future decision making. By observing the TOE framework, the environment framework has moderate to null importance according to the result. This result defined that for both e-commerce and partners, technology and organization are the far more important framework to be considered before conducting the collaboration. The research was limited to factors through literature review. In contrast, future research could observe other factors from more experienced management of e-commerce and partner, expert, and business owner of e- commerce. Further discussion for this research is to find a qualitative method for the factors affecting e-commerce collaboration. Thus, creating a complete result for decision making for e-commerce. This research's limitation is that the authors only calculate each factor using geomean and rank from the gap between two parties. The authors suggest using other methods, such as the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), to deeply analyze decision-making factors in e-commerce collaboration and getting more insights into what other factors should be considered for e- commerce collaboration apart from implementing the TOE framework or not.","prawira adi putra, rahmat nurcahyo & farizal department of industrial engineering universitas indonesia salemba, jakarta, indonesia prawira.adi91@ui.ac.id; rahmat@eng.ui.ac.id; farizal@eng.ui.ac.id",

25,Maintenance Practices In Indonesian Wood And Furniture  Smes: Survey Results,"the importance of maintenance arises over time due to the more advancement in technology and the higher demands where downtimes could ruin the business. the proper maintenance management will maximize the business profit and also offer a competitive advantage. this paper aims to identify the key ingredients of successful maintenance practices within the indonesian wood and furniture industry through a survey of 35 industries. the t-test results show that all factors are significantly related to highly effective maintenance management. to study the relationship between maintenance success factors, the pearson-correlation test was applied. the results show three strong correlations, i.e., the maintenance planning and scheduling - organization; maintenance approach - maintenance planning and scheduling; and maintenance approach - financial aspect. these three strong correlations can be an effective maintenance strategy to reduce the risk of tool and machine failure. a radar diagram shows the average status of maintenance management in the indonesian wood and furniture industries. it shows that, on average, the respondents were “excellence,” who are fully or almost entirely adopting proper maintenance practice and have excellent performance in that particular aspect. on average, the respondents are fully aware of the maintenance practice importance as fundamental for their business success.","survey, indonesia, furniture industry","and Further Work Maintenance practice is important in the wood and furniture sector. The performance of the furniture industry and SMEs cannot be separated from effective management. This study presents the results of a survey regarding maintenance practices in SMEs and the furniture industry in Indonesia. There are 5 maintenance factors, consisting of 49 variables that are included in the questionnaire. The test analysis shows that all factors are significantly related to highly effective maintenance management, i.e. organization, maintenance planning and scheduling, financial aspect, maintenance approach, and human resources management. Based on the Pearson-correlation test, maintenance planning and scheduling and organization, maintenance approach and maintenance planning and scheduling, and maintenance approach and financial aspect, these three pairs have a strong correlation which are positively correlated, that can be effective maintenance strategy to reduce the risk of tool and machine failure. The radar chart also shows that in general, Indonesia's maintenance practices fall into the ""Excellence"" category. This means that furniture organizations in Indonesia are already practicing good maintenance management. This research has certain limitations in the selection of industrial areas, the number of samples, and so on. Therefore, for further research, it is hoped that the following elements can be considered in the research: (1) Increase the number of samples. This study can only study a questionnaire to 35 organizations. In fact, in reality the organization of wood and furniture in Indonesia is much bigger. The greater the number of samples, the level of accuracy of the results will increase. (2) Conduct an interview. Due to time limitation, this study can only conduct a survey via questionnaire without structured interviews with respondents regarding understanding of maintenance.","fathia nisa1, ghina haura tsamarah2, nadia farah afief3, zarahmaida taurina4 department of industrial engineering universitas indonesia depok, 16424, indonesia fathia.nisa@ui.ac.id1, ghina.haura@ui.ac.id2, nadia.farah91@ui.ac.id3, zarahmaida.taurina91@ui.ac.id4",
26,Outsourcing Life Cycle Model For Financial Services   In The Fintech Era,"in today’s financial services landscape, staying ahead of the innovation curve and being disciplined at enhancing core service offerings entail careful resource planning. a well-structured outsourcing arrangement can go a long way towards enhancing long term organizational strategic growth. in the post-2014 fintech era, (i) strategic management with an innovation focus and (ii) financial technology-associated risks, have brought about changes to outsourcing in the financial services industry. presently, most outsourcing life cycle models in existing literature seek to provide comprehensive, yet industry-neutral guidelines lacking industry context and depth of coverage. a newly licensed financial institution deciding to embark on outsourcing but is uncertain about how to thread the increasingly complex fintech and financial regulatory landscape, will likely find domain-specific outsourcing life cycle models useful. a more targeted financial services outsourcing life cycle approach, with a focus on strategy and risk management in today’s context, can contribute more effectively to the application and review of outsourcing implementation. this research contributes to present literature by proposing a new strategy-risk outsourcing life cycle model. this is an elegant and simple-to-use end-to-end framework which can be utilized by the financial services industry to guide outsourcing decisions. the paper also recommends areas for future research.","outsourcing, fintech, financial services, life cycle model",,"tristan lim school of business management nanyang polytechnic singapore tris02@gmail.com, tristan_lim@nyp.edu.sg patrick thng school of information systems singapore management university singapore patrickthng@smu.edu.sg",

29,Building A Model For Detecting Accounting Fraud In Tokyo  Stock Exchange Listed Companies Using Machine Learning,"accounting fraud greatly undermines the credibility of accounting information and carries an immeasurable impact on the market and economy. many researchers have conducted theoretical studies to clarify the mechanism of accounting fraud and its economic impact. furthermore, based on theoretical research, empirical studies are being conducted to detect companies that engage in accounting fraud (e.g., beneish, 1999; dechow et al., 2011; perols, 2011; purda and skillicorn, 2014). in addition, shuto et al. (2016) and ushuki et al. (2019) study the detection model of accounting fraud for japanese firms. dechow et al. (2011) conducted a representative study that developed a detection model of accounting fraud. dechow et al. (2011) summarized the characteristics of accounting fraud firms based on the previous practices of accounting fraud. they then identified five factors that influence the occurrence of accounting fraud and reflect the characteristics. finally, 28 variables corresponding to the five factors were developed, and a detection model was attempted to be constructed using the variables. as a result, they concluded that the f-score obtained from the detection model is effective in detecting accounting fraud. the study by shuto et al. (2016) aimed to detect accounting fraud in japanese firms. they added the variables 1) real activities manipulation, 2) conservatism, and 3) general business corporation shareholding to the detection model of dechow et al. (2011). the results of the analysis confirmed that the additional variables are effective in discriminating the accounting fraud practices prevalent in japanese firms. however, the limitation of these studies is that the variables considered are limited to those set up based on theoretical studies. in recent years, it is said that companies have diversified the purposes of accounting fraud (suda et al., 2007). for example, an accounting fraud was carried out for maintaining or inflating stock prices and winning public works orders. if the purpose of accounting fraud is diversified, the methods and timing of accounting manipulation may also be diversified. accounting researchers are required to contribute to this situation by converting a huge amount of corporate information data into variables and finding useful variables to improve the detection accuracy. this study aims to develop a detection model of accounting fraud based on the diversified purposes of accounting fraud. to do so, we use machine learning method. the reason for this is that technical problems have emerged in the logit models that were conducted in previous studies, especially when the company information is variable as much as possible and the search for specific variables is effective in improving the detection accuracy. this is also because it may exhibit aspects that go beyond the nonlinearity assumed by the logit model. a machine learning based accounting fraud detection model was constructed for companies listed on the tokyo stock exchange from 2008–2018. during this period, we observed 330 fraudulent and 17,194 non-accounting fraud firms. as a result, the detection accuracy of our study's accounting fraud detection model was higher than that of shuto et al.

Thus, researchers found that using the proposed check-out counter has no action required since it is improved and developed through changing the dimensions and adding features. Besides, the Rapid Entire Body Assessment result shows that there is a high risk. It should investigate and implement Change. Similar to the OWAS, this study uses the said result for the improvements. The proposed design will satisfy the performance of the cashiers based on the results of the ergonomic tools and surveys. Also, it will address the issue regarding the social distancing protocol because researchers believe that COVID-19 can acquire in check-out counters. Hence, it will have significant changes and improvements. The researcher concludes that the current check-out counter design must improve and innovate design that will fit in the new normal, reduce and prevent musculoskeletal disorders, and attain adequate work performance.","body assessment (reba) alfred joshua s. aquino, roland b. batucal and edlyn d. pangilinan industrial engineering department technological institute of the philippines 363 p. casal, quiapo metro manila, philippines majsaquino@tip.edu.ph , mrrbbatucal@tip.edu.ph , medpangilinan@tip.edu.ph janina elyse a. reyes industrial engineering department technological institute of the philippines 363 p. casal, quiapo metro manila, philippines janina.elyse.reyes@gmail.com",
31,Strategic Development For A Filter Automotive  Component Company In Facing The Electric Vehicles Era,"many countries have supported the development of sustainable technology in the automotive sector by making innovations for electric vehicles (ev). indonesia is one of the countries that supports this program. with this program, it is estimated that 30% of automotive component suppliers in indonesia will disappear because evs have fewer components than current conventional vehicles. the filter is one of the automotive components that are directly related to the internal combustion engine (ice) for conventional vehicles. by conducting a case study approach to a filter manufacturer and formulating the ie matrix. the result shows that threats regarding government regulations for electric cars can be overcome by other policies regarding biofuels that still use filters in the engine combustion process because natural resources from its country, economic condition, and growth rate in indonesia also are good opportunities for the external factors. the company's internal capabilities greatly affect the company's readiness. marketing, financial, and research and development aspects have a strong correlation with the company's strategy in facing the electric vehicles era in the future, therefore the choices for this company are quietly much those are integration strategy, market penetration, market development, and product development.","filter, electric vehicle","After getting the scores from the analysis based on the External and Internal Factors, then the next step is conducting the guidance based on the IE (Internal External) matrix from the weight of values obtained to determine which quadrant of the IE value weight is. The IFE total weighted score indicated 2.941 points and the EFE weighted score indicated 3.03 point, which means the filter company can be described in a build and grow area, therefore the choices for this company is quietly much those are Backward, Forward, or Horizontal Integration, Market Penetration, Market Development, and Product Development. Based on a survey conducted, threats regarding government regulations regarding electric cars can be overcome by other policies regarding biofuels that still use filters in the engine combustion process. Apart from that the strength on Indonesia's GDP as well as the growth rate also affects the upcoming external factors for the company. 2 invalid statements in this study regarding the selection of the automotive sector and the decrease in consumption activity do not correlate with opportunities or external threats for the company. On the internal side, the company's internal capabilities greatly affect the company's readiness to face the era of electric vehicles. Marketing, financial, and research and development aspects have a strong correlation with the company's strategy in facing the era of electric vehicles in the future, and aspects of production and information systems do not have a strong correlation with the development of this strategy. Future studies can explore the new finding for automotive component manufacturers based on ICE on a growing or medium scale. It is interesting to explore how medium companies can develop strategies to survive in facing the electric vehicles era in the future.","in indonesia hikari qurrata’ain nurhadi, rahmat nurcahyo, and djoko sihono gabriel industrial engineering departement universitas indonesia depok 16436, indonesia hikari.qurrataain@ui.ac.id, rahmat@eng.ui.ac.id, gabriel@ie.ui.ac.id",

With the sudden jolt of the pandemic, the standard safety protocols in wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) are not met along with the procurement of more supplies for that reason, everyone is trying to do their best to manage with whatever supplies are present at hand. In the result of the survey, there are still people who believe that isolation tents implement visitor guidelines that well, but the majority believe that yes there exist visitor guidelines but it didn’t reach their expectations. To ensure a more efficient and safe operation of isolation tents, it is more of the process and design of the tents that are important. An isolation tent for this kind of highly contagious disease must have top quality of proper lighting and ventilation, electricity, help desk, I.T. access, separate entrance and/or exits, adequate spacing of accommodations. Additionally, the researchers believe that improving the isolation tents will definitely help in faster recovery of the patients, and having a more efficient process will make it easier for everyone. And with the faster recovery and efficiency of the system, hopefully that it will help the country to return to normal and cope up with the damages and loss that this pandemic has brought.

As you can see in the exterior, it is securely covered, so that contaminations will not leak inside or outside of the tent. 
It also has donning area which is meant for health care workers so that they could put on their PPE. Doffing area, to 
put off their PPE. Patient flow will be from left and straight ahead, while health care worker from right and ahead. It 
is important that it has different places to put on and off the PPE because used PPE shouldn’t be mixed with the clean 
PPE for sanitation purposes. The improved design of the isolation tent also has small storage area, where can also hold 
off workers who will enter the tent, and in front of it is the washing area, so that workers can clean their hands before 
going to the donning area. The storage for some basic medicines, apparatus, and supplies for the tent. Separate 
lavatories for the patients and health care workers. The researchers also added a waiting area so that visitors of the 
patients have a place to stay in while waiting. The innovated tent also considers barriers of opaque and transparent 
plastic between patients, to provide privacy and of course, good lighting and proper ventilation.

36,Analyzing Feasible Renewable Energy Policies : Uae  Electricity Authorities,"over the past few decades, the impact of energy demand on the environment has increased global nations focus on sustainability efforts to reduce greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions that required intervention and a shared sense of responsibility. the need for a long-term sustainable energy policy became of high importance due to the increasing co2 emissions and the rising marginal cost of natural gas supply, which is the primary backbone of the uae domestic energy system. the uae government recognized the need to deploy renewable energy to address climate change and co2 emission problem by diversifying their energy resources, but the critical challenge is to minimize the gap between re policy formulation and actual implementation. this study conducts intensive research to support solar energy deployment in the uae by introducing a framework to promote feasible re policy mechanisms that can be implemented to break up the monopoly. therefore, the research intends to assist uae electricity authorities in considering re policies to meet the energy demand by taking advantage of uae's abundant solar irradiance, which reduces the dependence on fossil fuels. however, the paper's main findings indicate re policies to promote sustainability deployment, including feed-in-tariffs (fit), net metering, re auctions (tendering), quotas, and tax credits. in contrast, a mixed fit policy and quota policy is recommended for the uae's electricity sector whereas the significant factors influencing re development are geographical, economic, technological, environmental, and political factors.","energy demand, sustainability, social advancement","This research focused on the UAE's need to deploy RE resources to address climate change and CO2 emission problem by diversifying their energy resources. Thus, after viewing the UAE's energy sector, solar energy can be adopted for electricity generation to meet the electricity demand effectively. The UAE has the potential to take advantage of the abundant solar energy as it lies within the solar belt. The utilization of RE sources can help sustain the future of the UAE's electricity needs by harnessing abundant natural energy resources. Thus, to efficiently utilize grid-tied solar energy, feasible renewable energy policies are needed to address energy development to sustain its growth, including energy production, distribution, and consumption. The worldwide comparative RE analysis listed the RE policy mechanisms for many countries that were successfully implemented in meeting the national targets, whereas FITs are the most deployed. Throughout this study, a set of factors, policy mechanisms, drivers, and challenges to RE deployment are developed. The main research findings are summarized in table 2 to outline the research intension in assisting UAE electricity authorities in considering RE policies to meet the increasing demand by taking advantage of the abundant solar irradiance to reduce the dependence on fossil fuels. Also, table 2 summarizes the main challenges tackled from literature and ways to overcome them. Having examined the main RE challenges and barriers, the need for formulating energy policy in UAE is mandatory to encourage the transition of renewable energy development by ensuring that policies would overcome the existing structural weakness.

They are considered together with two control strategies implemented to reduce the number of cancer cells and tumor cells and cost of treating breast cancer. The results show that optimal control of breast cancer is possible through surgery at initial stage and anti-cancer drugs. Invasive breast cancer may be occur again agfter surgery, Tamoxifen drug (anti-cancer drug) works on the whole body and blocks the effects of estrogen. The combination of those control strategies is needed for better results. However, support to the implementation of the control strategies against breast cancer should be encouraged to reduce the burden of the disease on the economy of the countries.","tahera parvin and md. haider ali biswas mathematics discipline science engineering and technology school khulna university khulna-9208, bangladesh moly151245@gmail.com, mhabiswas@yahoo.com",

43,Ergonomic Interventions For Designing The Workstation Of A  Manual And Highly Repetitive Lifting Task In A Paint,"the filling station plays a substantial role in the paint manufacturing industry where manual activities are omnipresent. an ergonomic study was conducted at the filling station of a renowned paint factory in bangladesh since this factory includes numerous manual activities. a highly repetitive manual lifting job was selected among those tasks for measuring the lifting index (li) as a mean of quantifying the risk since that continuous lifting job looked susceptible to musculoskeletal disorders and lower back pain. the vli (variable lifting index) method which takes biomechanical, physiological, and psychophysical into account was used for determining the li. the value of the li for the existing layout was found to be greater than 1, bearing the significance that this task can be the impetus to back pain in the future. to resolve the problem, an improved optimized ergonomic design was suggested that could lower the li to a safe level (li < 1). the implementation of the improvised design will lessen the risk of lower back pain for the workers performing that task.",ergonomics,"In conclusion, it is found that ergonomic interventions for designing the workstation did reduce the risks associated with a manual and highly repetitive lifting task. The result shows that existing design could contribute to low back pain or musculoskeletal injuries in the workplace. The recommended design proposed a simple modification of the design parameters and mitigated the overall risks. Therefore, to obtain accurate estimates of the effect of ergonomic interventions on design, it is essential to closely simulate the work station and workplace situation of interest in a virtual environment or test experiment, performed by workers who have experience with the particular lifting task. Moreover, the design parameters can be changed simultaneously to investigate the effects and optimize the overall lifting situation by determining the optimum design parameters for alleviating the risks for LBP or MSDs.","industry afifa sumaya, aquib irteza reshad, nowsheen sharmili, muniom shahriar department of industrial and production engineering bangladesh university of engineering and technology dhaka, 1000, bangladesh eyantitushi@gmail.com, reshad10810@gmail.com, n7sharmili@gmail.com, mridulthegreat69@gmail.com",

It is achieved by using ergonomic tools for computation such as Ergonomic Checklist for Computer (VDT) Workstation and Ovako Working Posture Analysis System (OWAS) wherein they indicated that corrective action is required shortly. OWAS and REBA are the most appropriate tools to evaluate and re-design comfortable workstation for employees experiencing awful workstation. To develop and innovate a proposed design of work from home employee's workspace. By assessing the needs and current condition of work from home employees through the VDT checklist and OWAS, determining the features and dimensions that needed to give emphasis became possible to create the proposed work spaced design. To determine how important matters such as space of the workplace, the material needed, length of the table, the height of the chair, and lighting may affect the employees’ overall performance. Conducting a comparative analysis for current and ideal working posture and workspace was taken into consideration in determining the needs that are used in the proposed workspace design. In a comparative analysis, analyzing the difference between the current and ideal workspace was taken into contemplation. To analyze the importance of visual interference, manipulation, and body support in improving the workspace of work from home employees ergonomically Considering the factors in terms of visual interference, manipulation, and body support helps in computing the average anthropometric dimensions for both male and female in determining the design dimension. Summarizing the research study showed how the researchers applied their knowledge in course ergonomics by using ergonomic tools such as Ergonomic Checklist for Computer (VDT) Workstation and Ovako Working Posture Analysis System (OWAS). 5.2 Conclusion The researchers came up in improving workstation because of the new normal that the company really deal with these days. And with the help of ergonomic workstation improved design that will be able for the employer to help their employees who are working-from-home to consider the measurements of every suggestion that the researchers suggested based from the research results. The newly designed set-up or guidelines of the workplace for the employer for them to consider and to distribute to their company employees would result in a positive outcome to overcome the common problems that most of the employees encounter that could give improvement and a worthy change for most of the employees which will make them feel motivated, productive, safe and comfortable on working from home in this new normal. 5.3 Recommendations The researchers recommend based on the data from the anthropometric measurements results that is best for adjusting the office workstation for the employers for their employees. The employers should increase awareness of existing and potential ergonomic issues in the office, knowing how to adjust the office workstation to fit the office worker, using proper work practices, and following a proven ergonomic improvement process within the organization can improve overall comfort and productivity at work. Further research, the workstation that has chair, desk, mouse, keyboard, and other items should be optimally designed and positioned based on the tasks performed, specific body measurements, and personal factors that only a well-trained ergonomist can determine, evaluate, and synthesize.

47,"Relationships Of Environmental Pollution, Economic Cost,  And Public Health: A Structural Equation Modeling Study","this paper extents the research on the relationship of economic cost and the effects on public health of environmental pollution in philippine context based on the respondents’ awareness, perception and attitude through structural equation modeling. quantitative method was utilized in the study by selecting four hundred filipino respondents to complete a five-section survey which included a likert-scale indicating the constructs of the main latent variables. the results were drafted and analyzed using confirmatory factor analysis in structural equation modeling (sem). the re-specified model proves that 5 latent variables have significant effects to each other as they are observed to have direct and indirect relationships. it is further concluded that awareness on environmental condition can impact the perceived effect of it to both public health and economy, and this perception can both lead to positive attitude towards environmental protection. results also shows that the costs of environmental pollution to philippine economy in terms of public health is inevitable and unambiguous and one method to estimate it is through health care expenditure attributed to pollution.","economic cost, public health","The research tool verified the items that are essential indicators of the recognized unobserved variables. It proves that the 5 latent variables namely, Awareness on Current Environmental Condition; Perceived Effect of Environmental Pollution to Public Health; Perceived Effect of Environmental Pollution to Economy; Attitude towards Environmental Protection and Public Health; and Attitude towards Environmental Protection and Economy are all significant and have significant effects to each other as they are observed to have direct and indirect relationships. As the result of the study, it is found out that there are 6 direct relationships and there are 4 indirect relationships exist between latent variables. Awareness on Environmental Current Condition directly affects the Perception on Effects Environmental Pollution to Public Health and to Economy. Also, the Perceived Effects of Environmental Pollution to Public Health directly affects the Perceived Effect of Environmental Pollution to Economy and a strong direct effect to the Attitude towards Environmental Protection and Public Health is concluded. Also, Attitude towards Environmental Protection and Economy is strongly affected by the Perceived Effect of the Environmental Pollution to Economy. The results suggest that an increase on Attitude towards Environmental Protection and Public Health suggest a decrease on Attitude towards Environmental Protection and Economy. There is a mediated effect of Awareness to Environmental Pollution to Perceived Effects of Environmental Pollution to Economy; Attitude towards Environmental Protection and Public Health; and to Attitude towards Environmental Protection and Economic Cost. Also, there is indirect effect of Perceived Effect of Environmental Pollution to Public Health to Attitude towards Environmental Protection and Economic Costs. The results shows that the estimated ratio of the healthcare expenditure attributed to pollution to the Gross domestic Product (GDP) of the country is almost 0.8% to 0.9%. Hence, the estimated economic damage of the pollution to public health is significant and unambiguous.","jerico digno and venusmar quevedo industrial engineering department, college of engineering adamson university manila, philippines digno.jerico@gmail.com , venusmar.quevedo@adamson.edu.ph",
48,Vehicle Routing And Shipment Consolidation In A 3Pl Dc:  A Systematic Literature Review Of The Solution Approaches,"many of the manufacturing companies tend to outsource their logistic activities to third party logistics (3pl) providers due to numerous benefits they could obtain. since 3pl providers provide their distribution services for multiple clients at the same time, managing these activities properly with an optimized cost is challenging for them. so, they are much interested in minimizing the distribution cost which will ultimately benefit the 3pl provider, and thereby the client as well. shipment consolidation is one of the best and effective cost reduction strategies which could be followed by the 3pl firms, when distributing goods of multiple clients. vehicle routing problem (vrp) which is a well-discussed problem in the literature can be applied here since it is beneficial for the 3pl providers to find the optimal routes to distribute the goods from the central 3pl distribution center (dc), while consolidating shipments of multiple clients. therefore, this literature survey has been carried out to analyze the solution approaches, used in the literature related to vrp and shipment consolidation such that it would help in future research in developing a model to optimize the distribution in a 3pl dc by consolidating shipments of multiple clients. the results of the study have shown that most of the referred papers have used metaheuristic algorithms in solving their models and when the number of nodes are larger, it is suitable to use metaheuristic algorithms. therefore, it can be concluded that a metaheuristic algorithm would be appropriate when developing a model to optimize the distribution in a 3pl dc by consolidating shipments of multiple clients.","consolidation, march 7-11",,"h.d.w. weerakkody, a. wijayanayake and d.h.h. niwunhella department of industrial management, university of kelaniya, kelaniya, sri lanka. weerakko_im15043@stu.kln.ac.lk, anni@kln.ac.lk, hirunin@kln.ac.lk",

52,Ergonomics Study On Productivity Of  Middle-Aged Workers In The Shoe Industry,"majority of the local footwear manufacturers still impose the traditional or hand-made processes with low-level of technology. a correlational research design, using linear regression analysis, aimed to understand the relationship between health issues, work environment, and efficiency that can affect the productivity of middle-aged and older workers in the shoe industry. there are 139 respondents from 16 shoe manufacturing companies within marikina city participated in this study. rapid upper limb assessment and 10-point rating scale survey questionnaires, worker evaluation, and company evaluation checklists were used to gather data directly from the respondents and to assess their posture, tasks, and work environment. rula scores show that 53 out of 139 workers (38%) experience medium to very high msd risk. chi-square test of significance and correlation test results show that there are fourteen (14) statistically significant factors with moderate linear relationships that affect the productivity of the workers. safety measures, surface features, tool features, tool activities, illumination, and ventilation are the main categories that should be given utmost importance for improvement in every workplace. health issues and efficiency have a weak degree of relationship with productivity, but pareto charts and fishbone diagrams show the factors under these variables that need consideration.","ergonomics, linear regression","Health issues have a weak degree of relationship with productivity. Therefore, these health issues do not necessarily affect productivity. The relationship between the two variables might be weak based on the correlation test but health issues still have an impact with the productivity of a worker. Although it does not necessarily mean that the worker is less productive if the worker is sick or experiencing this health issue. Working environment has a moderate relationship with productivity. Therefore, the effects of adjusting the discomforts will necessarily have moderate impact with the productivity of the workers. However, it will have a significant effect not just on their productivity but also on their well-being in the long run. Efficiency and productivity also have weak relationships. However, Pareto chart reveals that falling objects, small scars and hammering of fingers are the three most common accidents that happen on a daily basis from mild to severe levels of pain. On the other side, physical stress, excessive pressure, high room temperature, mental stress, and excessive noise are the most frequent discomfort that may have been the reasons why efficiency decreases. Efficiency is the best possible output per unit of time. Therefore, doing the right things increases efficiency and productivity, and these two variables matter at the same level that will lead to true productivity (Stack, 2019). Bronchitis, coronary heart disease and diabetes are the three health issues that appear to be significant with productivity. Pareto charts however, suggest that joint pain, high blood pressure, and low blood pressure must be prioritized based on the 80/20 rule. This is because 51.3% suffer from joint pain, 25% have high blood pressure and 8.1% have low blood pressure. These percentage of respondents are suffering pain from mild to severe. Therefore, these are the significant factors that affect the productivity of workers. These common health issues may lead to absenteeism or delays while working. More than a handful of factors under working environment discomfort and improper practices that may lead to work related injuries appears to be significant with productivity. These significant factors under discomfort can lead to many consequences and domino effect not only with productivity but also in terms of health issues and efficiency. The biggest chunk of factors that are significant were all under the work environment. The chi-square test for p-value significance reveals that none of the factors under efficiency was significant. However, Pareto charts suggest that falling objects, small scars, and hammering of fingers need attention based on the 80/20 rule. Therefore, these factors are also considered as significant because these minor accidents frequently happen multiple times per day. Also, a follow up question reveals that 55.40% of the workers still make mistakes despite mastering their job. It also indicates that 55.40% of the respondents are not completely efficient while performing their task. There are several ways to improve the degree of relationship between productivity and the independent variables (health issues, work environment, and efficiency). Since the gathered data are opinion-based, retrospective data from companies, such as employees’ records of sick leaves/ vacation leaves, number of absences, number of accidents/cases, annual tool and equipment replacements, and turnovers, could help to improve the correlation between the average daily output of workers and the independent variables. The output per day also varies per job description that incurred a large variance since the workers declared these values like an open-ended statement. Thus, setting up a ranged-based question could improve the degree of relationships. Increasing the sample size in order to reduce the effect of a random error would improve the results of significance tests. However, factors that are insignificant but have at least a moderate linear relationship should also be considered. The relationship between the dependent and independent variables can be shown using linear regression analysis. This tool could also be used as a predictive model to compute for the output per day. The results drawn from the linear regression could help the employers to work closely with the workers in order to assess their welfare, especially their work environment. To better hear the workers’ insights about ergonomics and get their interest in workplace health and safety, the management for each company could incorporate a Participatory Ergonomics Approach, in which the workers would be involved in the conceptualizing, developing, and implementing of workplace designs and improvements. (Burgess-Limerick, 2018) Employers should also conduct training programs about ergonomics for their workers. Additionally, it is recommended that periodic auditing or workplace assessment should be conducted to maintain the appropriateness of tools, seats, surfaces, and optimal working conditions.

53,An Exploratory Analysis For Household Energy  Consumption And Conservation,"uninterrupted power supply is delivered to the most densely populated and economically important ""on-grid"" islands by two major electrical grids (irena, 2017b). as an archipelago of more than 7,000 islands, the philippines is a rapidly expanding nation (boquet, 2017). the remaining non-electrified lands ('missionary areas') are a significant number of remote islands without a power source or informal electricity supply. this research is intended to determine which among the predictor variables have effects on the energy consumption cost of filipino households. a survey design with random sampling was conducted in ncr and region iv-a to assess the quantifiable metrics and behavioral attributes of the dwellers. by offering two subsets, circumscribed and influenced, involving two variables each, the analysis can assess the sample more systematically as the estimated monthly electric bill was labeled as the dependent factor in the study. using pearson correlation and stepwise multiple regression, the significant factors that influence and disturb the energy consumption cost of filipino households were determined. moreover, the relationship among the predictor variables which plays a role on the study were also tested. this study, applies to household activities conventional electricity and does not involve other renewable energy sources such as solar, hydraulic, and wind.","energy consumption, filipino household","The study is to assess statistically which among the circumscribed and influenced variables have an effect on the energy consumption cost of Filipino households. A random survey was conducted in order to take note of the statistical measurements and behavioral attributes of household dwellers in NCR and Region IV-A. Through providing two subsets for each circumscribed and influenced variables, the research shall evaluate the study more accurately and precisely. The subsets for circumscribed are named (Subset A) demographics, and (Subset B) description of dwelling. For influenced, (Subset C) average monthly energy consumption, and (Subset D) attitudinal variables. The estimated monthly electric bill was labeled as the dependent factor in the study. Through executing Pearson Correlation and Stepwise Multiple Regression, the significant factors that influence and disturb the energy consumption cost of Filipino households were determined. Moreover, the relationship among the predictor variables which plays a role on the study were also tested. As a result of this study, the following factors have a significant relationship with the dependent variable (estimated electricity consumption cost) as their p-value are < 0.05: Subset A: estimated monthly income, family size, and education of family head; Subset B: floor area, and age of house; Subset C: no. of small appliances owned, frequency of usage of small appliances, no. of major appliances owned, frequency of usage of major appliances, no. of consumer electronics owned, and frequency of usage of consumer electronics; and Subset D: further knowledge on energy conservation, and individual efforts of every dweller. In conclusion, it is found that estimated monthly income, family size, and gender since birth of family head under Subset A; floor area under Subset B; no. of small appliances owned, no. of major appliances owned, and no. of consumer electronics owned under Subset C; and importance of individual efforts of every person living inside the house in order to attain lower electricity, and significance of energy conservation under Subset D have an effect on the fluctuation and changes in the cost of the energy consumption of households in the area of research. This clearly means that all of the listed factors below are responsible and could explain the changes in the energy consumption cost in Filipino household. It is one of the primary goals of this study to determine the percent of effect of the significant factor to the energy consumption cost of households. Overall, 25.7% of the adjusted variation in electricity consumption cost is explained by the demographics; 3.7% of the adjusted variation in electricity consumption cost is explained by the type of dwelling; 28% of the adjusted variation in electricity consumption cost is explained by the usage of appliances of the dweller; and 3.2% of the adjusted variation in electricity consumption cost is explained by the behavioral attributes of the dwellers.","paula mae g. reyes, dr. venusmar c. quevedo industrial engineering department adamson university manila, philippines 1000 reyespaulamae@yahoo.com, venusmar.quevedo@adamson.edu.ph",

55,Humanitarian Logistics Performance Improvement Model  Using Blockchain Approach,"disasters, both human-made and natural, have bleak characteristics to upheaval lives. disaster response requires multidimensional efforts and multidisciplinary teams. the humanitarian supply chain is responsible for managing the pre-disaster and post-disaster movement of goods, funds, information, and humans. this paper will explore managerial interventions possible in disaster response from a supply chain management perspective. paper will describe issues with information management of disaster relief operations. paper proposes a novel framework for integrating blockchain technology, internet of things (iot), social media analytics and advanced optimization algorithm to determine the relief action plan. the integration is sought to make the relief work self-regulated, encrypted, efficient, decentralized, responsive, agile and foolproof. the proposed framework may reduce the turnaround time of fund, improve resource distribution, and enhances reliability. the designed framework can also support the integration of blockchain platform with iot sensors, smart devices and autonomous equipment's. it will facilitate better interagency coordination, express decision making and wide adaptability or interoperability.","blockchain, framework","Paper presents a decision support system and information framework for relief work operations and disaster management. Several dimensions of proposed frameworks are discussed in the study. The paper is conceptual and only represents a brief overview of what can be developed as a foolproof system for easy and readily available data platform for HOs and HSC stakeholders. A key limitation of this study is that the constraints associated with the conceptual stage of the paper. Practical aspects of implementing such a framework can be presented after experimenting in the real-life scenario or after piloting with the proposed framework. A few pilot studies exist where HOs and donors adopted a blockchain-based information management system. However, coordination based on the blockchain does not exist. Thus, this paper may motivate future researchers to experiment with the coordination platform based on the blockchain system. Our future work will incorporate the laboratory trial of blockchain and IOT based HSC network. We will analyze the framework capability to draft the relief action plan and coordination capabilities.","anchal patil and vipulesh shardeo department of management studies indian institute of technology delhi hauz khas, delhi, india patil.anchal@gmail.com, vipuleshshardeo@gmail.com ashish dwivedi jindal global business school o. p. jindal global university sonepat, haryana, india ashish0852@gmail.com jitender madaan department of management studies indian institute of technology delhi hauz khas, delhi, india jmadaan@dms.iitd.ac.in",
56,Analysis Of Grey Model For Container Traffic Forecasting At  Indian Major Ports,"in the present era of globalization, the transportation system needs to be more flexible to meet customer demand. the port system has significant contributions to the fluent operations of the freight transportation system. with the increase in transport demand, the port faces multiple complexities such as lower utilization of resources, capacity issues, etc. the forecasting of container traffic at the port would help the port planning team and managers analyze the port system's infrastructural investment and optimization. in this study, the annual data of the past 20 years (1999-2019) of container traffic in teus at three indian major ports have been considered. the grey forecasting model and auto- regressive integrated moving average (arima) model is developed to analyze the container traffic data. further, the root mean square error (rmse) and mean absolute percentage error (mape) is used to test the model's accuracy. the results of the study show that both models are fit to forecast the container traffic data. precisely, the grey forecasting model fits better than arima for two ports tuticorin and cochin, with mape of 10.52% & 4.80%, respectively. the findings of this study would guide the practitioners and planning managers in decision-making related to port optimization.","arima, grey model","The forecasting of container traffic with improved accuracy is essential for efficient port operations and management. This study used and compared the two most widely used grey forecasting and ARIMA to forecast the container traffic at three Indian major ports. The container traffic data of the past 20 years of three Indian major ports, namely, Kolkata, Tuticorin and Cochin, is considered to conduct the study. The results show that the grey forecasting model outperforms the ARIMA model for the container data of Tuticorin and Cochin port with RMSE of 53.70 & 22.10 and MAPE of 10.51 & 4.80, respectively. The ARIMA (1,2,1) model for Kolkata port fits better than GM (1,1) with RMSE of 36.16 and MAPE of 5.24, respectively. However, both models are accurate better in terms of the MAPE table. Hence, it can be concluded that the grey forecasting model is efficient enough to forecast container traffic data at Indian major ports. The developed model would help port managers and planners to make decisions related to capacity and resource requirement, container schedules, etc. Also, the present study possesses some limitations too. The grey forecasting model is used for data of the last 20 years of container traffic (in TEUs) at three Indian major ports. The results may vary when more past data of more ports are included. Also, the rolling mechanism could be incorporated along with the grey forecasting model to increase the accuracy of the model. Also, some other forecasting methods could also be used along with the grey forecasting model to make a hybrid model. Such ideas could be taken as future research suggestions.

57,Fuel From Plastic Wastes For Sustainable  Energy Transition,"plastics are essentially made up from fossil fuels and can therefore be reverted to oil. pyrolysis involves the conversion of plastic wastes to fuel by thermally degrading long chain polymers into small complex molecules in the absence of oxygen. the objective of this study was to minimize plastic pollution and overdependence on fossil fuels by conversion of waste plastics to fuel. this study proposed a plastic oil pyrolysis plant as a solution to the challenges of plastic pollution and ever-growing demand for fossil fuels. the pyrolysis process is advantageous because presorting is not required, and the plastic waste can be directly fed and does not require pretreatment prior to the process. the plastics available for recycling currently used in the model is 15.83% of available quantity. the projected production is 29,826 liters per day. the preliminary evaluation showed that the pyrolysis economically viable project since the fuel obtained from the process is cheaper as compared to the convectional diesel as seen in the current market prices retails for about ksh80 (us$ 0.8). abstract: plastic recycling: waste to energy; plastic pyrolysis; pyrolysis oil. 1.0.introduction over 3000 million tons of plastics are produced globally accounting for about 8% of world oil production(oyake‐ ombis, 2012). with over one trillion plastic bags production annually, the plastic bags are the most important user or application of plastics globally(agency, 2018; al-salem, antelava, constantinou, manos, & dutta, 2019). the process of recovering and processing of waste plastics to useful products is called recycling. plastic recycling reduces dependence on landfill, conserve resources and protect the environment from plastic pollution and greenhouse gas emissions(al-salem et al., 2019; olalo, 2021). waste plastics can be processed to oil by thermal and catalytic conversion. this is a promising technology that will not only reduce plastic waste pollution, but also reduce the increasing dependence on fossil fuels for energy(kunwar, cheng, chandrashekaran, & sharma, 2016). urbanization has led to massive growth in plastic production globally. despite the many applications of plastics like packaging, plastics in the recent years they have become a nuisance especially towards the environment, human health, and aquatic life. in 2018, the plastic production was rated at 280,000 tons per annum and a small percentage of only 15.3% is being recycled while the rest ends up in landfills, drainages, and open spaces. there is need to increase the rates of recycling to reduce plastic wastes and other municipal solid wastes (kabeyi, 2020). the rapid growth in the production of plastics in the world has led to the pollution of the environment, aquatic life and brought about complications in human health. of the plastics produced, about 50% are disposable and can be reused, recycled or dumped (ru, 2010) and about 50% are used for disposable application. the impacts of plastic wastes in aquatic life include the increased presence of micro plastics which result in breakdown of larger plastic in aquatic ecosystems. they occur in form of spheres, pellets, and fragments. these plastics contain several hazardous chemicals such as thalates, poly-fluorinated chemicals, antimitroxide and brominated flame retardants (andrews, 2012). brominated flame polybrominated diphenyl ethers (pbdes) cause neurotoxic effects towards aquatic microorganisms. plastics to fuel is an alternative means of plastic waste disposal while still offering fuel for use(kunwar et al., 2016). the process used in plastic recycling is pyrolysis which involves degradation of polymeric materials to produce high quality fuel which can be used in diesel engines, boilers, and furnaces. polyvinylchloride (pvc) and polyethylene terephthalate (pet) are not used for this process since they produce high quantities of acid and low yields of fuel. the aim of this project is to convert plastic waste by heating them under controlled conditions to produce oil like industrial diesel and heavy fuel oil to be used in power plants, furnaces, and boilers. in nairobi, a city with a population of about 4 million people is only served by one major dumpsite, dandora dumpsite, which was commissioned in 1977(rivier, collignan, meot, madoumier, & sebastian, 2018). proceedings of the 11th annual international conference on industrial engineering and operations management singapore, march 7-11, 2021 © ieom society international 1023",,"There has been rapid growth of production of plastics in the world due to growing demand. They are mostly used as packaging of materials and containers Since they do not degrade, the best way to dispose them off is by recycling. Despite the ban on plastic bags, we still have a lot of plastic waste that should be handled and disposed. There are various ways of recycling of plastics, but pyrolysis promises to be an effective and cost-effective way of disposal. The pyrolysis plant has a capacity to produce 24,300 liters to 27,000 liters of oil from 30 tons of plastic waste. The plant has a yearly capacity of about 10950 tons. From the data of imports and exports of plastics it noted there has been a steady decline in exports across the years from 2014-2017. On the other hand, imports to the country have been increasing across the years due to the growing demand of plastics in the country even as exports have diminished over years. Blending the pyrolysis oil with alcohols has been proven to improve fuel properties in terms of acidity, corrosiveness, volatility, ignition temperature, heating value and energy density and this further reduces the environmental impact because of plastic oil pyrolysis. Alcohol content of up to 20% in diesel can be used in internal combustion engines (ICE) without any modifications. Methanol and ethanol due to their high latent heat of vaporization compared to diesel offer longer ignition delay period of combustion. Mixing of alcohol with pyrolytic oils helps improve undesirable qualities in terms of heating value, viscosity, and acidity. Solvent addition can prevent pyrolytic oil from aging effects. Implementation of the project will provide a solution to the challenge of plastic pollution in the country which is a has no such facility. It also provides economic benefits as calculated from the cost benefit calculations done whereby the Proceedings of the 11th Annual International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management Singapore, March 7-11, 2021","moses jeremiah barasa kabeyi 22064693@dut4life.ac.za industrial engineering department, durban university of technology, durban south africa oludolapo akanni olanrewaju oludolapoo@dut.ac.za industrial engineering department, durban university of technology, durban south africa","References

58,Dual Cycle Cogeneration Plant For An  Operating Diesel Powerplant,"in this study, a cogeneration plant is proposed for generation of extra electricity using a steam turbine running on steam produced from heat recovered from exhaust heat. an engine convers just 30 to 40% of energy in fuel to useful power with the rest being lost in the cooling and exhaust systems. this study demonstrates the potential of kipevu i diesel power plant to recover waste heat and utilize the same for electric generation. this will help to boost plant capacity making it a more reliable source of standby power. this is achieved through performance analysis of the plant to determine its availability and reliability as well as designing, sizing, and selecting the suitable interfaces for cogeneration system suitable for the plant. the key interfaces shall include the heat exchanger, the boiler (with feed pump, economizer, super heater, and preheater), the steam turbine and the turbogenerator. in the proposed development an exhaust gas boiler is used to generate steam using exhaust heat, the wet steam is superheated in a superheater heater at a mass flowrate f 2.8 kg/s and then used to run a steam turbine for extra power generation from a generator that is coupled to the steam turbine. key words: diesel power plants; cogeneration; combined cycle; rankine cycle; diesel engine; kipevu 1. 1.0. introduction internal combustion engines are widely used in transport, agriculture, and power generation as prime movers for both medium and heavy-duty machinery including electric generators in power plants. however, these engines convert less than 40% of fuel power to useful work with the rest being lost through the exhaust and cooling systems. through waste heat recovery technology, the low-grade heat in the cooling system can be recovered effectively with the organic rankine cycle(kabeyi & oludolapo, 2020d; wilson, singh, singh, & subramanian, 2017). generally, an internal combustion engine releases 30-40% of the fuel energy from combustion through the exhaust to the environment and an almost equal amount through the engine coolant (wilson john m. r., et al., 2017). this energy is just sufficient for recovery and for use in many thermal applications with minimal heat losses in the designed waste heat recovery system(barasa, 2018; kabeyi & oludolapo, 2020d; wilson et al., 2017). cogeneration is also known as combined heat and power (chp), and it can be defined as the simultaneous production of heat and power, utilizing a single primary fuel source. industrial power plants and heat engines in general, waste up to more than half its available energy in form of heat(oludolapo & kabeyi, 2020).with a suitable chp system, excess heat that would normally be wasted can be captured and converted into electricity. by converting this excess energy into useful power, we can achieve efficiencies as high as 89 % (clarke, 2011). this in turn means there is less fuel needed to run the plant engine, thus by making it so, then there is less pollution produced to the environment. while cogeneration has been used in power plants for a while now, we will discuss a provision of the same in the kipevu-1 power station combined heat and power (chp) systems in both power stations and large plants are becoming one of the most important tools for reducing energy requirements and consequently the overall carbon footprint of fundamental industrial activities(kabeyi & oludolapo, 2021). while power stations employ topping cycles where the heat rejected from the cycle is supplied to domestic and industrial consumers, the plants that produce surplus heat can utilize bottoming cycles to generate electrical power. proceedings of the 11th annual international conference on industrial engineering and operations management singapore, march 7-11, 2021 © ieom society international 1035",,"It has been identified that there is huge potential of energy savings using waste heat recovery technologies. Waste heat recovery defines capturing and reusing the waste heat from internal combustion engine for heating, generating mechanical or electrical work and refrigeration system. Waste engine heat can be recovered from the cooling and exhaust systems using the Rankine or organic Rankine cycles and used to generate extra power as well as process heat. If these technologies were adopted by the diesel powerplants, then it will be result in efficient engine performance and Low emission. The waste heat recovery from exhaust gas and conversion into mechanical power is possible with the help of the Rankine cycles.

59,Performance Analysis Of A Sugarcane Bagasse  Cogeneration Power Plant In Grid,"the overall objective of this study was to establish the feasibility of export-based cogeneration by a leading sugar factory in kenya. it was established that the sugar factory invested in a 34 mw cogeneration power plant to export 26 mw excess electricity to the national grid. reliance on bagasse alone as the fuel placed the plant at the mercy of the sugar factory operations and availability of cane. the study showed that after three years of profitable operation, the cogeneration power plant became unsustainable and export to the grid was stopped. the plant faced challenges like low load factor and capacity factors occasioned by unsustainable milling of cane. this meant irregular bagasse fuel supply to the power plant hence capacity underutilization and availability of the plant which attracted huge penalties from the utility company. the study recommends policy initiatives to encourage export of electricity from the sugar industry while development of multi-fuel plants will delink the co-generation from the challenges of sugar cane factory operation. these measures will improve the power plant availability, load factor, capacity factor and reliability ultimately making bagasse cogeneration suitable for base load grid electricity supply. key words: bagasse; sugarcane bagasse cogeneration; export cogeneration; challenges of bagasse cogeneration; electricity generation; combined heat and power. 1.0.introduction up to six million kenyans derive a livelihood from kenyan sugar and hence the need for proper and competitive management of sugar factories (jeremiah, 2018). kenya saves anywhere from sh40 billion to sh55 billion a year in import costs by using locally produced sugar – which matters more as our trade deficit continues to grow and place downwards pressure on the value of the shilling (kabeyi, 2020), yet to remedy the government has drawn up new regulations that appear unjustified. the common market for eastern and south african states (comesa)warned the kenyan government that there will be no further extensions in safeguards from imports by the trading block, yet kenyan sugar currently costs $870 a tonne to produce, compared with $350 a tonne in malawi and $400 a ton in egypt, countries which belong to the same trading block. comesa has warned there will be no further extensions in protecting domestic sugar from imports, yet kenyan sugar currently costs $870 a tonne to produce, compared with $350 a tonne in malawi and $400 a tonne in egypt (arum, 2019). the sugar cane industry has significant potential of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and other energy related pollution. according to naeem (2019), bagasse power plants reduce carbon emissions by replacing electricity produced from fossil fuels and avoiding disposal of unused bagasse which generates methane emissions on decomposition. in kenya just like many other countries, electricity is the most preferred form of energy according to the ministry of planning and development (mopnd) and the ministry of social council (mopnd, 2007). according to the energy regulation commission, erc (2011), only 1.5% of kenya’s electricity generation comes from the bagasse cogeneration even though the country has a potential of generating up to 195mw out of its bagasse production capacity. 1.1 background of mumias sugar company limited proceedings of the 11th annual international conference on industrial engineering and operations management singapore, march 7-11, 2021 © ieom society international 1048",,,"electricity generation moses jeremiah barasa kabeyi mkabeyi@uonbi.ac.ke industrial engineering department, durban university of technology, durban south africa oludolapo akanni olanrewaju oludolapoo@dut.ac.za industrial engineering department, durban university of technology, durban south africa","References

60,An Integrated Approach For Performance Evaluation Of  Healthcare Industry With Proposed Leagile Policy,"- during the pandemic outbreak, the healthcare sector is at the forefront to face the unforeseen crisis with its’ different wings including doctors, nursing staff, clinical and diagnostic services with diversified applications of medical electronics. healthcare services are characterized by the changing demand for products and services due to the changing dimensions of the pandemic day by day. hence the varying demand for healthcare services in these pandemic times should be monitored by a suitably structured framework so that the right product and service should reach the patient at right time and place. the objective of the present study is to analyze the performance of indian healthcare by identifying the healthcare performance indictors by means of bsc perspectives, which are responsible to improve the quality of health care service, ranking of healthcare units based on those key factors to validate the same, zone wise analysis for child healthcare performance, which leads to constitute a suitable strategy to improve nationwide child health care and propose a healthcare strategy framework to obtain the balance between patient demand and supply. the proposed leagile strategy with patient order decoupling point (podp) leads to a balanced leagile framework to meet the patient demand variations.","balanced score card, fuzzy topsis, podp",", Limitation and Future Scope On growing complexity in patient demand to avail the opportunities and new avenues in modern healthcare services, increased interdependencies in healthcare service delivery and unpredictable variation in patient demand leads to more complicated demand-supply structure in healthcare services. Moreover, the pandemic era accelerate the complexity further when healthcare service providers are implementing a suitable strategy to ensure adequate infection resistant measures for the patients. Technology has revolutionized the delivery of healthcare models by improving the quality of service being offered to the patients by reducing various cost components and turnaround time of workflow. In the present two-fold analysis, an effort has been made to find out the most important key factors for ultimate patient satisfaction and value-added patient service. The study also helped to determine the best performing districts in a state for child healthcare, one of the most important factor to move forward the national health indicator. The study can be explored further with Fuzzy DEA methodology with the objective to overcome the inadequate robustness of DEA Efficiency Frontier and the probabilistic feasibility of the DEA inequality constraints. The Leagile Strategy may be validated with suitable data through the Fuzzy DEA approach. The study can also be explored further with more input and output variables of Child Health Care Data with Fuzzy DEA approach to obtain more precise results.

61,Performance Analysis And Modification Of  A Slaughterhouse Waste Biogas Plant For,"in this study, the performance of an operating biogas plant using slaughterhouse waste was carried with the view of improving its operation and hence protect the environment from pollution coming from slaughterhouse waste. this research was conducted through site visits, observations, oral interviews, and document reviews. it was established that the existing biogas plant was not performing as expected. the study showed that the biogas plant performance is about 72.9% of the optimum production and uses only 5% of the available waste thus 95% is not processed leading to environmental pollution and waste of potential energy resource. it was observed that the substrate to water mixing ratio used 1:2.5, temperature in the digester averaged 34°c, average ph of the substrate was 6.5 and the pressure was 400mm of water. these parameters were regarded as outside the optimum production range. modification on the plant was therefore proposed based on the analysis done. the proposed new biogas plant design is expected to increase slaughterhouse waste utilization, increase biogas production, and reduce environmental pollution. the new biogas plant design has a 1600m3 digester with an expected output of 1920m3 and slaughterhouse waste utilization of will increase to 92.86%. key words: slaughterhouse; slaughterhouse waste; biogas production, biogas from slaughterhouse waste. authors biographies moses jeremiah barasa kabeyi is currently pursuing his d.eng. in industrial engineering in the department of industrial engineering at durban university of technology. he earned his b.eng. degree in production engineering and msc in mechanical and production engineering (energy) from moi university, in kenya, ma in project planning and management from university of nairobi, in kenya and diplomas in project management, business management and ngo management respectively from the kenya institute of management. he has worked in various factories including sugar manufacturing at nzoia sugar company ltd, pulp and paper at pan african paper mills ea ltd, and power generation at the kenya electricity generating company (kengen) in kenya, in an industrial career of 16 years before moving into teaching. he has taught in various universities in kenya including university of nairobi, technical university of mombasa, and egerton university and currently on study leave. his research interests are power generation, fuels and combustion, internal combustion engines and project management and sustainability. he is registered with the engineers board of kenya (ebk) and institution of engineers of kenya (iek) and has published several journal papers. oludolapo akanni olanrewaju is currently a senior lecturer and head of department of industrial engineering, durban university of technology, south africa. he earned his bsc in electrical electronics engineering and msc in industrial engineering from the university of ibadan, nigeria and his doctorate in industrial engineering from the proceedings of the 11th annual international conference on industrial engineering and operations management singapore, march 7-11, 2021 © ieom society international 1074",,,"biogas and electricity generation moses jeremiah barasa kabeyi 22064693@dut4life.ac.za industrial engineering department, durban university of technology, durban south africa oludolapo akanni olanrewaju oludolapoo@dut.ac.za industrial engineering department, durban university of technology, durban south africa",
62,Model Development For Reduction Of Accidents In Traffic  Congested Major Roads,"road traffic accidents (rtas) is a crucial matter that needs to be resolved, for it is one of the prime causes of injuries and fatality. therefore, methods of reducing the severity of an accident is a fundamental concern to traffic authorities, and of the public in general. in metro manila, there were certain roads that are infamous for having high collision incidences, injuries and casualties. this study focused on the top three accident-prone roads with the highest recorded occurrences, specifically edsa, c-5 road, and commonwealth avenue. the researchers applied multinomial logistic regression to determine the significant factors linked to accident severity and to find the model that would be able to predict rtas along the three major roads. the factors which substantially influence the response variable, accident severity (fatal injury, non-fatal injury, and damage to property), were evaluated. the predictor variables were month, time, accident factor, collision type, weather condition, gender, and age. the data for these variables were collected from metro manila accident reporting and analysis system (mmaras) managed by the road safety unit (rsu), a subunit of metropolitan manila development authority (mmda) from the year 2014- 2019. the software used to analyze the data was ibm spss. first, the data for each variable were coded separately for each of the major roads. by using the multinomial logistic regression, every variable will be tested to find out the significant factors for each of them. accident severity will be placed in the dependent variable section. while the predictor variables (month, time, collision type, accident factor and weather condition) will be placed on the factor(s) section. after determining the significant factors the next step is finding the prediction probabilities, these predictor variables will now be placed now to the covariate(s) section. the particulars necessary for the model were pseudo r-square, step summary, model fitting information, information criteria and cell probabilities. the parameter estimates and likelihood ratio test with confidence interval of 95% is needed to know if the parameters are suitable for the model. the subpopulations were categorized according to covariate patterns defined by factors and co-variables. the estimated response probabilities, predicted category probability should be included in the saved variables, so as the covariance matrix. the software will generate the results fundamental to answer the research questions. the three (3) common variables for the three major roads that were linked to accident severity were: month, time and collision type. the month affects the accident severity, because there were specific months that rtas were apparently high.the time of day is also pointed out to have an effect on accident occurrence. the road condition for proceedings of the 11th annual international conference on industrial engineering and operations management singapore, march 7-11, 2021 © ieom society international 1076",,,"russel l. palubon russelpalubon44@gmail.com cezille joyze r. pineda cezillepineda@gmail.com venusmar c. quevedo venusmar.quevedo@adamson.edu.ph noime fernandez noime.fernandez@adamson.edu.ph department of industrial engineering adamson university manila, philippines",
63,A Combined Approach Of Analytic Hierarchy Process And  Decision-Making Trial And Evaluation Laboratory Methods,"this study aims to evaluate key success factors associated with the third-party logistics (3pl) service providers in sri lanka. this study used the systematic literature review and expert’s opinion to identify the key success factors of third-party logistics industry in sri lanka. in total, 20 key success factors were obtained, and those key success factors were grouped into four categories as organization strategy, management and process, human resources and customer orientation. the study used the q-sort technique to group key success factors into four categories and analytic hierarchy process (ahp) to identify the priorities of the key success factors. decision making trial and evaluation laboratory (dematel) method used to identify the interrelationships among the key success factors in each category. the result shows that business expansion, technology and automation, internationalization of operations, management and leadership style are the most important key success factors in the sri lankan third-party logistics industry. the outcomes of this study can help managers/practitioners to formulate flexible decision strategies for better performance in their third-party logistics firms and experience a competitive advantage against the competitors.","key success factors, 3pl, 2010)","This study set out to investigate the importance and the interrelationships of the key success factors of 3PL industry in Sri Lanka. The study was able to investigate 20 key success factors using AHP and DEMATEL method. AHP does not consider the indirect effects for each criterion and assumes that criteria are independent. Therefore, the importance of key success factors calculated by AHP can be viewed as short-term improvement opportunity. In the other hand results of the DEMATEL application can use to make long-term improvement opportunities. These results would help managers in 3PL industry to develop strategies for effective supply chain management. The result shows that business expansion, technology and automation, internationalization of operations, management and leadership style are the most important key success factors in the Sri Lankan 3PL industry. These factors explain that most of the Sri Lankan 3PL service providers are currently in the growth stage of the 3PL industry and these key success factors will lead them to reach the maturity level. Therefore, managers need to focus more on these factors to increase the performance of the 3PL companies. Also, it is important to focus on key success factors which are in the organization strategy because organization strategy shows more relationships with other main criteria. That will be useful for the management to develop long term strategies for the companies. The model proposed in this work has its own limitations. For example, this AHP model is highly dependent on the judgements of the experts. Great care was taken in finalizing the key success factors but still there could be some errors due to human biasness or judgment. Though a generalized model is developed here in this research, a particular company in 3PL industry could select the criteria and sub criteria according to their requirements and interest and develop a model that is applicable to their interest. The results of the AHP and DEMATEL could be changed according the new key success factors come in to the 3PL industry. In this study only considered the key success factors from the 3PL service providers perspective but in future studies it is better to consider both 3PL service providers and their client’s opinion.","for evaluating key success factors of third-party logistics service providers theruwanda perera, annista wijayanayake and ruwan wickramarachchi department of industrial management university of kelaniya, sri lanka pereradg_im15025@stu.kln.ac.lk , anni@kln.ac.lk , ruwan@kln.ac.lk",
64,Evolution Of Energy Culture In Energy Behavior Research  In Buildings,"energy efficiency enhancement research on buildings has identified the necessity to focus on energy behaviour without limiting to the technical domain. in the energy behaviour research, energy culture has been identified as a comprehensive approach to examine energy efficiency in buildings which can subsume the important elements of the energy behaviour including technology and economics. the energy culture research approach driven by the empirical energy cultures framework is relatively novel. research on the status of application of the energy culture framework is rare relating to buildings. therefore, this literature review aims to examine the evolution of the energy culture research with a special focus on buildings and energy cultures framework to examine the status of the current application. the literature review occupied a systematic review based on web of science (wos) database. the results of the systematic review demonstrated an incremental trend in energy culture research in recent years in terms of the number of articles and citations. usage of the framework evidenced in several contexts. however, a considerable amount of further research opportunities has been identified in different contexts of energy culture including households, organisations, industries, communities, and countries.","buildings, energy behaviour, energy culture","Energy culture is an evolving research domain in the energy behaviour research. This review aimed to find the evolution of the energy culture research. According to the findings, energy culture research could be identified in several other research areas outside energy research on buildings. Energy culture related research has started to gain the popularity in buildings in the recent past according to the systematic review results. Further, utilisation of the Energy Cultures Framework in the energy behaviour research relating to buildings also has been increasing over the time which evidence based on the increased number of articles published and the increase of the citation in the area. Considering the current scope of the published research, it can be identified a representation of limited areas under household, industrial, community and countries categories. Further, the framework has been utilised in several key areas relating to buildings such as energy efficiency enhancement, a platform for interdisciplinary research, policy and regulation development, achievement of energy behavioural change, enablers of the energy behaviour change, identification of levels of energy cultures, platform to study energy transitions, an energy behaviour assessment tool and a tool to compare the actual and predicted energy consumption. However, there is a considerable amount of potential further research opportunities. The nature of the energy culture is sensitive to the heterogeneous nature of the different energy cultures such as households, organisations, industries, communities and countries. Therefore, the research findings of a particular context might not be generalised to another context and this invites specific research in different contextual backgrounds such as different countries, communities, organisations, and households. Overall, as the Energy Cultures Framework is relatively novel and still the applications have been evolving. lack of research in the area was evidenced due to this novelty. However, since the framework has been identified as a comprehensive platform to carry out energy behaviour research, expansion in future research is potential in a wider range.","dumindu soorige and gayani karunasena school of architecture and built environment deakin university geelong 3220, vic, australia dsoorige@deakin.edu.au, gayani.karunasena@deakin.edu.au udayangani kulatunga and lalith de silva department of building economics university of moratuwa katubedda, moratuwa, sri lanka ukulatunga@uom.lk, lalithds@uom.lk muhammad nateque mahmood school of architecture and built environment deakin university geelong 3220, vic, australia n.mahmood@deakin.edu.au",
65,Effective Supplier Selection Using Anp,"a supplier provides monetary benefits as well as non-monetary benefits for the organization, especially to maintain company reputation and customer satisfaction. therefore, an effective supplier network is an important key success factor of the organization. there are many common drawbacks in the existing supplier selection processes which hinder the selection of effective supplier/suppliers. therefore, the objective of this research is to develop a model and a mechanism to overcome these common drawbacks while predicting the validity of the model across a few industries. with the scope of this paper, supplier selection was considered as a multi-criteria decision making problem (mcdm) because supplier selection is the evaluation of trade-offs between multiple criteria. analytic network process (anp) which is a technique to solve mcdm problems in which the criteria affect each other and have nonlinear correlation, is used here to prioritize criteria and alternatives. therefore, this model is flexible for selecting suppliers for any product/service across any organization, sector, and industry. the significance of the proposed model is its flexibility across any industry with limitations and supports multiple criteria with any number of alternatives.",with globalization,"As an effective supplier pool is a key success factor of an organization that can highly contribute to gain competitive advantage, the supplier selection process should be systematically considered. For this reason, supplier selection is evaluated by researchers for many years in a large framework consisting of various techniques from the experimental to the analytical ones, and its successful applications were performed in numerous sectors. The main intention of this study was to propose a systematic procedure along with a general supplier selection model that is capable of addressing existing problems in the current supplier selection process like the subjectivity of decisions, difficulty in quantifying qualitative criteria. The proposed model is tested and validated through a case in a chemical manufacturing company. In this paper, supplier selection was considered as a multi-criteria decision problem and a model is proposed by using ANP. Therefore, this model is flexible for selecting suppliers for any product/service across any organization, sector, and industry. The significance of the proposed model is its Flexibility across any industry with limitations and supports multiple criteria with any number of alternatives. But this model will be more appropriate for large-scale manufacturing companies who are mainly focusing on exports, procuring products than services, procuring products use as the raw materials in the manufacturing process. Also, a general model with the same set of prioritized criteria cannot be applied across all industries. Also, industry-wise prioritizations not exactly similar but can relate to the general model with a few modifications and assumptions. Also, the data gathered from experts’ opinions show that this model also can be used in post supplier evaluation processes of the same organizations. Though there are many researches carried out using ANP for supplier selection, all of those are restricted to particular company, industry or a certain demographic area. But this research suggests a general mechanism that can be used for any supplier selection process of an organization in despite of the size, profit orientation or type of the organization (manufacturing or service).","h.i.udakanjalee, a.n. wijayanayake and d.h.h. niwunhella, department of industrial management, university of kelaniya, udakanja_im15041@stu.kln.ac.lk , anni@kln.ac.lk, hirunin@kln.ac.lk",

67,Job Shop Scheduling Using Shifting Bottleneck Heuristic  Algorithm,"production scheduling is defined as allocating limited resources to do several jobs. pt. hari mukti teknik is a company engaged in manufacturing and engineering in indonesia. the company implements an fcfs scheduling system with make to order and job shop production system. in order to produce a schedule that is efficient and feasible for the production process in the company, it is necessary to carry out further research on the production scheduling process using the heuristic method. the proposed method is shifting bottleneck heuristic algorithm. this method can determine which machines are experiencing bottlenecks so that the scheduling results in better job sequences and produces a smaller makespan. the current method results in the makespan of 603 hours, while the shifting bottleneck heuristic algorithm has smaller makespan, that is 468.71 hours. the proposed method produces better results than the company's existing method, where ei is 1.287 and re is -28.651% based on the performance evaluation with ei and re parameters. therefore, the shifting bottleneck heuristic algorithm is a better method and can be applied by the company to minimize the makespan.","scheduling, fcfs, job shop","Based on the study above, it can be concluded that the Shifting Bottleneck Heuristic algorithm method is a method that produces the shortest makespan, it is 28122.05 minutes (468.71 hours). With the proposed scheduling method, PT. Hari Mukti Teknik can save 134.29 hours of production time or around 17 days (16,785 days). This is because in job 6 and job 5 there is a relatively long processing time, the job is done first, as explained in the predetermined sequence. Refer to the makespan and the performance measurements such as EI and RE; thus, the Shifting Bottleneck Heuristic algorithm is promising to be applied by the company since it can save the total completion time and results in smaller makespan than the existing scheduling.

68,Implementation Of Maintenance Management In  Educational Institutions In Indonesia,"the purpose of the paper is to present the implementation of maintenance management in educational institutions in indonesia. it is important for every school to have an effective facilities maintenance management plan. therefore, we analyze how facilities maintenance is planned and managed by educational institutions (primary, secondary, and vocational schools) in indonesia. the survey questionnaires were sent to 37 schools through google form. the result shows that within some maintenance success indicators such as maintenance planning and policy; data collection and management; facility condition; human resource management; maintenance funding and cost; continuous improvement, most of the schools (97,3%) are already implementing maintenance programs. however, some of the schools (46%) never conduct training to improve the skills and competencies of human resources related to maintenance.","facility, infrastructure, schools","Based on this study, most of the schools are already implementing maintenance management program. Mostly school administrators and facilities/maintenance/custodial representatives are involved with long-range planning and short- range planning. About half of the schools surveyed updated the long-range plan every year and only few that do not update their long-range plans. Most of the schools have short-range plan that spans between six months to two years. In the aspect of how the schools assess the infrastructure condition, there are three mainstream methods that schools use almost equally. Visual inspection, which is the easiest and the most conventional of the three are slightly above the others with 35% of respondents. A more modern approaches which utilize technology are by using hand tools/sensors and maintenance software are probably done by a more modern school. In terms of budget for infrastructure maintenance, almost all schools already have budgeted their maintenance activities and all schools are committed to continue conducting maintenance activity for their facilities and infrastructures. However, it seems that the financial benefit of continuous maintenance in reduce cost is still unclear or difficult to measure by schools. It is indicated by the fact that only 40.6% of respondents who stated that the continuous maintenance results in cost savings. We can also deduct that the budget is not allocated to improve competencies of the technicians. Looking at the data about the training intensity for technical staffs, almost all of the schools only conduct maintenance training once a year or even not done at all.","hafizha marianto putri; kiki rizki yunita; lalita padmapuspita; nathania astria department of industrial engineering universitas indonesia depok 16436, indonesia hafizha.marianto@ui.ac.id, kiki.rizki91@ui.ac.id, lalita.padmapuspita@ui.ac.id, nathania.astria@ui.ac.id",

71,Modeling Electricity Tariff Scheme For Gas Engine Power  Plant By Considering Operation Risks,"this research discusses the determination of the electricity tariff scheme with a certain value limit on the capacity expansion plan of the gas engine power plant (gepp). the additional gepp will use some of the existing gepp resources such as land, gas supply network, electricity network, and human resources. a financial model with the incremental analysis method is designed to calculate levelized electricity rates, which is divided into 4 cost components, namely: investment costs (a), fixed operating and maintenance costs (b), fuel costs (c), and variable operating and maintenance costs. (d). monte carlo simulation is used to conduct a risk assessment due to the uncertainty of inflation, heat rate and availability factors. the results of the analysis shows that to achieve the electricity production target, it can be done through a combination of using other brands of machines, selecting gas suppliers, recalculating gas transportation costs, and reducing maintenance costs by performing a long-term maintenance contract (ltmc). this study considers most of the parameters that influence the determination of the tariff scheme, so that it can be used for other generator tariff scheme determination models. the result of the research on determining the tariff scheme for gepp indicates that a tariff adjustment needs to be applied, because it has considered the uncertainty over changes in the inflation rate and the exchange rate.",electricity tariff,"We developed a procedure and financial model to determine the electricity tariff for gas engine power plant in the context of operation risk uncertainty. Our results suggest using other machine brands, selecting gas suppliers, recalculating gas transportation costs, and reducing maintenance costs by performing LTMC to achieve the electricity target. Moreover, we show that shifting the component cost C has a significant effect on electricity tariff. From the three electricity tariff schemes that we conduct, the second scheme is the lowest electricity tariff among the others.","nurhadi siswanto, firda nur rizkiani, stefanus eko wiratno department of industrial and systems engineering institut teknologi sepuluh nopember surabaya 60111, indonesia siswanto@ie.its.ac.id, firda15@mhs.ie.its.ac.id, stefanus.wiratno@ie.its.ac.id",

73,Measuring The Performance Of Office Buildings  Maintenance Management In Indonesia,"maintenance planning contributes positively in effective maintenance activity. a quantitative method was adopted with the selection of 30 offices as the case studies. in total, 53 questionnaires were distributed to the end-users of the buildings. this paper proposes a performance measurement system that is proved to be practical and suitable to measure the effectiveness of maintenance service delivery of office buildings. this research concluded the priority performance of end-users in office building maintenance is diverse, and therefore there needs to be a clear benchmark and a development for performance measurement system from a strategic approach to identify the key aspects of performance to enhance maintenance service delivery.","office building, capital","Scrutiny of the conformity of the service element criteria shows that the majority of the maintenance managers did not emphasize several criteria pertaining to responsiveness and reliability service characteristics. As for building services, excellent implementation of cleaning, access, safety and security systems were accomplished. However, little emphasis was given by maintenance managers on criteria of several service elements such as landscaping, lighting, parking and mechanical maintenance. Building image on the other hand showed a high conformity by all maintenance managers particularly on internal image service criteria. This study has given an overview of the scenario of maintenance management in office buildings in Indonesia, particularly on the development of maintenance management systems and also performance measurement systems. The findings suggest that in general the common maintenance management systems applied for office building comprises of two major aspects namely technical and image with functional as service quality has little influence. This work has shown that benchmarking or assessment on the performance of maintenance management is very important as it enables the maintenance managers to comprehend the strengths, weaknesses and also significance of the service provided and also both tangible and intangible values of the building. Indirectly, maintenance managers can identify any probable threats or risks of their services. Concurrently, the establishment of maintenance management performance levels is beneficial for the maintenance managers to implement immediate actions to improve the performance. It also serves as a signal that a major transformation is highly required to enhance the quality of performance. The positive relationship also ascertains that the implementation standard of maintenance management systems determines the performance of maintenance management systems. At the same time, the difference shown in the priorities of maintenance management service elements signify that a strong emphasis on users’ needs and requirements is required from maintenance managers. This paper concludes that maintenance management guidelines and benchmark should be established in Indonesia to standardize the practices of office building maintenance managers. In relation to this, a statutory act on the compliance of maintenance management system criteria and regulations should be established to improve the maintenance management performance.","s. maulana b., afriandi g., tb. muhammad k.h., daniel f. industrial engineering department universitas indonesia salemba, dki-jakarta, indonesia sri.maulana@ui.ac.id, afriandi.ginting@ui.ac.id, tb.muhammad@ui.ac.id, daniel.febrianto@ui.ac.id",

77,Ai-Based Human-Robot Cooperation For Flexible Multivariant Manufacturing,"the flexibilization and intelligent design of multi-variant production systems plays a major role in mass customization. one major difficulty in such manufacturing systems is often the rapid retooling of production lines and workstations in order to respond as flexibly as possible to changing customer requirements and variants. in most cases, this also includes reprogramming of machines and robots, which have to be adapted to new work sequences. however, such a reprogramming overhead can be effectively reduced by endowing the workstation with the ability to autonomously understand the dynamic changes on the assembly sequence. the goal of the present work is to present a concept to automate such a reconfiguring process based on machine learning models and artificial intelligence. the proposed paradigm aims to highlight the role of the human-robot cooperation on the effective achievement of flexible multi- variant manufacturing in shared collaborative workspaces. in particular, the underlying problems of scene understanding, tasks modelling and robot autonomy are deconstructed and discussed. in other words, the autonomous reconfiguration is defined in terms of the process awareness of the collaborative robot through the monitoring, identification and prediction of the environment and operator states in terms of previous, current and predicted assembly steps. modelling the manufacturing process allows to abstract the spatiotemporal relations between the assembly steps of each variant’s sequence, independent of the operator actually executing the task. as a result, a flexible multi-variant assembly is obtained by the dynamic and intelligent adaptation of the collaborative robot integrated in the assembly workstation. the concept is partially implemented through an experimental setup of a collaborative assembly station in a learning factory lab.","industry 4.0, machine learning",,"manuel a. ruiz garcia, erwin rauch and damiana salvalai industrial engineering and automation (iea) free university of bozen-bolzano 39100 bolzano, italy manuelalejandro.ruizgarcia@unibz.it, erwin.rauch@unibz.it, damiana.salvalai@unibz.it dominik t. matt fraunhofer italia research 39100 bolzano, italy dominik.matt@fraunhofer.it","References

Then it described an integrated engineering education alignment model towards Industry 4.0 vision. Through a case study, it discussed the applications of this model on how a series of synergized engineering education activities can be defined and planned to leverage industry standard, i.e. SIRI. The involved engineering education activities include applied research projects, students’ capstone and FYP projects, and CET programs. Through this model, both faculty and students are exposed to opportunities to address the practical technological challenges of Industry 4.0. It also enhanced the strategic partnership between university and industry partners. By and large, this integrated alignment model could help to align the engineering education to be more industry-oriented and support the Industry 4.0 vision. The success of the case study depends on many factors, such as the applied research topics, the support from industry partners, the involvement of faculty and students, etc. The use of Industry 4.0 standard SIRI for technology road-mapping is more suitable at the corporate level. It is ideal for the alignment to be dialogued at the university level with industry partners. The future works include firstly the further enhancement of the curriculums with more relevance with Industry 4.0 vision, especially new proposed programs with a greater breadth and more interdisciplinary and cross-domain knowledge. Secondly, the greater coverage of CET programs on Industry 4.0 topics, which are in surging demand to upskilling the existing workforce with Industry 4.0 knowledge. Thirdly, the further strengthening of the strategic relationship between academics and industries. After all, ROI is the fundamental concern for companies to collaborate with universities on applied research, it is important to plan in phases for companies obtaining the business benefits along the journey.","w. d. lin and m. y. h. low singapore institute of technology, singapore (david.lin@singaporetech.edu.sg)",

81,Figure 1: Top Seven Cancer Incidence And Death Rate Worldwide [10].  Mathematical Modeling And Analysis The Effect Of Smoking,"lung cancer or bronchogenic carcinomas is the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. since smoking is the main cause of lung cancer, so we are focusing on the relation between smoking and lung cancer through mathematical modeling. in this paper, a mathematical model of lung cancer has been developed in terms of non- linear ordinary differential equation. the dynamics of lung cancer has been described by seirs model of five compartments as susceptible population, exposed population (subdivided into two compartments as smokers and victim of smoking), infected with lung cancer and recovered from lung cancer. we have analyzed the boundedness and positivity of the solution of the model. we have also calculated the basic reproduction number and have analyzed the stability of the smoke free and endemic equilibrium point of the model end up with numerical simulations. the specialty of our model is, it not only describes the lung cancer probability for smokers but also for the population who are victim of smoking. the analytical as well as numerical simulation of our seirs model have described the complete dynamics of the fatal diseases which will help us to minimize the fatality.","lung cancer, smokers, victim of smoking, nonlinear odes, seirs model","Lung cancer is a major cause of illness and death worldwide. It affects millions of patients all over the world. Lung cancer occurs throughout the world irrespective of age, sex, region and race. In this paper we observed the dynamics of lung cancer for the changing values of different parameters whether the effectiveness of lung cancer increases or decreases. We observed from the numerical simulations that the increasing number of active smoker results in larger number of victim population group and also increasing number of lung cancer affected patient. This clearly indicated that the fatality of this life taking disease can be minimized by controlling the number of active smokers and at the same time making the victim group safe from the smokers. Again the fatality can also be reduced by improving the recovery rate. This can only be possible when the disease is identified at a lower stage because as the cancer reached to a higher stage, it becomes more complicated and hard to recover and survive. Public awareness thus become the most important factor in this regard. Awareness among the people about smoking is the most important things. Then awareness about lung cancer is also important. If the disease can be identified earlier then the recovery possibility is maximum. It is expected that the proposed model can be of help for the clinicians and experimentalists who are associated with the research of lung cancer. It may be helpful for the health researchers to make plans and take decision regarding the prevention and/or cure of the lung cancer. It may also help to identify the causes of lung cancer and control them accordingly and thus can contribute to the public health worldwide.","for the dynamics of lung cancer jobayer ahmed and md. haider ali biswas mathematics discipline science, engineering and technology school khulna university, khulna-9208, bangladesh jobayerahmed629@gmail.com, mhabiswas@yahoo.com",

85,Analysis Of Temperature And Humidity In Cold  Transport Services,"the carriage of fresh food products is very sensitive to conditions during the transport, which makes the refrigerated transport of food products one of the most challenging transport activities. the aim of this project is to analyze factors that affect the product’s quality and storage life and demonstrate the influence of the right conditions during the operation. four devices installed permanently in three trailers were used for analysis. the sensors have enabled the data collection of temperature, humidity, and lux during transportation. tvsm tool was used to diagnose. data analysis was performed with the purpose to analyze the research question about how well the company handles its operating conditions of temperature and humidity during transportation. in this research, we found that temperature conditions were not satisfactory compared with the standard recommended conditions, like the official agreement of carriage perishable products (atp). a similar situation occurred with humidity. this research will be useful for those who are interested in the quality of the fruits and vegetables during transportation and companies of the same industry that wants to know the impact of the right parameters in their trucks.","food quality, temperature, humidity","The cold chain is one of the most difficult topics in logistics because it is related directly to the quality and if the products are not in ideal conditions, it affects directly the health of their consumer. In this research, there are a lot of opportunities to continue to develop these issues. The company under study showed that the most important factors that affect the senescence of the fresh products: temperature, humidity, and light, are not under control, and they directly affect the shelf life and cause an excessive weight loss (0.25%/day extra). From the sample, the temperature compliance with its own standards occurs less than 25% of the time. Besides, a reconsideration of the company standards must be done, since they do not agree with any of the literature or official standard, even there are several international standards and most of them did not match. The relative humidity is related directly to weight loss and shelf life. If the relative humidity is low, the transpiration rate will increase because the Vapor Pressure Deficit will grow, and consequently, weight loss increases.","alejandro lerma-carrillo, jenny díaz-ramírez university of monterrey engineering department san pedro garza garcía, n.l, méxico alejandro.lerma@udem.edu, jenny.diaz@udem.edu teresa gajewska cracow university of technology rail vehicles and transport department krakow, poland teresa.gajewska@pk.edu.pl",
86,Smart School Routing Problem For The New Normality,"the smart mobility plan in monterrey’s metropolitan area seeks to generate mobility strategies for the city that are sustainable and make dynamic use of data (with the support of icts). this initiative aims to improve the mobility in the region's universities and their surrounding zones as pilot tests and then scale them to larger city districts or to other schools around the world. as part of the university mobility plans, universities such as universidad de monterrey (udem), offers dedicated transportation services to its community (i.e. students and employees). however, recent studies show a low utilization of this service. this problem gets worse by the drastic social behavior changes caused by the covid19 pandemic and the decreased service capacity in response to the healthy distance constraints, on the eve of back to school under the new normality. the methodology followed in this work is intervention scientific research, according to its classic classification, implementing the hypothetic-deductive method. this project uses udem university as a case study to develop a comprehensive mobility proposal for school routes within the new normality’s operational conditions, such as potential demand increase, capacity decrease, demand patterns change, and real-time demand information.","smart mobility, university routing","In this work, the reduced capacity problem of the COVID19 pandemic has been tackled, with focus on school transportation. It has been demonstrated that improving efficiency of the system is possible in this environment, where demand will be greatly reduced because of the confinement regulations. A real-life case study has been analyzed and several solutions have been proposed. After identifying potential zones to increase the coverage of the service, the selected area was studied to allocate its demand to the identified potential stops. Then a routing and scheduling exercise was done to obtain the optimal route as well as start and end time for every available schedule, maximizing coverage while minimizing total travel time. The dynamic phase was then carried out where a great improvement to the service app was recommended as well as a proposal to optimize the van’s travel time during each trip drastically. The results state an improvement in coverage, total travel time and better usage of the capacity, as well as the best solution methods depending on the size and complexity of the case to be solved. Further investigation can be performed to further detail how the changes in size and complexity of the problem can impact the performance of the studied methods.

88,Improvement In The Performance Of Computer Numeric  Controlled (Cnc) Router By Oee For Digital Pattern,"the overall equipment effectiveness is an indicator of the improvement of the process. this paper focuses on overall equipment effectiveness. this paper aims to improve the digital patterns' production by extending the computer numeric controlled (cnc) router capability. it would help to capture the day-to-day fluctuations in the manufacturing process and performance of the cnc router. in this research, the cnc router's performance was analyzed, and the root cause was identified as it was the bottleneck of the process. for data analysis, checklists were designed which identified the value-added and non-value-added activities that resulted in underutilization of the ""availability."" after studying the current scenario, it was justified that the cnc router was underutilized, so the focus was to optimize the utilization of the router's availability. there were six significant problems identified from the checklist: machine breakdown, low air pressure, management loss, unavailability of the operator, unavailability of the tool, and heat up due to high feed. after identifying the significant problems, pareto analysis was conducted to check each problem's impact on utilizing the ""availability"" of the cnc router. the pareto analysis results indicated that 49% of the total loss time was due to the machine breakdown, whereas 11% of total loss time was due to low air pressure. these two problems were significant and targeted for improvement. after selecting the significant problems, a cause-and-effect diagram was used to identify the reasons for these losses. it was observed from the cause-and-effect diagram that the machine breakdown's possible causes were maintenance problems, flawed method or delay in lubrication, and poor mechanism of the dust collector. for process optimization, preventive maintenance was adopted to reduce the maintenance's impact on the machine breakdown. a checklist was maintained, which helped to improve the utilization of ""availability"" by 10%. a dust collector was installed to make the machine tidy, which improved the utilization of ""availability"" by 4%. as a result, the percentage of “availability” increased to 90% from 61%.",,,"manufacturing abdul hannan, shazray khan, sana hassan institute of quality & technology management university of the punjab canal bank road, lahore, pakistan a.hannan.iqtm@pu.edu.pk shazray.iqtm@gmail.com sana.iqtm@pu.edu.pk",

90,Valuation Of Pt Adaro Energy Tbk By Forecasting Of  Indonesian Coal Index Using Geometric Brownian Motion,"the coal price index movement, mostly the indonesian coal index 3 (ici 3), varies from $37.6/ton to $74.9 per ton from jan 2012 to dec 2019. this volatility drives uncertainty in the future of coal mining companies. recently, the house of representative indonesia has legalized law 3 year 2020, enabling the first generation holder of coal contract of works (ccow) or perjanjian kerja pengusahaan pertambangan batubara (pkp2b) to extend their contract until 2 x 10 years in the form of special business mining license/ ijin usaha pertambangan khusus (iupk). law 3 year 2020 also impacts financial performance since the fiscal policy change in value-added tax, royalty, and corporate tax tends to raise the government’s earnings. law no 3 year 2020 gives an additional 10% portion of earnings after-tax implemented as well. this study aims to access the possibility of the indonesian coal index (ici3) movement in the next five years using geometric brownian motion and compare the difference between before and after implementation of law 3 year 2020. the authors have simulated one thousand scenarios of five years’ movements with the random normal distribution. the result shows that the enterprise value of adro is reduced by 12.4% from $5,680 million to $4,976 million. this result implies that adro should anticipate enterprise value reduction by efficiency program or strategic business expansion.","adro, brownian, coal, ici3",,"and fiscal impact of indonesian law 3 year 2020 idam faisal rahman and yunieta anny nainggolan school of business and management institut teknologi bandung bandung, west java, indonesia idam.faisal@sbm-itb.ac.id, yunieta@sbm-itb.ac.id",
91,Comparing Different Concrete Construction Techniques:  Modular Versus Individual Panel System Methods,"buildings account for a substantial portion of environmental burdens. this study assesses modular concrete prefabricated prefinished volumetric (ppvc) with concrete individual panel system (ips) concrete construction method. this mode of construction is still nascent in many countries. therefore, the environmental and economic impacts of ppvc concrete must be determined and compared to ips concrete. the results show that material production is the most significant phase, as it contributes to 60% of total global warming potential (gwp) and 70% of the total cost. furthermore, the results indicate that ppvc is associated with a 5% decrease in gwp emissions when compared to ips; further, the cost of ips for a single-family house is 1.3% higher than that of ppvc. the leading factor that influences the cost of ppvc is the design process, which is 2.5 times more expensive than ips design. however, the assessment of multi- story buildings shows the opposite result. this regard shows that ppvc is 1% cheaper and 3% more environmentally friendly than ips. therefore, ppvc might be a more sustainable construction method than ips.","concrete building, life cycle cost","In this research, two types of PPVC and prefabricated concrete were assessed and discussed towards having better knowledge and capability to implement both. However, there is a lack of studies to identify the optimum structural system for estimating the GWP emissions and costs involved in implementing both methods. PPVC modules are manufactured off-site complete with internal wall/floor/ceiling finishes, fixtures, and fittings, and transported on- site for installation. PPVC is sometimes referred to as volumetric construction of prefabricated buildings, although strictly speaking, a prefabricated building need not be PPVC. Nevertheless, IPS is completed on-site. Currently, there is a lack of appropriate assessment approaches to capture the differences between PPVC and IPS. Both systems have implications that make them valuable alternatives to traditional construction, but the question of how to determine which one to choose or which one is more suitable for a specific project still prevails. This paper proposes a framework to aid decision-makers in choosing between the construction methods by integrating the aspects of environment and cost. The preliminary result shows that the IPS system requires many on-site activities, which lead to higher emissions. Such occurrence can be reduced significantly by adopting the PPVC system within the whole project. Nevertheless, hoisting the PPVC system is a big challenge that must be carefully considered during the design phase.","ali tighnavard balasbaneh1, mohd zamri ramli2, mohammad hossein taghizadeh valdi3 1faculty of civil and environmental engineering, universiti tun hussein onn malaysia, 86400 parit raja, johor, malaysia, tel: +60136743818, tighnavard@uthm.edu.my 2institute of noise and vibration, school of civil engineering, faculty of engineering, universiti teknologi malaysia, 81310 johor, bahru, johor, malaysia 3department of civil engineering, isfahan (khorasgan) branch, islamic azad university, isfahan, iran",
92,Estimating The Reading Time Of   Familiar And Non-Familiar Words,"reading time is worth estimate in many contexts of engineering design such as the directional sign presented on narrow space, the design of technology interface in car for user to read while driving, or process simulation of people evacuate from any disaster that need to read some word sign. while the majority of researches in this area have been focusing on the development of reading skills, where traditional study were relied on reading speed to apply on word reading time. thus, the purpose of this study was to estimate the reading time of familiar and non-familiar words concerning individual differences in term of iq level. a total of 59 thai natives participated in this study. results provided reading time estimating equations and pattern of reading time. implications for designers are discussed.","familiar word, non-familiar word, reading speed, normal reading","This study aimed to estimate the reading time of familiar and non-familiar words concerning individual differences in term of IQ level. Results provided the estimate reading time equations that showed more accurate results to the time obtained from the experiment than using traditional reading speed. The results revealed that people reading time have an effect from both medium, such as word familiarity and number of syllables of word, as well as an individual differences in term of IQ level. The results from reading speed test showed contradictory to the literatures that IQ have effect on people reading speed (Whitaker & Stacey, 1981). This might be explained that the article used to assess reading speed in this study are general topic article, while IQ showed effect on reading word test that participants from high IQ group took shorter time in reading word than those from low IQ group.

94,Application Of Multiple Criteria Decision-Making Methods  In The Human Resource Recruitment Process,"recruitment process pledges sourcing of valuable assets to exemplify boundless contribution to a company. the existing gap within inconsistent employee performance of the it company relies under appropriateness of applicants to the position, company culture, and clients. thus, the study aims to develop the recruitment process through multiple criteria decision-making methods, namely multilevel analytic hierarchy process (ahp) and technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (topsis). the framework consists of three levels separated by 1st level sub-criteria of grammar skills and comprehension skills, 2nd level sub-criteria of experience, overall impression, spoken english, profile presentation, pre-written skills, education, and visual presentation, and 3rd level sub-criteria of written communication skills and analytical reasoning skills. sequence of aforementioned sub-criteria in each level were arranged from highest to lowest weight percentage whereas multilevel ahp and topsis produced the same order but with different sub-criteria values. rank proximity between the two methods produced an average of at least 82.41% closeness. consequently, multilevel ahp was more applicable in three level recruitment sub-criteria identification whereas topsis was more appropriate for the entire framework of recruitment process. the recommended strategies systematically increase efficiency of recruitment process and credibility of applicants.",recruitment process,"Human resources strategic plan of the IT company comprises rigorous recruitment process. Currently, the IT company’s recruitment process encompassed three levels: (1) English proficiency examination; (2) video interview; and (3) text interview and advanced problem solving test. In characterizing a system to generate the most qualified applicant, multilevel AHP and TOPSIS were used. Three executives with direct responsibilities in the recruitment process were asked to complete AHP and TOPSIS questionnaires. Computed sub-criteria weights were different in both MCDM methods but were similar on executives’ ranking perception. The average ranking proximity values between AHP and TOPSIS were 96.30% for the 1st level, 93.38% for the 2nd level, and 82.41% for the 3rd level. Values are relatively high and at least 82.41% adjacent to 100% accuracy. Furthermore, multilevel AHP and TOPSIS were compared to the established parameters. It was highly recommended to use multilevel AHP in evaluating criteria and sub-criteria in three different levels to determine the top-performing applicant in each level. Consistency of weights was performed to discern credibility of results. On the other hand, TOPSIS achieved better result in prompt identification of criteria and sub-criteria for the entire recruitment and was more appropriate in a single level approach. The best applicant was identified through wide-range recruitment process incorporated with MCDM methods. The existing methods were further developed through a multilevel framework incorporated with 2nd level of sub- criteria. Consequently, it is expected to produce extensive results if 2nd level sub-criteria were evaluated. Moreover, predictive model was generated to assess significant demographic factors relative to the most qualified applicants. In 1st level, male applicants with social sciences or arts degree from NCR college have higher chances to proceed to the next level. Female applicants with ages of 26-37 years have higher chances in the 2nd level. Lastly, female applicants who came from private school and with ages ≤ 26 years have higher chances to be hired by the IT company. As a result, overview of credible and quality applicants was produced. The recommended recruitment policies clearly showed outline of system development through scientific and rational MCDM methods.","maela madel l. cahigas, rex aurelius c. robielos, and ma. janice j. gumasing school of industrial engineering and engineering management mapúa university, manila, philippines maelacahigas@gmail.com, racrobielos@mapua.edu.ph, mjjgumasing@mapua.edu,ph",
95,Disassembly Sequence For Hydraulic Pump Using  Disassembly Geometry Contacting Graph In Augmented,"this paper presents a study based on design for disassembly (dfd) applied to a hydraulic pump through the disassembly geometry contacting graph (dgcg) methodology. dfd is today very important to reduce the disposal or maintenance costs foreseeable already in the planning phase. one of the key points in reducing costs is reducing time for disassemble each component. because of that, the disassembly time was considered respect to other fundamental and optimizable characteristics such as: disassembly costs, operations to be performed, quantity of material, etc. all the operations have been evaluated using the time measurement units (tmus). the objective of the paper is to minimize the disassembly times required for an operator to separate each single component from the other. the study of accessibility, positioning, strength, and basic time led to a comparison between different disassembly methods in order to produce the optimal sequence. in the end, the validation of the sequence was carried out in an augmented reality (ar) environment in order to predict the manual disassembly understanding the possible issues without the need of building the components. using ar, it was possible to look at the assembly during the design phase in a 1:1 scale and evaluate the chosen sequence.","disassembly, virtual reality, cad, sequence","This paper proposed a comparison between two disassembly sequence, the first one is based on virtual experience and the second one is scientifically supported by a defined algorithm. The hypothesis made at the beginning resulted in few fractions of difference between the two method. This is due to the fact that the assembly has a particular arrangement of the pieces for which disassembly is constrained to be carried out in a specific order. All constraints are cylindrical coaxial with cylindrical contact surface. However, the equality of the two-sequence underlines that for simple cases it is not necessaire to use complex matrices or algorithms to perform the right disassembly sequence and that virtual/augmented reality should be more considered in the disassembly process and design phase to discover and underline simpler general principles that can be used for operator’s training.","reality environment gian maria santi, alfredo liverani, giampiero donnici, edoardo croati, leonardo frizziero department of industrial engineering alma mater studiorum university of bologna viale risorgimento, 2 – 40136, bologna, italy gianmaria.santi2@unibo.it, leonardo.frizziero@unibo.it, giampiero.donnici@unibo.it, alfredo.liverani@unibo.it",

104,Virtual E-Learning Community Hub –   For Higher Education In The Raw Materials Sector,"the “virtual e-learning community hub - for higher education in the raw materials sector” caters to a central element of the european pillar of social rights, namely to enable high-quality education for all people, and is also in agreement with unsd goal 4. in today's transformation society, digitalisation is fast progressing and digital tools recurrently flood the market. a significant number of these tools have been developed for higher education purposes and were widely used during the covid-19 period. digital literacy has increasingly become one of the most important skills in the majority of the world and those who are unable to keep up with the rapid transition into the digital era face the risk of reduced employment opportunities or social exclusion. the hub aims at providing basic training and information to hei teachers and students to bridge the gap into the digital world, as well as, to serve with an adapted methodological-didactical framework to encourage auto-didactical learning at a high level, with an emphasis on the raw materials sector. this virtual hub will help to shift traditional educational paradigms and prepare today the t-shaped engineers needed for tomorrow. the realisation of the vech is part of a successful research project.","digitalisation, higher education","A significant influence due to the strategic-geographical orientation of the consortium includes the geographical dimensions of Europe and beyond. The close cooperation and the networks on local, regional and (inter)national level of the participating organisations allow a horizontal dissemination of the results and above all, the incorporation of the virtual hub into the research work. The use and implementation of the virtual hub will also considerably facilitate the supra-regional transfer of knowledge. The overriding (international) goal beyond regions and geographical borders is professional training through the implementation of skills and competence required in the future, in order to be able to react already now to the changing conditions on the world market and thus to train the engineers of tomorrow. Ergo, the second action of the European Commission ""Strengthening skills intelligence"" (European Commission 2020) is supported. In addition, this action will also be followed up by making digital competencies visible, as certification will ensure international comparability and validity. These proven skills can then be entered autonomously into the personal CV or Europass by the graduates of the MOOCs on the virtual platform. • Additional influence at regional level: An essential innovation factor of the project at the local or regional level is the synergistic effect on knowledge transfer, since all partner universities have a similar academic structure and are active in regional areas with great diversity. This knowledge transfer manifests itself, for example, through a significant positive impact on the different networks of universities, UBC, teaching and learning methods, courses or on the students and the academic staff themselves. • Additional influence at national level: All partner universities are in close contact with national institutions such as ministries, associations or federations and are often involved in national projects with interdisciplinary partners. By using the virtual hub within these consortia, further proactive dissemination can take place, thus informally increasing the level of awareness of the project and the project results considerably. This factor contributes considerably to the action ""EU support for strategic national upskilling action"" (European Commission 2020) initiated by the European Commission. Especially in today’s globalised world the topic of digital education in HEI´s can no longer be detached from the idea of teaching students in a classroom, as a blended/hybrid or fully online format. It opens up a whole new world of comprehension and methodological flexibility. This is the reason for this pan-European consortium under the lead of MUL to take initiative and enhance teaching standards in Europe to a digital and much needed level, together as competent and complementing partners. Only through the integration of digital concepts into teaching lasting solutions for the industry can be created. The consortium is home to in-depth knowledge of content and design of engineering education, the necessary technical expertise regarding digitalization in education as well as experience in connecting the technology with pedagogy and the competence to market the finalised product. It can thus provide the required expertise to create a new digital top-notch education system for Europe for the benefit of the RM sector.","corina pacher; mariaelena murphy; resources innovation center montanuniversitaet leoben franz josef-strasse 18, 8700 leoben, austria corina.pacher@unileoben.ac.at; mariaelena.murphy@unileoben.ac.at; erwin rauch faculty of science and technology free university of bolzano universitätsplatz 1, 39100 bolzano, italy erwin.rauch@unibz.it katerina adam; george valakas; konstantinos modis school of mining and metallurgical engineering national technical university of athens heroon polytechniou 9 zographou campus, 15780 athina, greece katadam@metal.ntua.gr; george.valakas@gmail.com; kmodis@mail.ntua.gr robert pierer managing partner and co-founder qoncept dx gmbh peter-tunner-straße 19, 8700 leoben, austria robert.pierer@qoncept.at",

106,Technological Aspects Of Green Manufacturing’S Adoption  By Smes: The Role Of Owners,"this study examines the role of the owners’ green knowledge of technological aspects (relative advantage, compatibility, and complexity) and green manufacturing’s adoption by small and medium-sized enterprise(s) (sme(s)) producing batik textiles in indonesia. six hypotheses are tested using partial least squares (pls), based on the survey approach. we obtained the data from 131 owners of smes and used this to analyze the hypotheses. a direct relationship is tested for between three technological aspects and green manufacturing’s adoption. a moderating relationship is examined between the technological aspects, green manufacturing’s adoption, and the owners' green knowledge. the results suggest that relative advantage and complexity have no significant influence on green manufacturing’s adoption. however, relative advantage shows a significant effect when moderated by the green knowledge of the owners of the smes. compatibility has a direct and significant effect, and it gets stronger when it is moderated by the owner's green knowledge. meanwhile, complexity does not show a significant effect on either relationship.","green manufacturing, sme, green knowledge","of the Hypotheses Dependent Variable GMA R2 = 25.3% Independent Variables RA 0.13* ComPt 0.301*** ComPx 0.027 Not supported Know Know*RA -0.38*** Know*ComPt 0.265*** Know*ComPx 0.021 Not supported * p < 0.1; **p < 0.05; ***p < 0.001 This study finds that relative advantage is a predictor of GM’s adoption, so (H1) is supported (p < 0.10). The hypothesis of compatibility being a predictor of GM’s adoption (H2) is also supported. The hypothesis of complexity as a predictor of GM’s adoption (H3) is not statistically significant (p > 0.1) and this hypothesis (H3) is not supported. The moderating aspect on H4 and H5 is supported, while on H6 it is not supported. 5.3 Discussions The findings of this research reinforce the position of relative advantage, as a construct that influences the adoption of innovation and GM, according to the previous research (Alshamaila et al., 2013; Ramdani et al., 2013a). The results of this study show that the owner's green knowledge strengthens the effect of relative advantage on GM’s adoption by SMEs. In this research, complexity does not have a significant effect on green manufacturing’s adoption. The moderating effect of the owner's green knowledge, which is expected to strengthen GM’s adoption, is not supported either. This finding is parallel with Premkumar and Roberts’ research (Premkumar & Roberts, 1999). Hypothesis H3 is not supported, indicating that SMEs have the perception that green manufacturing is easy to adopt. This finding is in line with the previous research, which stated that GM’s practices are easy (Kendall et al., 2001). The owner, who is usually the top manager, has the important role of moderating the technology factor’s drivers for the adoption of GM (Gandhi, Thanki, & Thakkar, 2018). They face responsibilities for various problems, including environmental issues. Sometimes they don't have enough time to deal with these problems. Therefore, it requires prioritization and good knowledge so that the role of the managers can strengthen GM’s adoption by SMEs.

The results delivered a significant managerial impact to the operators for their daily operational works. It opened a window to control one part of heat, ventilation, and air- conditioning (HVAC) system’s various parts as the outcome leads the operators to identify the factors effecting AT in a typical room located at a standard commercial building as well as to determine the levels of that factors. The proposed framework can be used to investigate more factors and levels employing higher-order factorial designs.

109,Green Supplier Selection Using Fuzzy Approach Of Ahp  And Vikor – A Case Study In An Indonesian,"pharmaceutical industry in indonesia has grown significantly due to the covid-19 pandemic. the industry is now becoming one of the country’s priority sectors, with one of the key development practices is to achieve green industry standards. this study aims to design a green supplier selection model by incorporating the economic and green characteristics for active pharmaceutical ingredients (api) suppliers. analytic hierarchy process (ahp) method is used to weigh the criteria with a fuzzy approach and vikor method to rank the suppliers based on the weighted economic and green criteria. this research results in the ranking of 6 suppliers for 2 different apis. with the proposed model, pharmaceutical manufacturers can have a better understanding of the capabilities that a green supplier must possess for the purpose of selecting the most suitable green supplier.",,"Evaluating suppliers is an important part of implementing the green purchasing practice for a business. The selection of green suppliers in the Indonesian pharmaceutical industry is studied in this paper. The framework of a green supplier selection method for is presented. In order to assess the suppliers, 5 criteria and 19 subcriteria are chosen based on literature review and expert judgments. Applying the framework to an Indonesian pharmaceutical company's green suppliers, by using the fuzzy AHP method and the VIKOR method, the results are obtained for 6 API of Ascorbic Acid and Hydroxychloroquine suppliers. And it is found that the main influential criteria are Quality, followed by Price, Service, Management, and Environmental Performance. In addition, for Environmental criteria, the most fundamental subcriteria is Waste Management, followed by Environmental Certifications, Emission Control, Management Commitment, and Regulatory Compliance. The framework affects the selection of suppliers in the company. It is found that the most suitable green suppliers are those that have realized the green criteria to its full potential. In Indonesia, companies have gradually realized the importance of environmental protection. Yet, few companies still do not realize the importance of the practice. The alternatives that are similar to the positive-ideal solution were chosen as the best alternative, but far from the negative-ideal solution. Finally, it is found that alternative A3 (Ascorbic Acid) and H3 (Hydroxychloroquine) is the best selection and that alternative H2 (Hydroxychloroquine) can also be included in the company’s selection of green suppliers if the decision-making strategy were to be done by voting.

122,X-Bar Control Chart Patterns Identification Using Nelson’S  Run Rules,"different types of run rules are proposed and applied to the control charts to identify unnatural variations as early as possible. two opposite views are found in literature regarding pattern identification by run rules; one view in favour and the other view criticize the application of run rules for pattern identification. in this paper nelson’s run rules were investigated in detail for sensitivity and identification of control chart patterns. the goal is to gain deeper insights on the opposite views about the run rules. the rules were applied individually and in combinations to fully developed patterns. the results confirm that most of the run rules individually do not identify specific pattern. however, the run rules can be used to identify specific patterns when applied in appropriate combination. the results suggest that combinations of nelson’s run rules can lead to identification of shift, trend, cycle, and systematic control chart patterns.","control chart, run rules, process variations","This paper investigates the effectiveness of Nelson’s run rules for identification of different types of abnormal patterns on X-bar control chart. The Nelson’s run rules sensitivity and patterns recognition capability were evaluated individually and in combinations. Combinations of run rules are proposed for identification of specific unstable patterns. The shift and trend patterns cannot be explicitly differentiated using the Nelson’s runs rules combinations. since the same combination of runs rules were sensitive for both shift and trend patterns. The cyclic and systematic patterns can be effectively identified using the proposed run rules combinations. The stratification patterns are more sensitive to R7 individually rather than combination of run rules. There is a need for further investigation to explicitly differentiate between trend and shift patterns. Designing new run rules for small shift, trend and other patterns may be an interesting future research direction especially for application within short run production environment where data driven soft computing pattern recognition techniques may have limited effectiveness.

123,Inventory Management Framework To Drug Receiving  Project At A Local Drug Store,"a mental health problem in thailand tends to grow over the year. the increasing of psychiatric patients causes hospital congestion and complexity of medication accessing including suanprung hospital in chiang mai province. thus, the hospital has developed a new project to set a local drugstore as a dispensing for patients instead of the hospital. inventory control is the key to the success of this project. inventory cost is a significant factor of concern. the data of drug expenditure is collected from surveys and interviews of the pharmacists. then, abc-ved analysis is applied to the overview of the inventorying process. after that, a framework for inventory management is proposed. as a result, the analysis can help to categories the drug priority which required frequent monitoring, practical framework and inventory cost reduction are the expected results. future research to testing a result, the simulation process can provide the analysis and development of the logistics operation model in a project to reduce the workload of pharmacists in hospitals and develop an operating procedure in the project.","abc-ved matrix, drug inventory, health care","The objective of this study is to improve inventory management in the hospital, which has no technique for drug inventory control. while there are an increasing trend of patients and the new project to effect inventory management in the future, there is an increase of 47,171,456.89 to 52,033,378.72 in hospital expenditures in 2018- 2019 shown in Table 6. The study finding indicated that the ABC–VED analysis was a technique for identifying classify drugs, the resultant matrix in 2019 makes it possible to focus on manage according to Category I, II, and III. Category I there is the highest cost (80%) of expenditure requiring stringent control, these drugs must always be maintained in stock since they are either vital to patient. Category II 49 items required moderate control, the drugs are either essential to the patient. Category III there is required lower control. The drugs are not essential a therapeutic impact, which revealed that 95 items costing 2,372,549.66 baths of the expenditure. The hospitals can consider removing unnecessary drugs in Category III. It saving purchasing budget. The proposal to the hospital improve more efficacy inventory management. Which corresponds to the research (Mani et al. 2014) (Sabah et al. 2020) (Nigah et al. 2010) (Taddele et al. 2019). This analysis is hoped to promote effective management of drug inventory with minimal monetary while required to reduce stocks and order frequency, which there are order 729 times a year in 2019. Moreover, it also recommends calculating the forecasting technique for predicting the demand of drug items with economic order quantity (EOQ) and the re-order point (ROP). It can reduce the total cost of drug inventory in the medical store. (Keerthana et al. 2018) (Kanyakam 2018) This research discusses the framework to inventory part of the project that can confident reduce cost inventory. Future research, the results of this research are used in the calculation of part project costs. Another, aim of simulation technology to provide alternatives pharmacists to reduce the workload in hospitals caused by the increase in patients and create a project. The collected data of outpatient use the service. Then, the efficiency indicators which are the average total time, the average waiting time of patients, and the working time of pharmacists, are analyzed to create the new simulation systems. The proposal to the hospital better options for hospitals.

125,Fabrication Of Seed Oil-Based Flexible Polyurethane And  Identify Failures From The Processing Pathway,"the preparation of polyurethane (pu) foam using green-based polyol from soybean oil as an alternative for petroleum-based polyurethane. the polyurethane was fabricated by using the prepolymer method following the two steps namely epoxidation and alcoholysis reaction. the ftir, hydroxyl numbers were used to monitor the process of the synthesized polyol and determined the physicochemical properties. choosing a suitable method for the processing of polyurethane foam soy-based became a major to the success of the production. temperatures of operation, reactants, were not the only to be focuses dealing with organics the length of the reaction should also be considered. the research aimed to focus on the optimized fabrication of soy-polyol as intermediate to flexible foam polyurethane. identify the use of the length of reaction to epoxidation reaction, and hydroxylation, and evaluates the correlation to the physical property of the foam product.",fabrication,"The success of polyurethane production was determined apart from the materials used and the formula used, it determined by the processing include the length of the reaction. The chemical structure of polyols synthesized from renewable materials has a significant difference from polyols from petroleum materials. This of course will give an ultimate differentiation of mechanical properties.

126,Manufacturing Of Low Loading Application Of Phosphoric  Based Polyurethane From Edibles Epoxide Conversion,"polyurethane (pur) is a type of polymer produced for a wide range of applications. commonly polyurethane was made from synthetic materials. due to the decreasing availability of petroleum and the risen global attention has made scientists made a breakthrough in using vegetable oil. the double bonds of essential fatty acids embedded in plants are advantages to be modified to attain an epoxidation reaction. adding additives into the formula can improve the final properties of polyurethane, phosphate oligomer was used and prepared to be reacted to the active sites forming a network with intermediate’s active site manufactured a phosphoric-based polyurethane foam to be required for use in low loading applications. this work aimed to investigate the epoxide conversion of the unsaturated bonds to attain a reactive chain and determined the relationship of the oxirane number and hydroxyl value to proceed as a polyurethane’s intermediate. the temperature at 700c was the best according to cellular images but the density was best at 500c which was contrary to sem images.","epoxide conversion, reactivity, plant fatty acid","Polyurethane foam was prepared from soybean oil using o-H3PO4 in the polyol formula. It was found the incorporation of H3PO4 much contributed to the ultimate polyurethane foam. With the synergize between reactant and temperatures applied, it can be concluded the best density was obtained at temperature 500C. Nevertheless, temperature 700C was the best according to cellular images where the temperature has lowered to the formation of the small cavity. The increased heat potentially trapped CO2 in a small amount and gives smaller cellular formation. The fine cellular obtained in sequential temperature 700C > 600C > 500C. The product firmness indicated through density was best at 500C which were on contrary to cellular images.","flora elvistia firdaus*, donna imelda, lubena, rinette visca department of chemical engineering, jayabaya university jl pulomas selatan kav 23 jakarta-13210, indonesia flora_elvistia@yahoo.com deimelda18@gmail.com, lubena2013@gmail.com, viscairsyad96@gmail.com",
127,Influence Of Geographic Information System On Natural  Disaster Management In The United Arab Emirate,"the aim of this study is the examine the influence of geographic information system, on disaster management in the united arab emirates (uae). in light of the new nuclear development at braqa and other expansions in uae energy sectors, it is important to understand the vulnerabilities of the sector as a means of preparedness for a future natural disaster. therefore, a structured questionnaire with a 5-point likert scale was used as the instrument for data collection from the total of 329 respondents from the national emergency crisis and disasters management authority (ncema). the findings show that there is a significant positive influence between geographic information system and disaster management. this implies that geographic information system plays a crucial role in the disaster management effectiveness. this study will contribute the existing literature related to the factors effacing the effectiveness of the disaster management. also, future researcher might investigate further on the relationship between the other geospatial technologies and disaster management.",2018). however,"The objective of the study was set to investigate the influence of geographic information system on disaster management. To achieve the stated objective, questionnaire survey was used to seek the response of individual respondents on the extent of their perspective on contribution or the influence geographic information system on disaster management activities and effectiveness. Thus, the result of the analysis showed that there is a significant positive influence between geographic information system and disaster management. This implies that geographic information system plays a crucial role in the disaster management effectiveness. This outcome is in line to that of Tomaszewski (2020) who found geographic information system applications play a crucial role in mitigation of disasters. Similarly, Hasan (2013) pointed that the most factor or determents of the effectiveness of the disaster management is geographic information system. Also, the present study supported by the findings of Abdalla (2017) and Pirasteh & Li (2017) who mentioned that the applications of GIS in disaster Management are increasingly becoming an integral element of disaster and emergency management activities globally. According to Thomas (2018) geographic information system is a type of geo-technology in GIS technology, has extensive potential in disaster management; including damage assessment, risk prediction and situational analyses, vulnerability and resilience assessments, and prioritization of mitigation alternatives. Another study done by Brian Tomaszewski et al (2015) on Geographical Information Systems for Disaster Response and Management; Brian Tomaszewski et al (2015) concluded that GIS continue to gain important recognition from disaster practitioners and academic researchers during what is debatably the most publicly visible disaster management stage. Therefore, GIS to support situation awareness, the time sensitive nature of disaster response geographic information, and the need for common data sharing collaboration and coordination with various administrations and disciplines (Brian Tomaszewski et al., 2015). Yagoub (2015) also stated that GIS experience and social media usage were regarded as factors that could impact user evaluation of this information system. However, although geo-informatics technologies and earth observation satellites have already demonstrated a strong flexibility in providing data, analyzing data, and modeling for a broad range of applications (Pirasteh & Li, 2017). The geo-informatics for natural disaster management and Earth Observation Global Changes events have been struggling in establishing a platform for scientists, researchers, practitioners. Another study done by Abdulrahman (2014) on the GIS as a high performing computing tool for disaster management and control. Concluded that it is important to understand that while GIS can enhance the existing disaster management programmes, its integration requires broader management and institutional issues be addressed. Technological advances and extensions of geographic information systems have opened the way for several applications in disaster management. Thus, as the result from this study has confirmed that geographic information system pays an important role on the effectiveness of the disaster management, thus, it is highly recommended for the National Emergency Crisis and Disasters Management Authority (NCEMA) and other agencies involving in the disaster management might consider the contribution of the geographic information systems. 6.

In this study, VAIC has a partial and positive effect on ROE in real estate and property companies that are listed and active on the Indonesian Stock Exchange for the period 2018-2019. The increase in VAIC will have an effect on the increase in Firm Value which is in accordance with the existing theory. Company size, which in this study is measured by Ln Assets, has a partially negative effect on Firm Value in real estate and property companies. Therefore an increase in firm size will affect the decrease in Firm Value. Intellectual Capital and Company Size which in this study are proxied by the value of VAIC and Ln Assets have a simultaneous impact on the company value which is proxied into the ratio of ROE in real estate and property industries that are entered and are active and survive on the Indonesia Stock Exchange for the period 2018-2019. The measurement of the firm value variable in this study was ROE, the Intellectual Capital variable used VAIC and the firm size measurement used Ln Assets.","meiliani luckieta accounting department harapan bangsa business school bandung, west java 40132, indonesia meiliani@ithb.ac.id eriana astuty, iston dwija utama and ivan diryana sudirman entrepreneurship department binus business school undergraduate program, bina nusantara university, bandung campus bandung, indonesia 40181 eriana.astuty@binus.ac.id, iston.utama@binus.edu, ivan.sudirman@binus.edu",
129,"Gender, Student Background, And The Implications For The  Emergence Of Student Entrepreneurial Activities","this study aims to obtain empirical evidence regarding entrepreneurial activities carried out by students at several universities in indonesia, both public and private universities based on gender. this research involved various driving factors including entrepreneurship education before entering college, entrepreneurial experience before entering college, and student entrepreneurial orientation. the survey was conducted at 18 universities in indonesia by obtaining data from 456 respondents. the data analysis techniques were contingency testing to compare the relation students background and student entrepreneurial activity with gender as the control variable, and confirmatory factor analysis to analyze the tendency of entrepreneurial orientation of female students and male students. empirical evidence states that gender has an important role in the relationship between students' entrepreneurial experiences before entering college with the level of entrepreneurial activity carried out by students, while the entrepreneurial education they got before entering college does not have a significant relationship with student entrepreneurial activities. this proves that entrepreneurial learning which is only based on knowledge doesn’t have positive implications compared to direct entrepreneurial experience. the results of this study provide suggestions for decision-makers in universities that the provision of an eclectic entrepreneurial learning ecosystem will have more implications for student entrepreneurial activities.",gender,,"eriana astuty, okky rizkia yustian, and chyntia ika ratnapuri entrepreneurship department, binus business school undergraduate program, bina nusantara university, bandung campus, bandung, indonesia, 40181 eriana.astuty@binus.ac.id, okky.yustian@binus.ac.id, chyntia.ratnapuri@binus.ac.id","References

By integrating Kano model into e-SQual and e-RecsQual method is implicated to the importance level which means there is a different priority improvement. There are three main attributes that should become improvement focus because of having high importance level “The site provides a contact number if there are any problems when running the features on the site”, “The site can be launched and run right away”, and “The site offers to talk directly to customer care if the problems cannot be resolved or the information on the site is still unclear”. The Investment Coordinating Board as the OSS system provider need to use this information as the initial basis to conduct system improvement. Recommendation for the next research is collecting more respondents so it will represent the real needs of business trading license service users and the also technical responses are also needed from the service provider so that the decision-making process in service improvement can be carried out appropriately and considering the needs of service users.","kiki rizki yunita, m. dachyar, djoko sihono gabriel industrial engineering department universitas indonesia, indonesia kikiyunita87@gmail.com; mdachyar@yahoo.com; dsihono@yahoo.com",
132,System Dynamics Modelling Approach For Palm Oil Supply  Chain Under Various Policy Interventions: A Case Study In,"the development of indonesian palm oil industry in international trade does not ignore challenges such as competition with products from other exporting countries as well as trade barriers from importing countries. with the new delegated regulation by the european commission that considers palm oil does not meet the principle of sustainability in the concept of renewable energy, indonesian government is encouraged to increase the effectiveness of mandatory biodiesel implementation by adjusting regulation domestically. this situation affects the performance of oil private palm companies, which currently contribute ± 50% to the total land area and production of indonesian palm oil. this research aims to modelling the supply chain system of a large private company with system dynamics approach that can be simulated under government policies intervention related to the palm oil industry and supply chain performance. system dynamics simulation is used to draw causal relationship of the supply chain and to monitor government regulations on supply chain performance. the result of this research is a conceptual model for decision making that can support the company's supply chain performance under different policies.","palm oil, government policy, biodiesel","Supply chain has a significant role to ensure the improvement of efficiency and productivity to gain competitive strategy and customer satisfaction for a company. A good understanding in supply chain processes, will allow the company to formulate more appropriate strategies to achieve optimum results. This study proposes a supply chain model of palm oil company to help decision makers understand the behaviour and the process in the system. For this case, it relates to policy interventions like land moratorium and biodiesel mandatory. Based on the formulated model, we simulate the total area and the demand for each sector in which could help to forecast annual game-plan and volume budgeting or to make some internal policies, such as: replanting, adjustment of refinery capacity, etc.","indonesia’s private company nathania astria, m. dachyar, rahmat nurcahyo industrial engineering department universitas indonesia, indonesia nathaniaastria13@gmail.com; mdachyar@yahoo.com; rahmat@eng.ui.ac.id",

139,The Logilegolab: A Problem-Based Learning Approach  For Higher Education Institutions,"industry 4.0 concepts and technologies offer a multitude of possibilities for the systematic improvement of material and information flow processes in logistics systems. however, the usage of laboratories for the experimental testing and subsequent further development of industry 4.0 approaches in industrial logistics still can be considered as an underdeveloped subject area in higher education institutions. based on a problem-based learning approach, this paper investigates the recent literature on teaching and learning laboratories in the context of industry 4.0 to identify the potential areas of action for an industrial logistics laboratory in the fields of research, academic teaching, and industry-related applications. moreover, the authors develop a new concept for a module-based laboratory and derive implications for further research and industrial projects.","industry 4.0, smart logistics, logistics 4.0, laboratory, labs","In front of a techno-economics background (Zunk 2018), the paper presents a concept for the ‘LogiLegoLab’. Care was taken to ensure that all the previously discussed topics were considered in this laboratory. This has resulted in a laboratory that can be designed very flexibly. This concept also makes it possible to continuously integrate new modules with new technologies into the laboratory. Lego as a tool, which should represent the flow of goods in the laboratory, was also defined. Furthermore, possibilities were shown how aspects of research, academic teaching, and industry-related applications can be integrated into the laboratory in the future. It would be important that, in the future, more institutions should focus on the concepts and technologies of Industry 4.0. This could, with the help of intelligent technologies, solve many problems. To make progress in this area, it will also be important to work together on new solutions within a laboratory-based network. Research should be as open and free as possible. Nobody should feel threatened by another laboratory, but rather the possible collaborations should be strengthened in the future. This would be a big step forward in terms of understanding the advantages of Industry 4.0. Concerning this work, it would be desirable for the future if the implementation of a new laboratory would be successful. This requires motivated university personnel who, on the one hand, convince the curriculum commission to open towards new teaching and learning methods and integrate them into the current curricula. On the other hand, the industrial partners must also be convinced by profound research results to invest in this method. In addition to the financial aspect, the current problems and challenges of practice must also be methodologically and didactically professionally prepared to guarantee a suitable learning environment for the students (Woschank and Pacher 2020; Zunk and Sadei 2015).","jakob kompatscher chair of industrial logistics montanuniversitaet leoben franz josef-strasse 18, 8700 leoben, austria jakob.kompatscher@stud.unileoben.ac.at corina pacher resources innovation center montanuniversitaet leoben franz josef-strasse 18, 8700 leoben, austria corina.pacher@unileoben.ac.at manuel woschank chair of industrial logistics montanuniversitaet leoben franz josef-strasse 18, 8700 leoben, austria manuel.woschank@unileoben.ac.at",

143,Fuzzy Ahp Signifies Criteria Influencing Third Party  Logistics Selection In Outsourcing Decisions Of Freight,"outsourcing decisions for logistics activities are a multi-criteria problem, composed of qualitative and quantitative factors. most decision support models in logistics outsourcing or known as third party logistics (3pl) are popularly adopting the multi-criteria decision making (mcdm) methods used in manufacturing or import/export business. however, most factors in outsourcing are identified as human judgments which are challenging in term of objectively measuring. freight forwarding is one of major businesses that frequently utilizes 3pl. yet, few studies of outsourcing logistics for freight forwarding business were investigated. purpose of this study is to examine and propose critical criteria to be used in decisions to choose 3pl road transportation provider for freight forwarding companies in thailand. responses from experts in the industry was calculated using fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (fuzzy ahp) procedure to obtain weight and rank of criteria. the result reveals that top 3 criteria for freight forwarding company to use in evaluating road transportation provider are quality of service, cost of service, and delivery performance respectively.",criteria,"In general, 3PL evaluation has many criteria depend on objective, goals, and needs of each business. This paper illustrates data collecting and modeling procedure to discover level of importance of factors influencing third party logistics selection in outsourcing decisions. Expert in freight forwarding industry’s opinions were collected via carefully designed questionnaire to pairwise compare eight relevant factors. Responses were analyzed using Fuzzy AHP. The benefit of using fuzzy AHP is that it reflects human judgments using the AHP under the MCDM concept. The resulting weight shows that top three most important criteria for evaluating 3PL (road transportation) in freight forwarding industry are quality of service, cost of service, and delivery performance at 0.218, 0.215, and 0.205 BNP, respectively. All proposed weight criteria from the study could be used as important criteria in performance evaluation and supplier selection process for freight forwarding enterprise because they reflect requirements of the 3PL that lead to effective process and service. As a result, criteria from this paper can be adopted to the freight forwarding business to select road transportation 3PL provider. Practitioners could apply the result to their organizations or follow the procedure to fit their organizational goals.

145,Factors To Determine Quay Crane Lifecycle: Retrofit And  Replacement Policy,"container terminal is a specialized port facility for container vessels to load and unload shipping containers. yard cranes, terminal tractors and quay cranes are used to transport container between wharf and yard and vice-versa. quay cranes’ container handling speed is considered as the performance of container terminals commonly indicated as moves per hour (mph). as such, quay cranes with high reliability and availability is paramount to ensure desired container handling performance is achieved. however, in many container terminals the performance of quay cranes is impacted due to lack of maintenance, spare parts and timely refurbishment, retrofitting or replacement of deteriorating components or the quay cranes itself. this paper attempts to propose the appropriate maintenance activities to be carried out and the performance of the quay cranes are monitored to detect impending performance deterioration and action to be taken. the approach is based on evaluation of 12 months operational data of breakdown frequency, breakdown hours, operating hours, container moves and downtime. the correlation analysis for reliability has good negative correlation (-0.75) with breakdown frequency and breakdown hours has strong correlation (0.93) with breakdown frequency. the study will explore 60 months data to establish a quay crane reliability prediction model.","quay crane, retrofit, lifecycle, equipment","The 12 months data has identified the first step parameters for quay crane reliability prediction. The study is expected to explore further with 60 months or longer data in identifying more parameters to establish a quay crane reliability prediction model. As the quay crane is the most expensive piece of equipment in a container terminal and determines the overall performance of a container terminal, the operational reliability of the quay cranes is very critical. Breakdown of any one of the quay cranes assigned to a vessel will impact the performance of other quay cranes assigned to the vessel as well. As such the performance, reliability and lifecycle monitoring of the electrical control system and timely retrofit planning will have high contribution in overall quay crane lifecycle management. A retrofit predictive model can play a significant role in establishing the electrical control system replacement policy that can ensure the reliability of the equipment.","sundaraja perumal gothandapani, mohd nizam ab rahman department of mechanical engineering universiti kebangsaan malaysia ukm bangi 43600 selangor malaysia g.sundaraja@gmail.com, nizam@ukm.edu.my",

147,Determinant Of Factors Affecting Customer Satisfaction:  Case Of The Logistics Industry In Sri Lanka,"sri lanka is a key transshipment hub on the important east-west trade route. in terms of logistics performance, sri lanka ranked 94th out of 167 countries according to the world bank's logistics performance indicator (lpi) for 2018. if sri lanka is to exploit and leverage its positioning to its fullest potential, then it is imperative that the country must improve on its overall positioning in the index, by being competitive, improving on efficiency and being sensitive to customer needs. improving customer satisfaction is crucial for business sustainability, and importantly act as a deterrent to prevent customer switching. although previous research has captured the relationship between customer satisfaction and service quality through a combination of the servqual (service quality) or servperf (service performance) model, there are other controllable factors that can influence this relationship. the study examines from both a service as well as the performance perspectives and incorporates other controllable factors that influence customer satisfaction. the study is based on the third-party logistics (3pl) industry in sri lanka. it considered all the important influencing factors and their relationships with each other in a systematic review process and was supplemented by reviews from industry experts and data inputs from 3pl customers. it was found that customer handling, tech initiation, competitive prices, and flexibility, have a significance impact over the all the dependent variables (customer loyalty, switching behavior, customer complaints). the results could be used by the service providers, to realign their offerings to suit the demands of its customers and help the country become a logistics hub for the region.",,"The objective of the study was to propose a model for customer satisfaction, with the focus on the 3PL sector in Sri Lanka and to quantify the intensity of relationship among the identified independent variables customer satisfaction. The study has shown that all the independent factors (warehouse operations, transportation operations, customer handling, flexibility, tech initiation, competitive prices, organizational image) influence customer satisfaction. According to the three models which have been discussed in the study, Customer loyalty can be impacted by Flexibility and Tech initiation (Table 1). Coefficients (Table 7) proves that coefficients of each independent variables are less than 0.005. It implies that flexibility of the customer service and improvements of the technology engagement will lead to the customers to continue to full fill their business needs with the same service providers. Model 2 (Table 2) implies that Customer handling, Competitive prices and Tech initiation are most affective factors to the Switching behavior (Table 8). It shows that good customer management with attractive prices and technological advancement would intend customers to switch to other service providers. Complaint handling (Table 3) mostly can be affected by Flexibility and Tech initiation (Table 9). Being flexible to customer enquiries and customer focus services using technological advancement can be led to minimize the complaints from the customers. Considering overall impact of the Customer loyalty, switching behavior and Customer complaints as Customer satisfaction, this study implies that Customer satisfaction can be affected by Flexibility, Tech initiation, Customer handling and Competitive prices of the 3pl service providers. As discussed in section one, the appropriate selection of elements in the logistics performance index is important in addressing this aspect and unlocking and creating new value to the customer. This value should be understood as attracting and retaining loyal customers. The effectiveness and efficiency of logistics customer service activities depend on understanding the essential components of services and providing customers with such solutions to meet their needs. This proposed model enables 3PL service providers, to distinguish significant factors, which have a considerable effect on the customer satisfaction. Further, the outcomes would assist the 3PL providers to minimize customer switching behavior and switching costs, as they have a clear idea about the expectations of customers that Proceedings of the 11th Annual International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management Singapore, March 7-11, 2021","s. m. d. t. k. egodawela, a. n. wijayanayake*, and p.l.s. peter department of industrial management, faculty of science university of kelaniya sri lanka egodawel_im15009@stu.kln.ac.lk anni@kln.ac.lk* suren@kln.ac.lk","References

148,Exploring The Sentiment And Online Review Of Multilevel  Marketing (Mlm) Company Products,"reviews and tweets posted on social media and websites offer timely opinion and feedback for companies to learn about customers’ concerns. as a seller or marketer, it is important to understand what customer thinks and feel about products or services offered by the companies. this study aims to explore the sentiments of public opinion and understand the reason behind it through sentiment analysis and topic modelling approach. the first objective of this study is to analyse customer perceptions and sentiments towards multilevel marketing (mlm) company’s product. then, the second objective is to identify the primary topics of concern regarding the products shared on social media. to achieve these objectives, customer reviews were collected from multiple platforms such as social media namely twitter, online web review i.e., moutshut.com, trustpilot, sitejabber.com, and e-commerce websites such as amazon, lazada and shopee. other than that, a survey was also conducted to triangulate the data and to get first-hand feedback and review from the customers. in this study, the reviews were analysed using sentiment analysis and topic modelling techniques: valance aware dictionary and sentiment reasoner (vader), natural language toolkit (nltk) packages, latent dirichlet allocation (lda). the findings of the study revealed that over 50% of the reviews were positive and customers were mostly shared about the product quality such as the originality, delivery and product packaging in their reviews. this study offers some insight about public perceptions towards the products from mlm company and at the same time helps in improving the products and services globally and locally.","sentiment analysis, product review, topic modelling, social media","that can be derived is that the unethical selling from the e-commerce website like Lazada and Shopee should be stopped and bring forward as the negative reviews from that platform as seen in Figure 7 could taunt Amway’s business image. Figure 7 Sample of negative reviews 5.2 Factors of product review using topic modelling In this study, 10 topics were extracted using the LDA method. Figure 8 illustrates the 10 topics with 5 top keywords each. K is set up as 10 as it is enough value to describe topic classification based on the amount of data collected (Goswami & Kumar, 2016; Kim, Jeong, et al., 2016). Figure 8 Topic classification graph Based on the topic division, the first topic represents the product and seller.

149,Developing A Multi Criteria Decision Making Framework To  Select The Most Suitable Production Line In Apparel Firms:,"the apparel industry is considered as one of the most labor-intensive industries where production planning and control (ppc) is considered as an important function, because of its involvement from scheduling each task in the process till the delivery of customer demand. line planning is a sub process within ppc, through which the production orders are allocated to production lines according to its setting and due dates of production completion. the decisions that address line planning function still heavily rely on the expertise of the production planner. when production planners are required to select production lines for the production of a particular type of product, little emphasis has been placed on ways to apportion certain production orders to the most appropriate production system. in this research, a framework is developed using analytical network process (anp) which is a multi criteria decision making (mcdm) method, enabling the incorporation of all the planning criteria in the selection of a production line. the weighted scores obtained by the best alternative production lines are used in a linear programming model to optimize the resource allocation in an apparel firm.",march 7-11,"This research study proposes a Multi Criteria Decision Making framework to be used to in apparel firms, for the production line selection process. Line selection criteria was selected through an extensive literature review and expert opinions form different organizations covering a vast range of apparel products. ANP method was selected after carefully analyzing and comparing other MCDM methods based on the ability to consider dependence and feedback between the problem criteria. Data collection and analysis phase was conducted as a case study, therefore the criteria rankings received as the results are based on the case study organization’s perspective. However, this framework can be applied to any apparel firm for any kind of production order. When using the framework for other apparel firms, the priority ranking can possibly be different based on the organizational setting and its policies. Even within the same organization, the result can be different from one person to the other, therefore composite index has to be used when achieving the final result. As discussed earlier current practice on scheduling daily production in the production lines is based on the experience of the management. Therefore, the Managers could use this Multi Criteria Decision Making model as a scheduling tool to improve the production scheduling for better system performance. Further this Multi Criteria Decision Making framework enable the decision makers to understand the impacts of the characteristics of apparel production systems and parameters in the manufacturing environment on production system performance which can thus provide insights into the selection decision. This proposed model guides the decision makers to select the best production line for a particular production order through a collaborative decision making framework and increase the production planning efficiency in the apparel sector. Further, this framework can be improved to be used in other manufacturing organizations with modifications through further criteria identification. Therefore, it is concluded that the main objective the research is attained. Research deliverables can be used to optimize resources of apparel firms, to improve planning and manufacturing efficiency and hence earn profits. Apparel industry, being one of the major contributors to Sri Lanka’s economy through exports, can be further developed as a profitable sector and to achieve global excellence.","use of anp method thalagahage n.t.h, wijayanayake a.w., d.h.h. niwunhella department of industrial management faculty of science, university of kelaniya sri lanka anni@kln.ac.lk, thalagah_im15055@stu.kln.ac.lk, hirunin@kln.ac.lk",
150,High-End Disruptive Innovation As Exemplified By  Balmuda Case,"for a brand to avoid commoditization and survive, innovation that exudes outstanding originality and creates a new category is crucial. although multifaceted research into various aspects of innovation theory has flourished in recent years, relevant empirical studies have all focused on brands with a history and, in many cases, already substantial management resources. however, as exemplified by silicon valley ventures, the multitude of emerging brands that suddenly sprout and prosper are faced with a pressing need to grow. deficient in management resources and low in market recognition, these emerging brands must achieve outstanding product differentiation by competitively altering value dimensions in order to become brands that sell well despite their high prices.",emerging brand,"and Issues This study has proposed the concept of “high-end disruptive innovation”, which creates products that avoid commoditization by altering previous value dimensions and consequently sell well despite their high prices, and examined the case of Balmuda. We established the existence of high-end disruptive innovation, which cannot be explained by Christensen’s innovation theory in the prospective research. We then introduced the following hypothesis: “To avoid commoditization, brands that undertake outstanding differentiation and continue to grow must incorporate new value dimensions, not just performance (functional value), and achieve high-end disruptive innovation.”. This study’s methodology derived the elements of high-end disruptive innovation by analysing marketing mix and focused on the example of the emerging brand “Balmuda”, which has garnered enormous attention in recent years. Our results indicated that Balmuda offered a value concept unprecedented in the existing market, which radically improved consumer lifestyle and transformed non-consumers into consumers with a product selling at a price multiple times higher than commoditized products. Balmuda’s example constitutes empirical evidence that the new concept of “high-end disruptive innovation” proposed by this study has been translated into practice. As demonstrated by this study’s results, high-end disruptive innovation is highly effective and brings sustainable growth to emerging brands lacking in management resources. Further, this proposition is effective not only for emerging brands, but also small and family brands, or regional/local industries that have not yet seen the full light of day. Moreover, in a society overflowing with material goods, an increase in the number of creative brands deploying high-end disruptive innovation will engender brisker market activity, boost employment, and foster economic growth. Therein lies this study’s significance. Going forward, more industries and brands other than those highlighted by this study can be empirically investigated to corroborate our conclusions. However, the reality is that emerging brands able to achieve outstanding differentiation and sustain growth are few in number. Finally, this study was completely premised on a commoditized market. In other words, it presumes a market in developed countries or developing countries at a similar level, where consumer goods are abundantly available. Luxury brands have been continuously expanding distribution in countries exhibiting spectacular growth, thereby extending high-end disruptive innovation via distribution networks, not only in their country of origin, but also any country where consumers can afford to pay their prices. It goes without saying that parallel efforts to promote globalization should not be neglected.

152,Application Of Computer Vision In Pipeline Inspection  Robot,"industrial structures such as pipes develop issues over time which are primarily due to ageing, corrosion, cracks, or other forms of mechanical defects which could potentially lead to leakages or further uncontrollable fatal occurrences. as a result, inspections of such industrial structures are therefore of extreme importance. while prevailing inspection techniques are usually sensor based, time-consuming and labour-intensive, the application of robotic systems significantly reduces the human effort required for the same level of inspection. in this paper, implementation of a vision-based approach and a suitable low-cost solution was developed for detecting defects in industrial structures such as pipelines and hollow cylindrical structures. the camera embedded in the robot is used to identify defects such as cracks, corrosion and blockage in real time through a systematic algorithm of dataset training (1500 datasets) representing these conditions. this paper also focuses on the modelling and analysis of the dataset training of a pipeline inspection robot. the machine vision system thus developed was capable of effectively detecting defects even in low light conditions with a mean average precision of 91%.","computer vision, inspection, pipeline","This paper discussed the details surrounding the development and application of computer vision system used in inspection and automatic defect identification. The system design is based on defined requirements and operating conditions where the inspection is to be performed. The whole system is mounted on a mobile tracked robot which aids in inspection of industrial structure such as pipelines and hollow cylindrical structures. The key elements required were the camera, lenses, locomotive system and the processing platform. Based on the above results, it can be deduced that the new design choices introduced in the mechanical design of the vertical climbing mechanism of the robot for crack inspection is appropriate as per specifications and can be proceeded further with the analysis of crack image inspection using the camera. It is also deduced that the further analysis can be done on this to improve the accuracy of crack image identification and is left for future work.","oyekola peter oluwatosin, shoeb ahmed syed and owen apis department of mechanical engineering, papua new guinea university of technology petertosin@gmail.com, shoeb.syed@pnguot.ac.pg somade kolawole mtn nigeria kolsomad2010@yahoo.com",
153,Ferromagnetic Climbing Robot For Industrial Flaw  Detection: An Implementation Of Computer Vision,"in order to maintain a safe working environment, there is a constant need for the inspection of structures for failure. one common problem faced during inspection is restricted access to the inspection site. furthermore, inspectors use sensors like cameras and non-destructive testing kits to detect structural failures such as cracks and corrosion. still, due to the size and complex geometry of most structures, inspection is expensive, time-consuming and potentially unsafe. this paper, therefore, describes the design of a robot that can be used for non-destructive inspections of various range of structures to improve and automate structural inspections. in order to achieve this aim, different existing robotic designs have been reviewed, with focus on wall-climbing robots in similar environments. the final design combines a set of actuator motors, magnetic tracked wheels to aid vertical movement on magnetic structures, as well as a wireless camera for visual inspection and manoeuvring the robot system for the identification of surface cracks and corrosion using yolov4 machine learning algorithm. the structure of the tracks allows the robot to climb over uneven surfaces like bulwark, obstacles etc. which allows inspections in unfriendly and inaccessible environments therefore reducing costs and inspection time considerably.","computer vision, ferromagnet, inspection, robot",,"peter oyekola department of mechanical engineering, tennessee technological university petertosin@gmail.com","References

The three objectives of the study, 1. Identify benefits for adopting big data in SMEs; 2. Identify challenges faced by SMEs; and 3. Identify challenges for adopting and using big data in SMEs, were addressed through a desk-review approach, using an explorative method. Several articles, government reports, and related publications were reviewed. It was discovered that SMEs find it difficult to use big data tools and technologies because of they do not have the relevant skills and sufficient money to purchase them. However, big companies and SMEs that use big data analytics are succeeding and have a higher chance of increasing their profit. The study recommended that custom-designed training be made available for SMEs. Higher learning institutions should assist in making such programs available. The government needs to provide financial and non-financial support to SMEs that enables them to purchase and use big data tools and technologies. The field would benefit from future studies that look at refining big data tools and technologies for SME purposes. This would give SMEs the technologies and tools that could be easily used by them. An action research approach would be useful when such technologies and tools are created, so that they can be tested on SMEs.","lawrance seseni and charles mbohwa department of quality and operations university of johannesburg auckland park, johannesburg, 2006 sesenilawrance@gmail.com cmbohwa@uj.ac.za",
155,Examining Relationship Between Maintenance Management  And Sustainability In Buildings: Literature Review,"maintenance is defined as the combination of all technical and associated administrative actions intended to retain an item in, or restore it to, a state in which it can perform its required function. whereas sustainability is considered as an appropriate framework to gather all efforts aimed at improving the built environment through the development of social, economic and environmental aspects. the problem this paper has to deal with is the inefficiency of current maintenance management practices of sustainable buildings. the purpose of the study is to examine the relationship between maintenance and sustainability in buildings. this study counts upon a literature review to investigate the importance of maintenance, approaches to sustainable building maintenance, relation between maintenance and sustainability, sustainability-related trends of maintenance management, building maintenance management and frameworks for maintenance and sustainability processes. upon examining the previous discussed topics, a number of focal points and gaps have been found ,these include; the elements of sustainable agenda to be taken into consideration for new buildings; the detailed factors of sustainability that have an effect on maintenance, the impact of maintenance on sustainable buildings; meaning how far sustainable strategy has an effect on maintenance and explaining the correlation between maintenance and sustainability, other current and futuristic maintenance management trends that should be applied to sustainable buildings, in addition ,a gap has been detected in the analysis of case studies and international examples for using sustainable factors in maintenance management, the frameworks that are concerned with the relation between sustainability and maintenance in buildings.",march 7-11,,"youhansen mohamed a. salaheldine masters’ student, architecture department faculty of engineeing, ain shams university cairo, egypt youhansen@yahoo.com ahmed atef faggal professor in architecture department faculty of engineering, ain shams university cairo, egypt ahmedfaggal@gmail.com laila mohamed khodeir professor in architecture department faculty of engineering, ain shams university cairo, egypt drlailakhodeir80@gmail.com","References

156,Service Quality Assessment Of An Academic Library In  Thailand Using Servqual,"this paper aims to assess the overall service quality of an academic library in thailand in delivering its services. an analysis of the importance ranking of the service quality items and dimensions is also done. a survey is conducted among undergraduate students, graduate students, and faculty members as the library users. a user-based service quality tool developed by parasuraman et al., the servqual model, is used to do the assessment, with modifications to the dimensions to fit library settings. the gap differences between the desired expectation level and the perceived level of each service quality item are examined, supported by the analysis of means (anom). zone of tolerance is used to see which service quality items exceed, fall, or in the range of user’s acceptable level of service. finally, the dimensions are ranked according to their importance, where library as a place ranks first and collection and access ranks the least important. this is the first time an effort has been done to assess the academic library and it is hoped this paper can be a guideline for the library to improve its services.","servqual model, service quality, library services, academic libraries","This paper assesses the overall service quality of an academic library in Thailand from its users’ perspective using a modified SERVQUAL dimensions and service quality items. A bilingual survey questionnaire was used to collect data from the university students and faculty members. Respondents were asked to score the service quality of the Central Library from 1 (lowest) to 7 (highest) on three levels: desired level, minimum level, and perceived level. The gap differences between desired and perceived levels of all service quality items were examined, where they indicate large gaps in service quality items related to the library as a place and collection and access dimensions. Although large gaps do not necessarily mean the service quality items have higher desired expectation levels, it is still important to note that large gaps mean the levels of services currently provided by the Central Library are significantly different from what the users expect. From the zone of tolerance graph, there is not a single service quality item that is outside the zone. All items are still above the users’ average minimum acceptable level, however, none of them fulfils the users’ desired expectation. Therefore, the Central Library might want to pay more attention not only to improving areas that have significant gaps in order to minimize the gaps, but also to give attention to all services so that it can improve the overall service quality. This paper also examines the rank of the dimensions’ importance and all service quality items’ importance, by ranking them according to the highest to the lowest desired expectation levels. Higher desired expectation level is assumed to suggest higher importance to the users. From the analysis, the most important dimension is library as a place, followed by effect of service (personal), effect of service (organizational), and collection and access. The first ranked service quality item, “a comfortable and inviting library location”, is inside the library as a place dimension and this suggests that the Central Library users expect highly of the library as a “place”. Users also expect the library staff to be knowledgeable to solve their problems or inquiries and assisting them in considerate manner. The collection and access dimension is the least important among the other dimensions, which may be because users mainly come to the library to do their work using their own laptops and resources. They do not necessarily require resources available in the library to support their work or study, which makes users not access library collection as frequent. This is the first time a study has been conducted to assess the service quality of the Central Library. Using a modified SERVQUAL that has four dimensions, 25 service quality items were constructed to fit the survey in library settings. It is hoped that this study can be used by the Central Library to continuously improve its services for its users. Lastly, this study has its own limitations that might be considered for future research. The time to conduct this study was short, for only one month, so not enough data were collected. More of the university students and faculty members and hopefully campus staff should be involved in the survey to make this study more comprehensive and representative. The Central Library can also personalize its services to fulfil the expectations of the university students, faculty members, and staff, by identifying the difference between desired expectation levels of service quality items based on the user groups.","tyas wahyu pramesti department of industrial and systems engineering sepuluh nopember institute of technology surabaya, indonesia tyasms@gmail.com assoc. prof. tossapol kiatcharoenpol school of engineering king mongkut’s institute of technology ladkrabang bangkok, thailand tossapol_k@yahoo.com",
157,The Impact Of Digital Technology And Industry 4.0  On Enhancing Supply Chain Resilience,"globalization has been increased and generates more complex supply networks and connections. therefore, supply chains are facing unforeseen disruptions that can halt production and cause delays in providing service. mckinsey reported that only 21% of supply chain organizations believe they have a high resilience network during the covid-19 pandemic. most organizations face different challenges to keep their network active during covid-19 due to a lack of transparency through the network. covid 19 pandemic expedite the activities of transferring to digitalization among leaders. in this study, the impact of implementing blockchain and industry 4.0 have been discussed. a supply chain management company are considered to evaluate the impacts of digitalization. a discrete event simulation has been run with two scenarios (scenario one: no digitalization, scenario two increase the transparency by implement digitalization). the results confirm on average, a 17% improvement in resilience level by increasing transparency.","supply chain, resilience, industry 4.0, blockchain","Accessing and sharing the precise data and information through supply network components is a vital factor of an organization’s performance, but there is an obstacle that all network players can trust each other and the accuracy of information. Digitalization could be an acceptable solution that enables them to share accurate information securely and generate more reliable and trustworthy systems in the network. Blockchain and industry 4.0 technology can establish and generate secure and immutable records of data that can be used and view by all network players without allowing them to alert it. This research study demonstrates how employing blockchain and industry 4.0 can impact network resilience and performance indexes. A supply chain simulation model has been developed to certify the benefit of employing these technologies by carrying out two scenarios: one without considering any sharing information and the other sharing information by applying industry 4.0 and blockchain technologies. The results demonstrate that digitalization can enhance supply network resilience when operational disruption events happened at each network players and is a convenient tool to collaborate with trustworthy and in a secure environment. The results confirm a positive impact on reducing lost demand, shortage inventory, and delay delivery with acceptable total cost. Digitalization in supply chain management is still in infancy steps; it can be future research to looking into other applications and benefits in strategic or operational stages that may attract supply chain managers to adopt and implement these technologies. -1 1 3 5 7 9 S1-R1 S3-R1 S2-R2 S1-R3 S3-R3 S2-R4 S1-R5 S3-R5 Connection SC1 SC0 Proceedings of the 11th Annual International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management Singapore, March 7-11, 2021","elham taghizadeh department of industrial and system engineering wayne state university detroit, mi 48035, usa elham.taghizadeh@wayne.edu elaheh taghizadeh quality assurance and process analyst, saman electronic payment (sep), tehran, iran elahe.tz2007@gmail.com","References

In this scope, the presented cloud- based system could aid logistics companies in order to achieve more effective, cost-efficient and environmentally friendly order deliveries to their customers. More specifically, the convenience, reliability and security provided by the system, can lead logistics companies to better control their processes, increase their efficiency while also ensuring the quality of their services/products. All these benefits are vital for logistics companies operating in today’s competitive environment. The technologies used for the development and the interconnection of the system and its individual subsystems are the key part for the successful provision of the software solution. The technologies needed for the development of the system included the development platform framework, the cloud computing service, the web services, the application programming interfaces, the communication protocols and the database. The implementation of these technologies enabled the development of an advanced cloud-based information system for vehicle routing and scheduling, especially in urban areas. The main advantage of the developed system and the implemented technologies is that it can be easily applied in every logistic company, as a cloud service, while it deals with critical constraints of the routing and scheduling problem, like traffic congestions and exceptions during the execution of the schedules. The developed system has been already tested and its operation has been simulated using data from real-life logistics companies. The next goal of our research is to validate the system with the delivery operations of specific logistics companies in real-life conditions. The results of the various performed tests and system validation will be then evaluated and any necessary improvements will be implemented to the system, in order to be ready for exploitation by the logistics sector.

168,A Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process Approach To Identify  The Relative Importance Of Factors Influencing Air Cargo,"it is crucial for countries located in mountainous areas where the surface transportation system is extremely poor to have effective air freight capabilities. as a case study, the objectives of this research are to identify the principal factors required to enhance air cargo operations at paro international airport in bhutan, and to prioritize the importance of each factor to determine solutions for the effective development of the airport. the study utilizes the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (ahp) as its research methodology. according to the analysis of the data obtained via the ahp survey through air cargo management experts in bhutan, cargo handling infrastructure is identified as the most important area needing improvement, followed by airport charges and cargo security service. this study finds three main conclusions. first, the airport authority should devise a financing plan, and this plan should utilize airline participation if the airport authority does not have a sufficient budget for airport infrastructure development. second, the airport should look to utilize a small number of employees who can perform multiple duties. for instance, security functions and customs functions for cargo operations could be carried out via combined procedures by multi- functional staff members, which would reduce operational costs and cut back on airport charges related to cargo operations. third, the airport should increase its supply of flight services by lobbying for economic deregulation in the aviation industry. this could, for example, pave the way for foreign airlines to start using the airport.","fuzzy ahp, bhutan","As a land locked country, Bhutan’s air transportation has become crucial in finding solutions to promote economic development. First, sufficient hardware infrastructure must be developed for the gateway airport. To facilitate this, it may be useful to devise financing strategies with user participation (e.g. with national airlines). Second, airport services need to be provided at reasonable costs and with acceptable quality. Because there are not many skilled workers and only a modest level of demand in Bhutan’s aviation industry, it would be prudent to cultivate a small team of staff members that can perform multiple duties. For example, within the scope of cargo operations, duties related to security and customs could be handled by the same employees. Third, it would be advantageous to increase the supply of flight services via the economic deregulation of Bhutan’s aviation industry. This would allow foreign airlines to open routes to the gateway airport of the country.

169,Application Of Vehicle Routing Problem To Determine  Optimal Route In Fuel Distribution: A Case Study,"as a country with quite a lot of motorized vehicle users, fuel is an important requirement for the indonesian people. apart from being used for transportation, fuel is also used to support various sectors. thus, the supply of fuel is something that is vital to pay attention to, especially in relation to fuel distribution. problems related to the distribution of fuel include making decisions regarding the distribution routes between gas stations. the choice of vehicle route will determine the total distance traveled by the fleet to create an optimal distribution system, so that route selection must be effective and efficient. this study discusses the distribution of fuel from boyolali fuel terminal to gas stations in several of the residences in surakarta and western eastern java. vehicle routing problem (vrp) is used to solve the problem and google or-tools algorithm and python programming are used to get the minimum total distance from the fuel transport truck. the results of this study are the acquisition of a new distribution route so that the distance of transportation decreases by about 60% than before.","fuel, distribution route","The Boyolali Fuel Terminal is tasked with distributing fuel oil to refueling stations in several areas, such as South Semarang, Salatiga, Surakarta, Sragen, Boyolali, Sukoharjo Klaten, Wonogiri, Karanganyar, Purwodadi, Blora, Ngawi, Magetan and Pacitan. Boyolali Fuel Terminal distributes BBM to 238 gas stations. It has to optimize the distribution of fuel to gas stations to achieve operational excellence. In this study suggest Boyolali Fuel Terminal to use only 8 trucks to distribute fuel in Boyolali area. Another trucks can be rellocated to another area. This article has certain limitation that should be overcome in order to provide in deep analysis on the vehicle distribution analysis. For further research will complete the research with additional constraints such as time windows, pickup and deliveries, dimensions and resource constraints to increase the closeness of the solution to the real system.","era febriana aqidawati master program of industrial engineering department, faculty of engineering universitas sebelas maret surakarta, indonesia erafebrianaaqidawati@student.uns.ac.id maulana ichwan anshory, aprilia dityarini, yuniaristanto, wahyudi sutopo, brahmastya artanto industrial engineering department, faculty of engineering universitas sebelas maret surakarta, indonesia maulanaichwana@gmail.com, apriliadityarini@student.uns.ac.id, yuniaristanto@ft.uns.ac.id, wahyudisutopo@staff.uns.ac.id, brahmastya.artanto@gmail.com",
170,A Framework Of Performance Efficiency Measurement In  Technology Transfer Office (Tto) For Acceleration Of,"technology commercialization is a means of utilizing research result technology in both production and consumption activities so that researchers can benefit from these activities. in many cases, many research technology products fail to enter the market due to the valley of death. this obstacle usually occurs in the transition process between technological development and technology commercialization. therefore, critical action is needed to accelerate the commercialization of technology so that the commercialization potential of research results does not fall into the valley of death. higher education institutions are expected to take part in this process to accelerate the transfer of new technology products to the market. to manage the commercialization of new technology, it is necessary to establish a technology transfer office (tto). the tto has a key role in providing structural links between universities and industry. to achieve this, this study becomes a preliminary study to design a framework for measuring the performance efficiency of a tto. several research models have been developed to measure efficiency. the model developed in this study refers to the goldsmith commercialization model and trl. the goldsmith model was chosen as the reference method because this model is specifically designed to analyze the strategic and systematic commercialization of technology. trl was chosen as an assessment of the readiness of research results using the techno-meter approach. these two models are combined to design a framework for measuring the efficiency of tto performance for accelerating technology commercialization.",,"The framework has been designed to develop a model for measuring the efficiency of TTO performance in universities. The model developed aims to measure the efficiency of TTO in accelerating commercialization. This model integrates the conceptual approach of Goldsmith Commercialization Technology, TRL, and CRL. From the results of the analysis of the efficiency measurement, it can provide suggestions to TTO stakeholders in Higher Education on what needs to be done to improve the efficiency of TTO performance.

171,Supplier Selection Using Technique For Order Of Preference  By Similarity To Ideal Solution (Topsis) Method: A Case,"selecting suppliers of goods for procurement becomes very complex because often a large number of criteria need to be considered and some of the criteria cannot be properly assessed. fluctuations in supplier performance and unknown information are always in decision making. choosing the right supplier can reduce operating costs, increase profitability and product quality, increase competitiveness in the market, and serve customers quickly. this study aims to propose a method that can facilitate practitioners to select suppliers logically and when uncertainty and/or unavailability of assessment information arises. we applied the multi-criteria decision making (mcdm) method to determine the best alternative from several alternatives based on certain criteria. the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (topsis) method is also used in several multiple attribute decision making (madm) models because this method has several advantages, namely the concept is simple and easy to understand. this research was conducted at a raincoat manufacturing company, namely pt. trijaya plastik. the main ingredient in making raincoats is pvc (polyvinyl chloride). due to the large number of suppliers who can provide goods, this study examines the selection of pvc suppliers for the company's main material. the result of normal topsis calculations in supplying the main raw material or pvc is the second supplier, namely pt. royal lapastek by considering 4 criteria, namely price evaluation, condition of ordered goods, delivery time, and administrative evaluation.","procurement, topsis, surakarta",,"study nida an khofiyah master program of industrial engineering department, faculty of engineering universitas sebelas maret, jl. ir. sutami, 36 a, surakarta, indonesia nidaankhofiyah2@student.uns.ac.id sulvi fitriani, syifa luthfiana asnan industrial engineering department, faculty of engineering universitas sebelas maret, jl. ir. sutami, 36 a, surakarta, indonesia sulvifitriani@gmail.com, syifafia06@gmail.com wahyudi sutopo university centre of excellence for electrical energy storage technology research group industrial engineering and techno-economic, industrial engineering department, faculty of engineering universitas sebelas maret, surakarta, jl. ir. sutami, 36 a, surakarta, indonesia wahyudisutopo@staff.uns.ac.id",
172,An Application Of Ewma Control Chart For Monitoring  Packaging Defects In Food Industry,"this paper puts forward the concept of optimizing the exponentially weighted moving average (ewma) control chart for effective monitoring of the increasing shifts in defective rate in food packaging. optimizing the ewma charts mainly aims at enhancing the product quality and the customers’ contentment, along with reducing both production costs and waste. the average number of defectives (and) is used as an overall performance metric for guaranteeing the highest detection power of the optimal ewma chart with respect to various sizes of shifts. records of the packaging defects were collected from a food company in order to illustrate the implementation of the proposed optimal ewma chart. the optimal ewma chart is compared with the optimal np chart and the results of this comparative study reveal that the former exceeds the latter by 69% in terms of and.","control chart, packaging, ewma chart","To conclude, this paper evaluates the effectiveness of the overall performance of the optimal EWMA chart for monitoring the packaging defects in food industry. It demonstrates its high overall performance in comparison to the optimal NP and traditional EWMA charts. The optimal EWMA chart shows the highest overall performance in terms of AND. Using out-of-control data, the EWMA chart gives a signal and detects the increasing shift in packaging defects faster than the NP and traditional EWMA charts. This paper underlines the advantage of utilizing the optimization in control charts, which results in better overall effectiveness of the control charts and helps companies reduce waste and enhance the quality of the end products.

173,Configurable Framework For Smart Serious Game Analytics,"serious game has been introduced as an interactive educational tool for teaching and learning processes. it incorporates non-entertainment elements into an interactive game environment. although serious game offers various benefits to support teaching and learning in a variety of contexts, measuring the learner's skills and knowledge improvement is difficult. two main problems are: 1) how to understand the learner’s skill and performance improvement, and 2) how to capture and analyse the data. this work aims to tackle the second problem by designing a flexible serious game analytics framework. it focuses on identifying the relevant data to evaluate learner’s skills and knowledge improvement for a specific intended learning outcome, as well as, gathering this data in a serious game framework that can be configured based on the intended learning outcomes of the game. comprehensive literature reviews and field study, including observations and semi-structured interviews, were conducted to consider different gameplay data and identify the necessary gameplay data for a particular learning outcome. based on the findings, a serious game framework is developed. this framework would be implemented as a configurable setting for the smart serious game analytics engine.","serious game, configurable, analytics engine","This paper focuses on designing a serious game analytics framework to identify relevant data and analyse the data to evaluate learner's skills and knowledge improvement for a specific intended learning outcome for a particular programming subject. Comprehensive literature review in serious game design framework and serious game analytics, as well as field study that includes observations and semi-structured interviews, was conducted to consider different components and gameplay for the framework. Based on the findings in the literature review and field study, we propose a serious game analytics framework that consists of two engines, namely: serious game engine and analytics engine. To enable flexibility in the configuration, the game and analytics configurations (i.e. assessment points, gameplay data, analytics results) are saved in a shared database that can be accessed by the game engine and analytics engine. To validate and enhance our proposed serious game analytics framework, we see two possible extensions that we would like to study in the near future. First, we would like to implement the two engines based on our framework to a specific programming subject such as Introduction to Python. The implementation will help us to validate if the configurable framework can capture both gameplay data and analyse the data to identify the learner’s skills and knowledge improvement. Second, we would like to work closely with the lecturers to determine additional information or insights that they would need to analyse the learner’s improvement. It would further enhance the analytics capabilities of the framework.

175,Product Environmental Quality Assessment: An Appraisal  Model For Corporate Decision-Makers,"environmental quality of products is determined by several intrinsic characteristics and other characteristics that are not related to the product itself but rather to the supply chain process. in this paper we present a mathematical model that illustrates the impact of several factors related to the activities of the supply chain on the environmental quality of the products to be manufactured. this model allows the determination of environmental quality of each product, thus its effect on the environment. for this purpose, we have adopted the most cited indicators in literature that significantly influence environmental quality of products to better reflect this quality. this model is based on the aggregation of the adopted indicators. during the aggregation we faced a difficulty that affects the inequality of indicators importance (corporate strategy, type of industry, ...) which leads us to weight these indicators to express their relative importance. to do this, we have used the principle of weighting of analytic hierarchy process method which is simple to use and allows to take into account both the quantitative and qualitative criteria. by this work, our ambition is to provide for corporate decision-makers a real tool which will allows to know precisely the quality environmental of each manufactured product, thus it will be less difficult to know the actions to be taken to increase company’s profit and to reduce its negative impact on the environment.","product, supply chain, indicator","Companies have made tremendous progress in environmental protection abreast of recent years. Faced with popular and regulatory pressures, they have had no choice to develop an environmental management strategy increasingly rigorous. However, in many organizations, environmental issues remain on the margins of activities producing value. This is one reason why environmental protection is seen even today as an additional production cost. Applying sustainable development principles in industrial management stills a difficult task. In this sense, companies have a little tools and consulting firms are often helpless against the demands of companies that want to engage in CSR strategy. In the origin of this paper, was the problem of environmental impacts of manufactured products. In this context, our goal has been to provide an assessment model of product environmental quality. It was also for us, to assist in the definition of targeted axis of the progress allowing to evolve evaluation systems of environmental performance in company. The first goal of this work is to lay the foundations for a new generation of environmental indicators which permit the determination of product environmental quality. The model presented in this paper promises advance in environmental performance assessment of products and makes environmental information more useful for decision-makers. Any company and based on this model, can know environmental qualities of their products and therefore their achievements towards environment. Even though further development is called for, it is evident that this model has the potential to become very useful as one of the available tools. The combination of better assessment methods is likely to continue this movement towards a new generation of integrated sustainability performance reports. Among the limitations of this model is the need to integrate other indicators (recycling, remanufacturing ...) that will improve the accuracy of measuring the product environmental quality. In our next works we seek to develop this model considering the different aspects mentioned above. Our ambition is ultimately to provide real decision support tools that can be useful for the company and its stakeholders.","haddach abdelhay research team: materials, environment and sustainable development faculty of sciences and techniques, abdelmalek essaadi university, tangier, morocco haddachabdelhay@gmail.com","references. 
Indeed, pair wise comparison may lead to non-transitivity which cannot be removed as part of AHP method. 
However, perfect consistency rarely occurs in practice. In AHP method the pair wise comparisons in a judgment 
matrix are considered to be adequately consistent if corresponding Consistency Ratio (CR) is less than 10% (Saaty 
1980). CR coefficient is calculated as follows: first a Consistency Index (CI) needs to be estimated. This is done by 
adding the columns in judgment matrix and multiply resulting vector by vector of priorities (i.e., approximated 
eigenvector) obtained earlier. 
This yields an approximation of maximum eigenvalue, denoted by  𝜆𝜆𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 . Then, CI value is calculated by using the 
formula: 
𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶= 𝜆𝜆𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚−𝑛𝑛
𝑛𝑛−1
                                (04) 
Next, CR is obtained by dividing CI by random consistency index (RI) as given in Table 3.

Otherwise matrix A should be evaluated:

The most influential dimensions of mental workload are effort, which is caused by monotonous work, high concentration levels, and musculoskeletal symptoms due to repetitive work. In order to reduce employee effort at work, it is necessary to design an ergonomic job. While the characteristics that affect the mental load of difficult type assembling workers are mainly behavior. High mental load will certainly affect the behavior of workers where there are demands for time at work, so that it has the opportunity to increase errors and cause stress (frustration). Increased frustration results in decreased assembling worker performance. This is in line with Zhang (2019) research which states that high mental workload can increase the likelihood of operational errors and accidents. Therefore, further research to explore this matter will be very useful, especially in the context of years of work and work shifts which of course affect mental workload and worker productivity. The results also showed that there was no significant difference in mental workload based on worker age, as well as no significant differences across all NASA-TLX dimensions. This suggests that age does not affect the mental workload of workers assembling difficult type products.","toto indonesia linda theresia, gadih ranti, ni made sudri industrial engineering department institut teknologi indonesia, indonesia tarlind@yahoo.com, gadih63@gmail.com, sudrimade@yahoo.co.id",
178,Easy To Produce And Low-Cost Ergonomics Full-Face Mask  Design Against Airborne Transmission,"a new variant of the coronavirus known as covid-19 was declared as a global pandemic virus at the end of 2019. the spread of a virus's outbreak can occur in various ways, such as contact with an infected person through droplets. the nature of the virus, which is easily transmitted between people, will exacerbate the spread of covid-19. the shortage of mask supplies has happened globally, and the price of the mask became costly. surgical masks or cloth masks are the minimum personal protective equipment recommended by the authorities to control the spread of diseases in many countries. the surgical masks or cloth masks or even the n95 type of mask still have the vulnerability in an environment with the potential for airborne spread of viruses. the safer and more effective personal protection equipment (ppe) against possible airborne transmission of the virus is the full-face mask equipped with an air filter. unfortunately, providing the full-face mask during the pandemic, especially at the beginning of the pandemic, was not possible since its complexity and made the price expensive. this study aims to share our design and experiment of a full-face mask as a ppe for mitigating virus transmission. there are three aspects in designing a full-face mask, i.e., ergonomics design, availability of materials, and ease to produce. anthropometric dimensions of the face are applied in designing product sizes to fit with the user size. the full-face mask design creates two segments of the mask, namely the mouth and nose segment and eye segment. a rapid prototype has been applied to design the mask's mold using 3d printing and resin solid casting. the mask's primary materials must accommodate the two requirements, i.e., easy to get and low-cost material. the required materials to produce a full-face mask are pvc plastic sheet (3mm), rubber seal, and air valve or filter. the vacuum forming production concept is the most applicable to create a mask easy to produce and in a short cycle time. a full-face mask prototyping has been created in our study and offered the alternative of ppe to protect people from virus transmission. future development of our mask design might be considered the ppe rapidly with a low selling price.","full-face mask, vacuum forming, ergonomics design","The design of a full-face mask provides an effective and efficient alternative to fulfill the need for self-protection from the virus's spread through the respiratory system. The vacuum forming tool's design can produce a full-face mask following the full-face mask technical design. The short vacuum forming time per product provides an overview of the promising capacity of mass production. PVC plastic sheet as the primary material for the full-face mask is a material that is readily available and at an affordable price. The concept of a two-segment full-face mask needs to be tested in the technical laboratory stage to see the ability to filter against undesired external particles such as viruses. Furthermore, future studies are needed to design a filter that effectively yet still efficient. 7.","arief rahman, retno widyaningrum, anny maryani, aldi yustisia, putra bagus satrio industrial and system engineering department institut teknologi sepuluh nopember surabaya, indonesia arief@ie.its.ac.id",
179,A Tri-Level Ahp Approach For Port Logistics Personnel  Performance Evaluation,"nowadays, logistics industry has become a critical component in the commercial link, and it is very important on how to find the optimal performance in sea-trade. besides, modern logistics industry has brought many additional values in order to increase the value of transportation services such as electronic tracking, warehousing, and resources distribution and 90% of global trade in malaysia is done through marine transport. as the marine logistics industry grows globally, the need for talents and manpower to support the industry, especially in port operations also grow. delivering a flawless service becomes a source of competitive advantage for the logistics industry. to do that, a good development of capability of professionals in terms of manpower and expertise is needed. moreover, with the current situation of pandemic covid-19, a capable professional in port operations are highly needed in order to revive the industry after being affected as well as ensuring its future growth and sustainability. this development of capability includes many criteria which reflected the capability and competency of personnel might have changed over time and so its performance evaluation, especially before and after the pandemic. thus, a good business performance measurement system is a very powerful tool to excite and monitor personnel of a company. it is rare to find a well-designed system even though there is a lot of interests and studies in creating performance measurement model. in this study, a systematic approach for multicriteria decision-making (mcdm) tool, the analytical hierarchy process (ahp) is adapted in determining the criteria for evaluating the performance of port logistics personnel. performance criteria from the literature and expert opinions were utilized prior to the development of the performance evaluation model. a tri-level hierarchical structure of criteria, with three (3) criteria at the first level, six (6) sub-elements at the second levels and 19 sub-elements in the third levels (with 3 for each sub-element of the second level) is adapted in the study. the result shows that among the sub-elements at second level, team cooperation is the most considered criteria when evaluating the performance of a personnel in port logistics for both countries malaysia and indonesia where the sub-elements that scored the highest are 0.31 for cooperation spirit in malaysia and 0.27 for sharing knowledge in indonesia. both elements are from second level of sub-elements of team cooperation. 4 more criteria are having very minimal weightage. the concern of the ahp is to obtain consistent judgement from the expert that somehow will affect the results and vary accordingly. proceedings of the 11th annual international conference on industrial engineering and operations management singapore, march 7-11, 2021 © ieom society international 2209",,"As the marine logistics industry has become a critical component in the commercial link, the need for performed talents and manpower to support the industry is of competitive advantage to the nation. This study explores the criteria for needed talents in view of port logistics experts ranging from middle to top management as well as those teaching and training manpower for the field. The MCDM method, AHP is used to measure the important of proposed criteria and rank those based on their opinion. The method is selected based on its ability to consider many criteria simultaneously as well as considering the subjective judgement by the participating experts from two neighbouring countries, Malaysia and Indonesia. Results show that the level of agreement on the proposed criteria from the respondents are 78.2 percent agreeing and 90.8 percent for Malaysia and Indonesia respectively. In the second phase of the calculation, where a tri-level hierarchical structure of criteria is used, the result shows that among the main elements, Work Attitude is the most considered criteria when evaluating the performance of a personnel in port logistics at 0.769 and 0.541 for Malaysia and Indonesia respectively. Further analysis on the results for both countries on the important of sub elements show that there is significant different between the opinion of the experts from the two countries. Hence, this calls for further research on several related issues. Among which are to get respondents from more diverse fields in marine logistics such as shipping lines, forwarding and port managers. Respondents from neighbouring ASEAN countries are also good potential respondents for expert opinions in order to ensure the performance criteria used for evaluating the marine logistics practitioners in the South China sea operations. At the same time, the AHP method of ranking the criteria can further be enhanced with inputting an evaluation factor for determining the proposed criteria. In many previous research, fuzzy elements are adapted for the evaluation instead of scoring approach used in this study. The results from this AHP can also be compared with other MCDM approach such as Goal Programming (GP), techniques for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS) and multi-objective optimization on the basis of ratio analysis (MOORA).

180,Optimization Of Location Selection For Electric Motorcycle  Charging Station: Distance-Based Method Approach,"the mass adoption of electric mobility will reflect advances in the vehicle itself, its infrastructure network, and its position in the automotive market. progress in these areas is highly related, and mandates coordinated design efforts. discuss ongoing developments and future trends in charging systems for e-motorcycle vehicles. e-motorcycle can grow rapidly if supported by facilities in certain areas that can be used to exchange batteries or recharge batteries because the batteries used have the maximum capacity so that electric vehicles also have limited mileage. this research uses a supply chain network model to determine charging station facilities in semarang city to achieve coverage from the fewest number of charging stations and minimum investment costs. the method used in determining location distance uses a distance-based by solving problems built from combinations and modifications of models in previous studies, and models run using cplex. from the results of operations using ilog cplex, it was found that the optimal results of charging station locations are 4 location points (e2, j1, n3, and o2) with each districts having one charging station that can provide recommendations and input to the semarang city government in the problem of providing charging stations.","charging station, e-motorcycle, location facility","The development of a supply chain network model for the charging station case in Semarang has been carried out. The model has been run considering the location of the selected candidate filling station. This model can provide input to local governments regarding the optimal solution in determining the location of E-Motorcycle charging stations.

182,Location Optimization Charging Station Of Three-Wheel  Electric Vehicle: A Case Study,"to supporting the downstream and commercialization of the battery electric vehicle (bev), universitas sebelas maret is developing a battery-based three-wheeled electric vehicle. this 3-wheeled electric vehicle has the advantage of being more stable in use and can carry passengers or goods. however, in the application of the use of 3-wheeled electric vehicles, there is no sufficient charging station to support mass use, so people are still reluctant to use it. the supply chain network design is needed to analyze the optimum location of the charging station. this study proposes the location of a 3-wheeled electric vehicle charging station to achieve the widest possible coverage with the least number of charging stations and minimal investment costs with a case study in the city of surakarta. potential public facilities that are used as locations for charging stations are markets and malls, both of which are frequently visited and easily found by the public. the method to be used is a modification of the backup coverage model and the distance- based model run with ibm ilog® cplex® optimization. the results obtained are a recommendation to the city government to support the acceleration of electric vehicles, especially 3-wheeled vehicles in surakarta.",charging station,"In this research, the Three-Wheel Electric Vehicle charging station location is proposed to solve the problem of optimum charging location to support the acceleration of electric vehicles, especially three-wheeled electric vehicles, with a case study in the city of Surakarta. This model has been implemented by considering 3 levels/scenario types of charging stations. This model can provide input to local governments regarding the optimal solution in determining the location of the Three-Wheel Electric Vehicle charging station.

183,A Mixed Integer Programming Model For Fuel Efficiency  With Logistics Uncertainties Impact,"total supply chain management cost has always been the interest of many companies in these recent economies. the aim to survive and sustain is important these days. sustainability in road transport operation can be measured by how the transport company manages the fuel consumption for its vehicles or trucks. fuel efficiency is one of the key points to measure the success of road transport operation. it can be achieved by controlling the right variables such as speed, weight or volume of transported good, travelled distance and other related variables. however, all the variables are highly affected by the logistics uncertainties such road congestion, faulty vehicles, error in information and many more. in this study, a fuel namely diesel usage optimization model that consider the effect of the logistics uncertainties is proposed. the mixed integer programming model that considers truck tonnage, its age, model and travelled distance as the controlled variables while delay, wrong information and changes in demand volume (carried volume) as the constraints is adapted using a 3-month data from a freight forwarding company. the model is solved using excel solver and shows that different models at different age are losing the fuel efficient, but the difference is not significant. at the same time, delay and wrong information do not have effect on fuel efficient but changes in demand volume largely affect the fuel efficiency by 20.4 percent for the three-month data. the sensitivity analysis for the upcoming months are also done.","— diesel usage, fuel efficiency, 2012). firstly","and Recommendation The study concludes that incorporating the uncertainties in road transport operations can result in less fuel efficiency and some variables (tonnage, age and model of vehicles) can be managed for better efficiency. To control the fuel consumption, road plan is needed to get better fuel efficiency. For example, choose the route which has less road congestion, plan the delivery early before the peak hour because truck might get stucked in heavy traffic thus led to unnecessary idling. The important things are to optimize the cargo for truck to reduce the overweight loads. Besides that, there are some other factor could affect the fuel consumption such as driver behaviors such as aggressively driving, speeding, and harsh braking. The unnecessarily idling while waiting for cargo to load ls have effect in fuel consumption. Based on this factor, fuel efficiency can be controlled and monitored by transport manager and operation to sustain road transport operation. Further analysis using several other formulations in measuring the fuel efficiency need to be done while incorporating the uncertainties into the calculation. The best practice in fuel management will prevent or at least we can predict the uncertainty that might occur. 3.66 3.58 3.81 3.54 3.43 3.69 3.79 3.54 3.77 3.2 3.3 3.4 3.5 3.6 3.7 3.8 3.9 Fuso Hino Nissan May-20 Jun-20 Jul-20 4.66 3.76 5.87 3.25 2.45 6.50 6.50 6.50 3.85 2.68 0.00 1.00 2.00 3.00 4.00 5.00 6.00 7.00 3 Ton 5 Ton 7.5 Ton 10 Ton 40 FT Average of 3 Month Average Average of Target Average Proceedings of the 11th Annual International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management Singapore, March 7-11, 2021","mohammad al-yanieff iqkhmal, s.sarifah radiah shariff, mohd hafiz afifi azmi malaysia institute of transport (mitrans) universiti teknologi mara, shah alam, selangor, malaysia iqkhmal_89@yahoo.com, shari990@uitm.edu.my, hafiz.afifi0601@gmail.com s.sarifah radiah shariff centre for statistics and decision science studies, faculty of computer and mathematical sciences, universiti teknologi mara, shah alam, selangor, malaysia","References

184,"Operating Room Scheduling By Considering Surgical  Inventory, Post Anesthesia Beds, And Emergency Surgeries","surgical operating rooms are critical in the total hospital costs, while surgical care accounts for one-third of hospital costs. thus, successful and improve operating room management and scheduling can bring significant benefits. in this study, we develop operating room (or) scheduling problem integrated with a post-anesthesia care unit (pacu) by considering emergency surgeries during the covid-19 outbreak. accurate prediction of surgery duration and required pacu time for each surgery are critical for operating room scheduling. due to the inherent uncertainty in surgery duration and pacu time, we develop supervised machine learning to estimate surgery duration and pacu time. finally, based on discrete event simulation, we compare our proposed surgery scheduling model to the available scheduling by using statics and data from montreal's hospitals. we could show that our scheduling model can significantly increase operating room utilization with the issue of pacu congestion.",machine learning,,"to improve efficiency during the covid-19 outbreak with machine learning shahab amrollahibiouki, prof. yvan beauregard mechanical engineering department école de technologie supérieure montréal, h3c 1k3, canada shahab.amrollahibiouki.1@ens.etsmtl.ca, yvan.beauregard@etsmtl.ca",
185,A Reactive Scheduler For Closed Loop Control Systems  Using Historical Run-Time Statistics,"this paper presents a method of scheduling tasks of a closed loop control system on multi-core systems using historical statistics - mean run-time and standard-deviation in run-times - of the tasks. the run-time statistics is used to first predictively and then to reactively schedule the tasks in order to minimize the makespan. the predicted schedule is a list of tasks ordered by a function of mean and standard deviation, to be executed on each core. reactive scheduling involves periodically probing the progress and reacting to imbalances in progress across the cores by altering the schedule. it is shown that, when the tasks have high variance in run-times, this method results in smaller makespan compared to a non-reactive scheduler using plain heuristics. this method also performs better than the default linux os task scheduler for such tasks. 9% improvement in makespan over os task scheduler is noticed for a workload comprising of 1100+ cpu intensive tasks with high standard deviations in run-times on a 20-core system.",makespan,"In this study, a single-threaded reactive scheduler (controller) for scheduling a group of repetitive CPU intensive tasks in closed loop control system was designed, implemented and evaluated on a multi-core server. The controller uses historical run-time statistics μ for allocation of tasks and f(𝜇𝜇, 𝜎𝜎) for ordering the tasks to be able to better manage unexpectedly longer runtimes than expected. At pre-defined configurable intervals, the controller checks the progress on each resource and, if necessary, balances the load based on μ and reorders the tasks. None of the papers surveyed use this approach for scheduling repetitive tasks for minimizing the makespan. Performance of the controller was evaluated by measuring the makespan of a group of large number of tasks and comparing it with the elapsed time noticed with the default Linux CFS scheduler. The tasks used for performance evaluation were abstractions of a real-life closed loop control system. The makespan was measured with the controller running in reactive mode (reacting to load imbalances) and in predictive only mode (i.e., no load rebalancing, vanilla LPT heuristics). When the deviations in run-times are significant, it was noticed that the re-active scheduler outperformed both the OS task scheduler and the predictive only scheduler when more computing resources were available.

186,Occupational Accidents And Prevention Through Design In  The Malaysian Construction Industry,"the construction industry plays a vital role in the social and economic development of all countries. however, it considered as one of the most vulnerable field to work-related injuries and fatalities. thus, construction workers' safety and health should be considered as top priority. in this respect, this study focus on investigating the occupational accidents fatality and highlight the variables linked to the fatality as well to focus on prevention of the occupational accidents during the designing phase. the population size of this study is n=210 accident cases, the data collected from the department of occupational safety and health (dosh). the study identified the relationship between fatality and 210 accidents occurred in malaysian construction industry in the year 2018. frequency analysis, cross tabulation and logistic regression implemented to analyze the dependent variable (fatality)'s relationship with seven independent variables using statistical tools, which include gender, nationality, cause of accident, type of accident, body part, agent of accident and month of accident. the outcomes of the statistical analysis show 6 independent variables except gender have significant link to fatality, and especially cause of accidents, type of accident and body part. they have strong relationship based on phi or cramer’s v test. also, preventive strategy for occupational fatal falls accident highlighted based on the falls are the leading cause of accidents. designers can obtain great benefits from these results because some variables, can provide them with practical approach to hazard identification and design solution integration.",,"During the past decades, the construction industry has been considered as one of the most vulnerable field to work- related injuries and fatalities, where construction workers' safety and health are not usually considered as top priorities because the contractors, who are normally small sized construction firms or self-employed, do not have safety budget to deal with construction workers' safety. The main objective of this study to highlight the construction fatal accidents and investigate the variables connected to fatality, although to provide the designers with some prevention through design strategies to reduce or eliminate the fatal fall accidents. The relationship between fatality (dependent variables) and 7 independent variables such as gender, cause of accident, body part and month of accident was investigated.210 accidents occurred in the industry in the year 2018, the data analysed using SPSS software to highlight the frequencies and the relation to the fatality. The outcomes of the statistical analysis show 6 independent variables except gender have significant link to fatality, and especially cause of accidents and ,type of accident and body part have strong relationship based on Phi or Cramer’s V test. Also, preventive strategy for fatal falls accident highlighted based on the falls are the leading cause of accidents. Based on the outcome of the analysis highlighting falls accident as the main cause of accidents some designing guidelines suggested based on the previous studies such as parapet wall on roof edge, fall prevention through skylights, roof anchors, fixed ladder and prefabrication and assembly at ground level. The lack of experience and expertise in implementing safe design processes is a major barrier; researches suggest that designers have difficulty recognizing hazards and incorporating design solutions when applying safety concept design to their design process. The basis of the study was that the previous studies discussed the concept of construction safety design is the most effective approach to the prevention of occupational accidents within the construction industry but many professionals working for construction don’t agree of this concept. The findings of this study are essentials in terms of reducing cost, saving time for designers and contractors and also saving lives in the site. As a recommendation for further studies it’s required to do deeper investigation about the cause of accidents and highlight the factors involved to cause the accidents, although further studies required in terms of prevention through design concept and a trial of the concept on sites and analyse the progress and efficiency of the suggested concept.","mohammed yahya ali yahya school of mechanical engineering, faculty of engineering universiti teknologi malaysia 81310 utm johor bahru johor, malaysia yaymohammed3@gmail.com jafri mohd rohani school of mechanical engineering, faculty of engineering universiti teknologi malaysia 81310 utm johor bahru johor, malaysia jafrimr@utm.my",

188,"The Effect Of Mental Workload, Stress, And Learning  Motivation On Student Learning Achievement During Online","educational institutions have fully implemented online learning during the 2020 school year due to the covid-19 pandemic. the significant change in the learning model drives students to make some adjustments. this situation needs reviewing to see the indication of the effects that may arise as a result of online learning. this research aims to measure those possible indications, such as mental workload, stress level, and learning motivation and their effects on learning achievements. for this research, the focus is on students of a university in surabaya. based on an initial questionnaire distributed, 50% of the respondents stated that the delivery of material through online learning is considered less effective and that 66% of the respondents stated that online learning affects their stress level. this measurement seeks to give an overview that will help educational institutions better develop online learning methods for future terms. the methods used to measure these indications are the draws, slsi, and mslq methods. the result shows that the motivational variable and academic stress significantly affects the students’ academic performance, and that mental workload did not affect the academic performance significantly.","online course, draws, slsi","and Suggestions The calculation of mental workload using the DRAWS method shows that the majority of the students experiences the overload mental workload. However, when it is observed based on the dimensions, the time pressure dimension has the highest average score compared to the other three dimensions. The calculation of academic stress using the SLSI instrument shows that the majority of the students experiences moderate stress level. When it is observed according to the type of stressors, the ‘Change’ dimension has the highest average score. In the reaction to stressors category, the ‘Physiological’ dimension has the highest average score. The calculation of students’ learning motivation using the MSLG instrument shows that the majority of the students have a moderate motivation level. When the motivation level was observed from the value components aspect, the extrinsic goal orientation has the highest average score, the expectancy components aspect has the highest average score for control of learning beliefs dimension, and the affective components aspects has the lowest average score compared to the previous two dimensions. By using ordinal logistic regression analysis, it was obtained that academic stress and learning motivation significantly affects the academic performance, yet, mental workload does not affect the academic performance significantly.

189,Banish Waste In Warehouse Operations Using Lean Matrix,"lean thinking has been widely implemented on manufacture or service industry to eliminate waste. inventory has been known as one of the well-known seven waste that is needed to be removed. on the other hand, it is not easy for any industry to manage their supply chain without any inventory buffer in their warehouse. as warehouse operations cost could consume up to half of supply chain cost, it is necessary to improve its efficiency. application of lean warehousing could lower costs and optimize resource utilization which bring benefits not only for the warehouse but also the whole supply chain. implementation of lean warehousing requires supporting tools that is nowadays mostly adopted from generic tools as in lean manufacturing. very few studies are available on lean warehousing and even fewer studies on specific tool for lean warehousing. this study proposes a new tool for lean warehousing implementation, which is called lean matrix. lean matrix has a simple structure as it only consists of two matrix but it serves as a comprehensive and integrated tool. this tool offers support from identification of waste and its causes, analysis of critical waste, until formulation and prioritization of waste elimination plan. moreover, lean matrix also considers waste relationships and impact of waste to company’s performance. the first matrix of lean matrix produces list of critical waste and its causes as well as critical area where waste occured. the second matrix provides list of waste elimination or reduction plans as well as their prioritization. this tool is then applied to an starch and sweetener company in indonesia. overprocessing and transportation are two major waste identified in the case study. these waste are occured in external warehouse building and two waste elimination actions are suggested accordingly.","lean thinking, lean warehousing, waste",,"putu dana karningsih department of industrial and systems engineering institut teknologi sepuluh nopember surabaya, jawa timur 60111, indonesia dana@ie.its.ac.id",
190,Customization Measurement In Reconfigurable   Manufacturing Systems (Rms),"with increasing consumer demand for a greater variety of products in changing and unpredictable quantities. manufacturing different products tailored to the needs of their clients is a real challenge that industries face today. today's consumers are looking for products that carry part of their identity and allow them to stand out from the crowd. in this context many indicators have been proposed to evaluate the reactivity and flexibility of a production system; such as customization, scalability and convertibility of the system. customization is one aspect of flexibility; it expresses a system's ability to produce customized products with customized functionality. this document develops a measure of customization of reconfigurable production systems. these measures do not only impact the production system but also the product design and the process design, which can therefore serve as a guide for the customization of manufactured products. a case study is presented to show the use of the proposed approach.","customization, measure","By integrating process and product information, this document provides a customization indicator for reconfigurable production systems. The customization metrics defined here provide a quantitative assessment of system customization. This measure is particularly useful for quantifying the synergy of the product family, for comparing systems, and for arguing the decision regarding the plant in which a specific variant can be produced. Initial experimental results have shown the effectiveness and usefulness of this indicator to help product and assembly line designers and process planners make the right decisions to ensure optimal customization of their production system. A case study is presented to show the successful application of the proposed approach. In developing the measurement of customization of reconfigurable production systems, we do not consider other factors of production such as production cost and batch size are not included in the evaluation process. Therefore, in future research, it is necessary to determine the actual production conditions and take into account factors such as production cost and batch size, in order to obtain evaluation results that are closer to reality.

193,The Impact Of Intrusion Detection Systems Upon Healthcare  Environments: A Research Review,"as healthcare systems throughout the globe face an influx of new information exchange due from a variety of different network transferences, the caution that arises from utilizing such technologies can distinguish which healthcare systems are equipped to handle potential cybersecurity attacks and breaches in comparison to those who are not. this study seeks to review research that is currently available pertaining to the impact of intrusion detection systems (ids) upon different healthcare systems and the networks in which they exchange patient health information (phi) and electronic health records (ehr) pertaining to their hospital and clinical experiences. the growing concern for patient information assurance is brought forth and substantiated as more and more healthcare providers switch to digital platforms for storing patient information and their staff exchange information for efficient healthcare practices. whilst different researchers approach ids from different perspectives in regard to healthcare, the outcome suggests neural network approaches such as autoencoding and fuzzy logic can help dispel potential breaches and network security threats from intercepting phi as it is shared.","intrusion, detection, system, network","Overall, as healthcare systems and settings continue to expand and evolve beyond the context of small, highly specialized clinical settings and larger, in-patient healthcare conglomerates, the networks in which they utilize for information exchange and the maintenance of EHR must follow suit. As the components of EHR expands with on- going factors such as each patient’s healthcare experience, age and treatment outcomes, the exchange and relay of their PHI becomes increasingly extravagant to maintain, let alone assure in terms of privacy and security. Therefore, it is important that healthcare providers, especially those which partake in patient information exchange on a frequent if not continuous basis take into consideration the variety of security threats that may affect them and those they care for. Such measures may be considered a preemptive and proactive approach towards potential liabilities and against incoming risks from both internal and external threats. Ultimately, the outcome of this research review suggests that novel approaches towards regulating and reviewing information exchange that is transferred throughout healthcare system networks are better regulated and ensured through newfound approaches within intrusion detection systems (Chen et al, 2016). Amongst such novel approaches, included those which prominently featured neural networking approaches in their methodology and techniques. Amongst the variety of different networks that utilize IDS, multiple articles noted that neural networking techniques such as fuzzy logic (Elshoush & Osman, 2011). In addition to this, other approaches such as stacked autoencoder was also commonly observed amongst different authors in suggesting alternative models of methodology. This neural network approach features multiple layers of autoencoders which are dispersed in an infrequent format. Each of these layers is connected to one another through producing a “stacked” formation and relaying information accordingly. In contrast to this, the fuzzy logic methodology of neural networking features a Boolean approach which allows numerous different variables to be condensed as they are processed through a single or similar component (Singh et al, 2013).

195,Assessing The Gap Between Offshoring Expectations And,"modern firms must be willing to consider offshoring engineering labor to reduce costs and accelerate development in order to compete in the emerging electric vehicle (ev) market. currently, there is some information available regarding guidance and factors to consider when managing offshored technical services, but the guidance is written at a high level and it is not relevant specifically for design engineering departments. it may be difficult for firms to discern what guidelines are applicable to their industry, and whether those guidelines correlate to their specific engineering department. this paper explains a research instrument used to identify stakeholder needs in new offshoring programs, as well as identify performance gaps in existing offshoring utilization. the research instrument design is based on the servqual methodology and it leverages existing offshoring guidelines and considerations, which are aligned to the mckinsey 7-s categories. this tool was applied to an existing ev firm’s engineering department and it highlights some specific offshoring performance gaps that can be addressed by the department. these gaps were centered around specific facets of organizational strategy, structure, and values.","offshoring, engineering, ev","and Recommendations There are published guidelines and considerations that exist for firms considering offshoring implementation as well as for firms managing existing offshoring efforts, but these are all written at a high level from an overall business perspective. There is a gap in the literature in terms of limited considerations for individual department levels. In general, offshoring guidelines are designed to encourage decision makers to perform an internal analysis of their firm. These guidelines align well with the McKinsey 7-S internal analysis framework because they focus on the different functions and operations within the firm and they neglect external factors which are irrelevant to the internal operations of an organization or department. The most common attributes of the 7-S framework to appear in the literature are organizational Strategy, Structure, Systems, and Shared Values. The research instrument presented in this paper can be applied to any industry utilizing an engineering department that is considering or currently managing offshoring resources. The questions have been validated for engineers in the EV market, but new markets should consider validating the questions before implementing the tool. This tool leverages the SERVQUAL survey methodology to generate a quantitative list comparing a respondent’s perception of an ideal offshored organization’s performance against their own experiences with an offshored team. The criteria used to develop this research instrument is an example of one possible combination of tools, as there are other survey formats and internal analysis frameworks that could be applied to the same dataset to yield different results. The quantitative validation analysis shown under the Analysis section verifies that the guidelines considered are appliable to the surveyed engineering department, ensuring proper stakeholder management. The following gap analysis shown in Table 6 and Table 7 identified that the firm’s main offshoring performance gaps were based on their organizational strategy and organizational structure as it relates to offshoring. This tool has been designed where it can be implemented in three different scenarios: 1. An organization currently utilizing offshoring resources would use this tool to identify performance gaps experienced by the engineering department, and then use the output to drive improvements. This is the root output of a gap analysis and can be seen in Table 6 and the subsequent analysis. 2. An organization considering the offshoring of engineering functions would use this tool to gather the engineering department’s top concerns when designing the new organizational strategy and structure, Proceedings of the 11th Annual International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management Singapore, March 7-11, 2021","kent derbyshire engineering management & technology university of tennessee at chattanooga chattanooga, tn 37403, usa why575@mocs.utc.edu aldo a. mclean engineering management & technology university of tennessee at chattanooga chattanooga, tn 37403, usa aldo-mclean@utc.edu","References

With this grouping, decision makers will be able to see which aspects of e-government maturity from their organizations are still lacking and need improvement. The decision maker could make policy to prioritize the improvement in input, process, or output aspects. Further research can be conducted to examine how the dimensions of each of these aspects can affect the maturity of e- government implementation and prove whether maturity in the input aspect will affect the process, and ultimately also affect the output.","naning aranti wessiani department of industrial and system engineering institut teknologi sepuluh nopember (its) surabaya, east java, indonesia wessiani@ie.its.ac.id patdono suwignjo department of industrial and system engineering institut teknologi sepuluh nopember (its) surabaya, east java, indonesia patdono@ie.its.ac.id atikah aghdhi pratiwi department of industrial and system engineering institut teknologi sepuluh nopember (its) surabaya, east java, indonesia atikah@ie.its.ac.id tyas wahyu pramesti department of industrial and system engineering institut teknologi sepuluh nopember (its) surabaya, east java, indonesia tyasms@gmail.com",

The results provide insights to the policy makers, enforcement agencies, businesses on how to improve the cross-border operation of halal food at the entry point that could assure the Halal integrity. This study strongly recommended that an effective halal goods clearance system across border need to be in place in accommodating Halal trade.

An individual’s intent years to stay was used to determine an individual's turnover intention. Results show that tenure has no significant effect on an individual’s intent years to stay. Educational attainment, job satisfaction, and outside workplace characteristics show a significant impact on an individual’s intent years to stay. Individuals with higher educational attainment tend to jump to other organizations for a shorter period. These individuals have higher expectations that are often unmet by their current organization. Job satisfaction is a reliable indicator of an individual’s intent years to stay. Satisfied individuals tend to have a stronger commitment to their current organization. Job satisfaction is profoundly affected by job performance and job characteristics. An excellent performance in an organization is treated as a reward that boosts an individual’s satisfaction. Job performance indirectly affects an individual’s intent years to stay through job satisfaction. Organizations can boost job performance through training, mentorship, and recognition. Among these three programs, trainings are the most effective program to increase job performance. However, recognition and mentorship are also significant factors that organizations should consider. Results show that job title has an inverse relationship with job performance. As an individual gain higher rank titles, the pressure to perform better decreases as they gain a sense of accomplishment of reaching new ranks. Outside workplace characteristics have a direct effect on an individual’s intent years to stay. Significant intervention programs that affect and individual's perception of outside workplace characteristics are car support and housing support. Car support has a higher positive effect on an individual’s perception of outside workplace characteristics compared to housing support. Developing countries treat car ownership as a symbol of social status. This makes car support as a form of retention program effective. The organization should focus its resources on retention programs that change an individual's perception of job characteristics. Job characteristics have an indirect effect on an individual’s intent years to stay. It also affects job performance and job satisfaction that boost productivity in the organization.","richard drix a. piatos, rex aurelius c. robielos and ma. janice j. gumasing school of industrial engineering and engineering management mapua university intramuros, manila, philippines rdapiatos@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, racrobielos@mapua.edu.ph, mjjgumasing@mapua.edu.ph",
202,Analysis Of Airline Domestic Operations Using Linear  Programming,"air transportation facilitates integration of the global economy and plays a vital role in both local and global economic development through the increasing passengers and freight traffic demands. thus, this paper aims to minimize the operational cost of a budget airline’s fleet operation by selecting the most suitable aircraft type among the company’s existing fleet using the analytic hierarchy process (ahp). then, the linear programming method was used to optimize the allocation of fleet to its operations that will minimize the daily operational expenses in nineteen (19) proposed domestic destinations from manila. the linear programming model considered the following constraints: (1) supply of available seat must meet passenger traffic demand (2) minimum flight frequency requirement (3) assignment of aircraft type to destination’s airport and (4) available fleet operating hours per aircraft type per day. the results obtained the frequency of flights per aircraft type per route to nineteen (19) domestic destinations that meets the passenger demand at minimum cost to the airline company. in addition, it was also realized that the fleet size could be reduced based on the remaining available hours of operation. the optimal solution maximized the available operating hours of the a330-200 and a321-200 ceo aircraft type. the a330-200’s high seat capacity catered to the high demand of the destination. despite the highest operational cost among other aircraft types, it was able to transport more passengers in one flight. while only 21% of the a321 neo’s operating capacity was utilized. therefore, the a321 neo’s fleet size could be reduced to only 1 aircraft. both the analytic hierarchy process (ahp) and linear programming (lp) were an effective tool in supporting the decision-making process of airline domestic operations. the ahp was able to determine the most suitable aircraft. and the lp optimized the fleet operations at minimum cost. both methods could also be further improved by considering additional factors such as aircraft operational compatibility for ahp and other factors affecting flight operations for the lp model.","linear programming, regional","This paper sought to model the problem of selecting the most suitable aircraft to operate and minimizing the daily operating costs. The study used the analytic hierarchy process in selecting the aircraft to be used in the daily operations. And then, the linear programming was applied to find the optimal solution to the flight frequency distribution per aircraft type per route to the proposed destinations with the goal of minimizing the cost. From the analytic hierarchy process, we have determined that the most suitable aircraft is the A330-200. This is due to its high passenger & cargo capacity, maximum take-off weight, and low cost per available seat mile (CASM). However, not all airports in the Philippines are capable of accommodating such aircraft type. It was realized that the aircraft operational compatibility with the destinations’ airports should also be considered. Ultimately, the process supported the airline in choosing the aircraft type most suitable to operate in its domestic operations considering the various criteria. This allows the airline’s fleet planning and operations to choose the right aircraft from the set of alternatives. It is shown that AHP can be used as a support tool in the aircraft selection process. After the selection process, we applied linear programming to minimize the daily operational expenses of the airline company. According to Dozic & Kalic (2014), an airline is interested in carrying out the planned traffic with the least possible number of aircraft, the lowest possible operating costs, and the highest aircraft utilization. With the use of excel solver for linear programming we were able to identify the frequency of flights per aircraft type per route to nineteen (19) domestic destinations that meets the passenger demand at minimum cost to the airline company. In addition, it was also realized that the fleet size could be reduced based on the remaining available hours of operation. The optimal solution maximized the available operating hours of the A330-200 and A321-200 CEO aircraft type. The A330-200’s high seat capacity catered to the high demand of the destination. Despite the highest operational cost among other aircraft types, it was able to transport more passengers in one flight. While only 21% of the A321 NEO’s operating capacity was utilized. Therefore, the A321 NEO’s fleet size could be reduced to only 1 aircraft. The linear programming method was an effective tool in allocating the right aircraft to right destination while considering the operational constraints. This tool provided the company the flight frequency allocation per aircraft type per route to minimize the cost of its operations. In addition, it was also able to determine the appropriate fleet size for the given operational setting of 19 domestic destinations. For its implementation, it is realized that the model requires real-time knowledge of the potential daily demand and the actual availability of each aircraft. The model could also be further enhanced by considering other constraints such as actual crew scheduling, flight scheduling, airport traffic and many other factors affecting flight operations. Both the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and linear programming (LP) were an effective tool in supporting the decision-making process of airline domestic operations. The AHP was able to determine the most suitable aircraft. And the LP optimized the fleet operations at minimum cost. Both methods could also be further improved by Proceedings of the 11th Annual International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management Singapore, March 7-11, 2021","ralph andre c. roque, rex aurelius c. robielos and ma. janice j. gumasing school of industrial engineering and engineering management mapua university intramuros, manila, philippines racroque@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, racrobielos@mapua.edu.ph, mjjgumasing@mapua.edu.ph","References

203,Analysis Of Road Traffic Accident Criticality In  Calabarzon Philippines,"this study explored the relationship of multiple factors on the criticality of road traffic accidents in calabarzon philippines. five thousand data points from doh hospital records were used to generate a statistical analysis that can interpret the relevance of each factor on road traffic accident criticality. the significance of each factor was verified through one-way anova. the criticality of road traffic accidents is measured using mean and standard deviation. results showed that large vehicle size is most likely to cause critical accidents. driver's age is also a predictor of road accident criticality. it suggests that older drivers are more likely to be involved in critical road accidents than younger drivers. the criticality of road traffic accidents is also dependent on the congestion of the road. the highly congested road tends to limit the driving speed, which reduces the fatality of accidents. from these results, it is highly suggested to impose stricter traffic laws on vehicles that have a larger size. also, this study recommends the renewal of a driver’s license since age has a strong positive correlation with the criticality of traffic accidents. overall, this study was able to predict the impact of each factor with the criticality of traffic accidents.","calabarzon, anova, pedestrian","This study investigated relevant factors that affect the criticality level of road traffic accidents. Significant factors that affect the criticality of road traffic accidents were identified to be driver age, driving time, driving day, and province. Results showed that there is no significant difference between male and female drivers on the criticality of the accident. This study breaks the current stigma that female drivers are more likely to have a critical accident than male drivers. However, the driver’s age proved to have a significant effect on the criticality of the accident. The regression analysis had verified that the criticality of the road traffic accident increased as the driver’s age increased. Thus, there should be a stricter law that governs drivers with a higher age group. The government should impose driver license renewal while testing the capability of the driver. Other professions suggest mandatory seminars and pieces of training gain points for a driver’s license renewal. Time and Day are indicators of road traffic accident criticality. Critical accidents tend to occur late at night. Other literature suggests that late-night driving tends to have a smooth flow of traffic. Drivers tend to abuse the continuous flow of traffic and drive at a faster speed. Thus, accidents late at night tend to be more fatal. Traffic congestion also explains why Wednesday is the safest day to operate. The traffic flow is heavily congested during the middle of the week. Road traffic accidents that involve motorcycles tend to be the least critical. It breaks the prevalent stigma that motorcycles are the most dangerous road vehicle. Moreover, accidents that involve heavy vehicles such as trucks and buses are the most critical traffic accident. The government should reinforce law-governing traffic to reduce the number and criticality of accidents. Since driving speed was determined to have a significant effect on accident severity, the government should review the enforcement of operating speed, especially late at night, where there is a smooth flow of traffic. The government should treat the result as a warning to create and improve better roads for drivers. Since traffic congestion affects accident count, road widening and addition of lanes are highly encouraged, especially in highly dense cities such as Santa Rosa City in the province of Laguna.

206,An Ergonomic Workstation Design For Apparel  Manufacturing Workers In The Philippines,"latest data from the philippine statistics authority shows that apparel production volume registered significant year- on-year growth rate index of 35.9% in the value of production (psa, 2017). the local garments industry is picking up, leading export growth in the first four months of the year. industry leaders said that the philippine garments industry has bigger chances of growing faster. however, since the textile and apparel industry has been growing, this leads to dangerous occupational safety and health conditions for workers. because of this, it became the research interest of authors to conduct an ergonomic workstation design for workers in apparel manufacturing company. initially, the body discomfort experienced by workers in their current work setup were identified using cornell musculoskeletal disorder questionnaire (cmdq). then factors that affect the discomfort of workers were identified based on review of related literature, actual observation and interview from the respondents. 150 subjects were included in the study consisting of knitting, cutting and sewing operators. factors that were considered in the study are age, bmi, duration of work hours, years of work experience, and other personal factors like smoking habits and alcohol intake. afterwards, multiple regression analysis was used to identify significant factors affecting the body discomfort workers. then, using the rapid upper limb assessment (rula) the level of risk of workers were assessed based on their working posture. finally, using the principles of anthropometry, an ergonomic workstation design was developed and were compared to present design of workstation to know if there is a mismatch and identify the gaps in the design.","workstation design, ergonomics","For the conclusion of the study, the following points were inferred in the analysis, first, based on the evaluation of MSD using CMDQ, the workers in knitting, cutting and sewing operations experience body discomfort on their lower back, lower leg, upper arm, neck and foot. Second, based on the result of regression analysis, it was proved that personal factors that significantly affect the prevalence of body discomfort of workers are BMI, years of working experience, smoking habits and alcohol intake. Additionally, the result of the RULA had proved that there are 5 different tasks that pose high risk of upper limb disorder for workers and these are putting of thread rolls in knitting machine, putting of oil in roller / removing fabric, cutting of cloth, spreading of cloth and sewing. Lastly, using the anthropometric data obtained from respondents, we were able to design an ergonomic workstation for workers. These workstation design where then compared to the existing design of workstation and determined that there is a mismatch or gap between the design that that is why the workers to experience body discomfort while performing their task.","paul jan v. saguyod, almarose c. villapando and ma. janice j. gumasing school of industrial engineering and engineering management mapua university intramuros, manila, philippines pauljan.saguyod@yahoo.com, acvillapando@mapua.edu.ph, mjjgumasing@mapua.edu.ph",

208,Analysis Of Supply Chain In A Liquified Natural Gas (Lng)  Company In The Philippines Using Optimization Models,"natural gas has remained the fastest growing energy resource in most regions of the world for more than two decades, driven by the low greenhouse gas emissions as well as high conversion efficiency in power generation. in the philippines, natural gas is one of the major energy sources specifically coming from malampaya gas field located 80 km northwest of palawan. this study analyzed the supply chain of liquefied natural gas (lng) by selecting the appropriate lng suppliers through analytic hierarchy process and minimizing operational cost by applying linear programming. using ahp, we identified important criteria that a company would consider in choosing a suitable supplier. in this model, it gives more weight on commercial criterion and price sub-criterion, as any fuel supply contracts can be considered as highly commercial transaction. fuel supply affects power generation cost as well as electricity prices paid by consumers. thus, consumers need to procure their fuel at the least-cost manner as possible. on the other hand, in terms of technical aspect, gas quality directly affects efficiency, soundness in operation and emission levels. for each cluster of suppliers, a mathematical model was developed to determine the optimum delivery to each cluster from variety of supply and constraints to minimize operational cost. understanding the impacts of restrictive provisions in long-term supply contracts, such as take-or-pay agreements, on overall business operation will save the buyer from high operational cost and profit reduction. the balance between long-term and spot supply must be well managed to maximize the benefit of entire supply portfolio. as the philippines is expected to become a new lng importer in the near future, for the reasons of energy security, ghg emission reduction and environmental concerns in power generation sector can be further studied. further, more comprehensive studies must be conducted to ensure that various considerations and real-life scenarios were taken into account.","optimization model, linear programming","With the help of optimization techniques used in this paper, we were able to analyze small-scale LNG supply chain and come up with a model that reflects commercial and technical constraints. Though it is concentrated on downstream LNG industry, specifically small-scale LNG, the methods and approach can be used for larger-sized LNG or any other energy projects. Energy projects are important to the growth and sustainability of an economy, thus decisions should be evaluated carefully using various methods. Using AHP, we identified important criteria that a company would consider in choosing a suitable supplier. The used of criteria and pairwise comparison put importance to priorities. Depends on specific needs, policy and strategy of a company, results may vary from one case to another. In this model, it gives more weight on commercial criterion and price sub-criterion, as any fuel supply contracts can be considered as highly commercial transaction. Fuel supply affects power generation cost and further, electricity prices paid by consumers. Thus, consumers need to procure their fuel at the least-cost manner as possible. On the other hand, in terms of technical aspect, gas quality directly affects efficiency, soundness in operation and emission levels. This method of supplier selection can be applied as well to selection of an engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) company that will develop an LNG import or export facility, or even identifying opportunities that will give the most benefit to the company with the guidance of their capability and company strategy. With enough data and information, we were able to determine the optimum delivery to each cluster from variety of supply and a number of constraints to minimize operational cost. Understanding the impacts of restrictive provisions in long-term supply contracts, such as take-or-pay agreements, on overall business operation will save the buyer from high operational cost and profit reduction. Balance between long-term and spot supply must be well managed to maximize the benefit of entire supply portfolio. In future decisions, it is recommended to create a model, such as the one used in this paper, to assess all factors affecting the business before making any commitments. It is advantageous to the buyer if long-term contracts are flexible such as having regular price review, take-or-pay level review and not penalizing cargo cancellations with enough advance notice. With this, buyer can used the most out of his supply portfolio. As the Philippines is expected to become a new LNG importer in the near future, for the reasons of energy security, GHG emission reduction and environmental concerns in power generation sector, papers like this will help the acceleration of corporate decision-making. Investments in LNG receiving facilities are capital extensive.

209,Towards The Application Of Pumped-Hydro Storage In  Nigeria,"acute electricity crisis characterised by epileptic and inadequate supply remains a major hindrance to achieving sustainable development in nigeria. the problems of poor electricity generation, transmission, and distribution have led to a slowdown of industrialisation. the effect of this is evident in the poor standard of living for the majority of the population and the poor state of the economy. while there have been concerted efforts at improving the power sector, pumped-hydro storage consideration and applicability as a potential solution has received scant attention in nigeria. meanwhile, its application in electricity networks merits reflection considering the present state of nigeria electricity. this study seeks to propose the application of p-hs in nigeria and the steps needed to support its adoption. the attempt thus raised a number of questions. such as, what are the possible factors that are slowing the application of p-hs? what are the needed steps to accelerate the p-hs application in nigeria? what are the specific ways in which p-hs can be applied to solve the country’s electricity problem? thereafter, a conceptual framework to describe our thought was presented and the implications of adopting p-hs in nigeria were discussed. these include energy storage, generation and ancillary services.","electricity, nigeria, economic",,"*oluseye a. adebimpe, victor o. oladokun and inyeneobong e. edem department of industrial and production engineering university of ibadan, nigeria. *oa.adebimpe@yahoo.com, vo.oladokun@ui.edu.ng, ie.edem@ui.edu.ng",
210,The Effect Of Icon Formats On Recognizability Of Traffic  Signs,"thirty-two per cent of indonesia's traffic accidents were caused by misperception (inability to understand) the traffic signs. as suggested by previous studies, the icon/symbol format taxonomy is an essential factor that determines the icon recognizability. thus, a suitable format of a road sign symbol will minimize the drivers' load of information processing. this study conducted a recognizability test on 28 traffic signs in indonesia, consisting of image-related, concept-related, semi-abstract, arbitrary, and dan combined formats. image-related icons presented a pictorial representation of an object or an action. concept related icons visualize a concept that is not represented in concrete images. arbitrary icons do not have an apparent reference to their intended meaning but become meaningful only through convention and education. semi-abstract icons combine image-related and concept related or arbitrary elements. in the combined icons, the graphical elements are combined with textual elements (i.e., words or abbreviations). quantitative parameters used in this study were response time and response accuracy. the participants consisted of eight men and eight women. participants had an age range of 19-24 years with a mean age of 21.56 (sd=1.59). besides, each participant had a driving license and normal or corrected-normal visual acuity. the average response accuracy and response time for all 28 icons tested in this study was 41% and 6.4 seconds, respectively. the one-way anova test showed that the road sign format significantly affected the response time and response accuracy (p <0.05). on average, combined icons have the fastest average response time (i.e., 5.92 seconds) and highest respond accuracy (58.72%) compared to other formats. on the other side, the arbitrary icon has the lowest recognizability rate compared to other formats with mean response time was 7.86 seconds and the mean accuracy was only 19.37%. this result suggested the need for better designs of several traffic signs in indonesia.","image-related, response time, response accuracy, indonesia",,"ratna sari dewi, miftachur rohmatin, anny maryani, dyah santhi dewi industrial and systems engineering department institut teknologi sepuluh nopember kampus its keputih, sukolilo, surabaya, indonesia ratna@ie.its.ac.id",
211,Rru 4G &5G Heatsink Design And Experimental  Evaluation,"active antenna unit-rru 5g 5g/remote radio unit-rru 4g lte heatsink systems are using natural convection cooling due to some outstanding advantages such as low cost, high reliability, noiseless operation, and hard environment operation. however, some main disadvantages such as a relatively low heat transfer and low heat dissipation density are to be solve by optimal heat sink fin design. so an analytic calculation and fem simulation is required to efficiently design natural convection heat sinks according to the applied design constraints. this paper describes an optimal heatsink fin profile design with v shape angle to maximize natural cooling for active antenna unit-rru 5g 5g. the proposal design is based from rru 4g heatsink simulation and experiment results. several core ics of rru 4g with high heat loss sources up to hundred w need to be dissipated by aluminum heatsink and enclosure or housing. the rru 4g natural cooling system is composed of parallel-straight plate heat sinks to find an optimum heat sink design based on an analytical calculation of entropy energy and heatsink resistance but the rru 5g 5g heatsink system is cooled by v sin plate heat sinks to improve heat exchange. temperature measurements were carried out to validate the rru 4g heatsink model and proposal design of rru 5g 5g heatsink is calculated by an analytical model and fem simulation. this paper will show an optimal calculation of rru 5g 5g housing heatsink fin to minimize manufacture and material cost.",,"that the V heatsink fins will be applied to the next manufactures. 6. Conclusion This paper has implemented analytical and FEM simulation methods for optimizing two parameters of heatsink fin distance and skew angle to find out minimum temperature or increase heat transfer factors. The described analytical thermal model reveals good results compared to thermal measurements over a wide range of power losses. Therefore, an easy to apply design method is given to efficiently design natural convection heat sinks of RRU 4G&5G. The analytical optimum design shows the potential of carefully designed heat sinks compared to commercially available profiles. Furthermore, the optimization is more efficient the better the base plate area is utilized. Thus, power modules might not be the preferred choice, but discrete semiconductors, where the power circuit might adopt an optimal shape of the base plate area.

This also aid in identifying the set of skills and technical abilities that students have acquired during their matriculation. This study considered the graduates of IE, EMG, and SEM programs of the subject HEI in the Philippines. The personal and employment profiles of the graduates were identified and revealed that most of the graduates have high level job positions and have been employed a few months after their graduation, signifying that the graduates are highly employable. However, the bachelor’s degree attained by the graduates and job title of the graduates have no correlation with one another as the Pearson correlation value obtained was less than 0.3. This suggests the possibility that a graduate may choose a different career path for personal growth and career development. There is also not enough evidence to suggest that a certain correlation between the respondents’ job title and year graduated does exist within the population. The relevant attributes of the HEI that helped in the graduates’ employability were also identified in the study. These include the range of courses offered (curriculum), number of optional courses concerning the program, number of compulsory (core) course, student workload, teaching quality, inter-disciplinary learning, facilities, research capacity, labor market relevance, industry linkage, and cost (of education). In terms of the skills and competencies, the graduates of the three (3) programs believed that they have excellent decision-making ability. Similarly, IE graduates felt that they have developed their problem-solving, critical thinking, creative thinking, ability to work independently, ability to work under pressure, time management, and initiative/risk upon completion of the program while for EMG and SEM, the graduates have identified many similarities with the IEs including leadership skills and human relation. In terms of work-related attributes, efficiency was viewed by IEs as their dominant character while the EMGs and SEMs recognized self-discipline and creativity and innovativeness. The levels of achievement of the PEOs were also satisfactory for all programs since the mean ratings of achievement were classified under very good and excellent. It is essential for schools and universities to conduct the graduate tracer study after several years to determine how relevant is the education they provide to the needs of the industry. It will also aid in improving the quality of education and services to make it at par with other education institutions.","engineering (ie), engineering management (emg), and service engineering management (sem) programs of an hei in the philippines josephine d. german, ma. lourdes o. buan, alyana bianca g. carreon, and marjorie joyce d. ochoa school of industrial engineering and engineering management mapua university, manila, philippines jdgerman@mapua.edu.ph, odessabuan11@gmail.com, yana.carreon@gmail.com, marchiochoa@gmail.com",

215,The Contribution Of Maintenance To Improve The Operational  Performance Of An Industrial Process,"in the petroleum industry, equipments must be maintained properly to meet the adequate reliability standards in order to achieve the desired business goals in terms of productivity, safety and environmental protection. this article offers a new approach focused on risk analysis to select a better maintenance strategy. the proposed approach consists of three stages. in the first step, we identify the accident scenarios that could lead to the loss of production and damage to the environment. in the second step, we estimate the frequency of occurrence of these scenarios. in the third step, we calculate the economic losses and environmental taxes. finally, an appropriate maintenance strategy is proposed, taking into account the evaluation results obtained by the previous steps. a case study illustrates the proposed approach and shows that the latter constitutes an important decision support tool to improve the existing maintenance strategy to comply with regulations and standards in term of productivity, reduction of costs and environmental protection.",industrial process,"The problem of decision-making on the planning of maintenance tasks remains at the heart of industrial concerns. Indeed, the impacts of poorly planned maintenance are not limited to production loss, but can also lead to risks to installations, the personnel safety and damage to the environment. For this reason, adopting an appropriate maintenance strategy is essential to prevent a technical failure and its propagation from leading to these effects. This works based on risk analysis for the selection of a better maintenance strategy. The application of the proposed approach to an operational industrial process has shown an optimal allocation of maintenance resources by taking into account the results of the risk analysis. The proposed approach can help in decision making.","khanfri nor el houda,touahar hafed, ouazraoui nouara, simohammed antar and bouabid djamel lrpi laboratory, health and occupational safety institute, university of batna-2, batna, algeria khanfri.safa24@gmail.com,hafedtouahar@gmail.com,n.ouazraoui@univ- batna2.dz,simo.antar@gmail.com, jmlghn@gmail.com sellami ilyas department of applied engineering,kasdi merbah university-ouargla, algeria sellami.ilyas@univ-ouargla.dz",

Skala Maxima Griya Workshop 1. The ANN method is the most appropriate because it has the smallest error value than other methods. The selected aggregate planning is a mixture of Shift and overtime because the costs incurred are the smallest compared to the aggregate Shift and overtime. The total cost incurred was Rp 1,405,321,500.00. The results of the calculation of the RCCP capacity with the CRP are different. The average monthly capacity of the RCCP method is 251.030 minutes, while the CRP calculation results show a smaller average capacity of 226.555 minutes. In contrast, the RCCP method does not take these two things into account. However, there is a difference in the average capacity of the two methods, PT. Skala Maxima Griya is still able to produce the demand for TV cabinets with its resources. After calculating material requirements planning calculated using the MRP method with lot sizing LFL, EOQ, POQ, LUC, AWW, and Silver Meal for ten types of raw materials, the silver meal method was the most suitable to be used because it produced the cheapest total cost of Rp. 17,068,500.00. The savings for this improvement for PT. Skala Maxima Griya Workshop was 74% of the total cost in 2019. Based on the analysis that has been carried out, the cause of excessive raw materials is due to the absence of experts who know and master PPIC knowledge at PT. Skala Maxima Griya. The absence of the expert cause purchases problems with raw materials.","custom production andre jonathan christifan, lina gozali, lamto widodo, frans jusuf daywin, carla olyvia doaly industrial engineering department universitas tarumanagara west jakarta, 11440, indonesia andre.545170002@stu.untar.ac.id, linag@ft.untar.ac.id",

223,The Layout Of Raw Material Warehouse In Pt. Boga  Dimsum Indonesia Using Class-Based Storage Method,"pt. boga dimsum indonesia is a company that engages in non-msg frozen dim sum. the problem identified in the current raw material warehouse is that operators have difficulty finding raw materials and it became mixed up. this problem arises because the operators place the raw material randomly and without specific rules only based on empty positions. this study aims to improve the raw material warehouse layout to be more efficient, minimize displacement time, and reduce material handling costs. the method used to improve the raw material warehouse layout is the class-based storage method and the promodel simulation. this layout design is carried out based on the group of materials, the frequency of material entry and exit, the number of storage places, the distance to move materials, and the raw material warehouse area. the data will be processed using a class-based storage method so that three proposed layouts will be verified and validated using the promodel simulation. the new warehouse layout can increase the efficiency of the raw material's distance movement by 35.29% or 1230.96 m shorter than the initial distance. the material handling cost reduces 33.87% or $ 243.37 cheaper than the initial material handling cost. promodel simulation validated and verified that the new alternative layout could reduce the displacement time by 14% or 38658 seconds faster than the initial time.",layout,"The data processing and analysis results concluded that redesigning the warehouse layout using the class-based storage method can reduce the travel distance and material handling costs of the raw material warehouse. By using the class-based storage method, we obtained three alternative layouts of the raw material warehouse. The third alternative layout selected as the best design with the smallest travel distance and lowest material handling cost from these three alternatives. The third alternative layout has a shorter travel distance of 1230.96 m and a more excellent efficiency value of 35.29% compared to the initial layout's travel distance. Other than that, the third alternative layout has a material handling cost percentage of 33.87% or $ 243.37 cheaper compared to the initial material handling costs. In the end, the promodel simulation will analyze the third alternative. The result is that the third alternative can reduce the material displacement time by 38658 seconds or 14% shorter than the initial layout displacement time. Therefore, this research concluded that the design of an alternative layout using a class- based storage method could reduce the travel distance, material handling costs, and displacement time.","and promodel simulation evelyn adisurya, lina gozali, dan i wayan sukania, frans jusuf daywin, carla olyvia doaly industrial engineering department universitas tarumanagara west jakarta, 11140, indonesia evelyn.545170020@stu.untar.ac.id, linag@ft.untar.ac.id wayans@ft.untar.ac.id",

The calculation of material requirements carried out showed Algoritma Wagner Within has a minimum cost of Rp. 10.633.657.829 for the total raw material cost. Based on the analysis that has been done, there are differences in RCCP and CRP capacity because the CRP method uses the efficiency and utilization of the machine for calculations. The capacity machine problem always affects production. This is happened because of an inaccurate scheduling system. Mixing machines is lack of capacity to fulfill all of the demand. Companies need to pay attention to some machines that have the excess capacity to reduce and replace shifts into overtime because the costs given are smaller, and excessive production results can be reduced.","(case study pt. dynaplast) for industry 4.0 priskila abigail gunawan, lina gozali, lamto widodo, frans jusuf daywin, carla olyvia doaly industrial engineering department universitas tarumanagara west jakarta, 11440, indonesia priskila.545170051@stu.untar.ac.id, linag@ft.untar.ac.id",

Dynaplast Jatake","production scheduling is an important process, especially in manufacturing or service industries, to allocate existing resources to make them more orderly, effective, and efficient. production scheduling can be defined as controlling, managing, and optimizing work in a production process or manufacturing process to get optimal time. the purpose of this study is to minimize the scheduling makespan at pt. dynaplast jatake. the company's actual scheduling has a makespan of 4954.73, which indicates that pt. dynaplast in its production scheduling has not been maximized and is still using the fifo (first in first out) method.the method used in this study is the cds (campbell, dudek and smith algorithm), bat algorithm, and the tabu search algorithm. in the cds algorithm, the job sequence mf-arrow- wendy-zwt-nbe has the smallest makespan of 4119.50 and a mean flow time of 3328.34. meanwhile, in the tabu search algorithm, the job sequences of arrow-mf-wendy-zwt-nbe and mf-arrow-wendy-zwt-nbe have the same makespan value of 4030.89. in the bat algorithm, the smallest makespan is 4620 seconds for the 4th bat in the order of the job arrow - nbe - morning fresh (mf) - zwt- wendy. based on the result, tabu search algorithm is the best method of scheduling for pt. dynaplast. keyword: flowshop scheduling, cds algorithm, bat algorithm, tabu search algorithm 1. introduction the industry is the process of making and processing raw materials into a usable product. there are many challenges faced today to compete with competitors because of the rapid development of the industry. therefore, the industry today must strive for better development. one of the developments that have been done is to make production scheduling more effectively so that sales can be delivered on time and do not suffer losses. pt. dynaplast jatake is a manufacturing company engaged in producing medium to high-quality plastics for various needs such as bottles or other necessities. pt. dynaplast jatake uses quality imported plastic pellets from singapore to make all the bottled products it produces. the problem experienced by this company is implementing manual production scheduling. often, some jobs are prioritized according to the demands of production employees. sometimes, they have not implemented a scheduling system as part of the production system. the limitation of the problem used in this research is that the research was conducted at pt. dynaplast jatake by interview, direct observation, and data collection in the company, focusing on product planning with zwt 300 gr neck snap, wendy 400 ml, morning fresh 400 ml, arrow 500 ml, and nbe 100 ml, the data used were july period data. 2020-august 2020, it is assumed that the machine condition and delivery times are always right. this study aimed to determine the number of actual orders and the number of order planning for each product at pt. dynaplast jatake, knowing the company's production flow and scheduling system used and looking for the total time needed to complete orders at pt. dynaplast jatake, provides the most appropriate engine scheduling design proposal that can minimize the makespan and design an information system that is a simple application program that can help the production department in the scheduling process at pt. dynaplast jatake. 2. literature review 2.1. scheduling scheduling is the sorting of making or working a product as a whole process is done on several machines. (ginting, 2009). scheduling is a theory in which there are fundamental principles, models, techniques, and logical conclusions in the decision-making process that understand the scheduling function. scheduling is an important process, especially in manufacturing or service industries, to allocate existing resources to be more orderly, effective, and efficient. the resources in question can be machines or workers. according to putri lynna a. luthan and syafriandi (2006), the proceedings of the 11th annual international conference on industrial engineering and operations management singapore, march 7-11, 2021 © ieom society international 2733",,"The conclusion of this research is the actual scheduling at PT. Dynaplast Jatake does not have a minimum makespan value, which is 4954.73 seconds. Tabu Search algorithm produces scheduling that can minimize makespan by 4935.72 seconds, which is smaller with the job order is Morning Fresh (MF) - Arrow - Wendy - ZWT – NB. Then, compared to the calculation, the CDS Algorithm is equal to 4935.72 seconds with the same job order as the Tabu Algorithm Search in the order of the job is Morning Fresh (MF) - Arrow - Wendy - ZWT - NBE. In the Bat Algorithm, the smallest makespan is 4620 seconds for the 4th bat in the order of the job is Arrow - NBE - Morning Fresh (MF) - ZWT - Wendy. However, the Bat Algorithm calculation can produce more optimal scheduling because it is very detailed and uses ten bats. There are 300 random values used for each position. Based on manual calculations on the three algorithm methods above, the Bat Algorithm is the best solution for scheduling applications in production scheduling at PT. Dynaplast because it can produce the smallest makespan value.

231,The Design Of Instant Desk Cleaner For Public Facilities  During Pandemic Era,"nowadays, health has become one of the most prioritized aspects of human life. this problem is caused by the outbreak of covid-19 the world currently experiencing that can lead to the death of a person's life. as dangerous as covid-19 symptoms are, it can be prevented by keeping our hygiene clean. however, public facilities' sanitation is not well maintained as fewer staff are working on it due to the pandemic, such as the table around the area. because of this, we create a product called ""instant desk cleaner,"" which is an automated product that at the same time can clean and disinfect a table to prevent the virus from staying on the table and preserving the hygiene of people who are going to use it. we created this product from the survey to find the customer's concern and needs during this pandemic era. moreover, we created four product concepts and narrow them down to the final concept by concept selection. then, we created the 3d image of the product by using autodesk fusion 360 to make a suitable dimension of the product that can fit easily and operates effectively on the table.","wiper, sprayer, joint",,"stiven tjen, theodorus henderson, vanessa angelica budiono, nicolas reynaldo, frans jusuf daywin, lina gozali, lamto widodo, adianto, ahmad, lithrone laricha salomon, agustinus purna irawan department of industrial engineering universitas tarumanagara jakarta, indonesia stiventjen888@gmail.com, theodorus255@gmail.com, laurenciavanessa@gmail.com, nicolasrey168@gmail.com",
232,An Ergonomic Approach To Design Restaurant Dinning,"in this covid-19 pandemic situation, many people were worried and scared when they went outside their house. because they could get infected by this virus, most people choose to stay at home rather than go outside. in indonesia, the government has also made policies by implementing work, school, and college from home; not only that, but they also made policies in managing the culinary business, especially managing a restaurant during the covid-19 pandemic. unfortunately, not all restaurants in indonesia already meet this health protocol; this is the main reason why people choose not to dine in at the restaurant. one way to apply health protocol on restaurant is by making an innovation or redesigning the table. by spread 100 questionnaires to the indonesian society regarding their view of the restaurant around their places and their needs on the restaurant table during this pandemic, we expected it could reduce their worry. keyword: covid-19 pandemic, restaurant, restaurant table 1. introduction the covid-19 pandemic has been running for half a year, and according to worldmeter.info, more than 43 million people have been infected. more than 300 thousand people have been infected with more than 5 thousand cases of people infected every day in indonesia. because of this pandemic situation, the government implemented large-scale social restrictions by prohibiting people from going out without wearing masks. people must keep their distance wherever they are, and decreasing activities outside home such as school, work, and they even set up a visitor limit at the mall, recreation areas, restaurant, etc. based on kompas.com, a restaurant permitted by the government could open for business, but there's a visitor limit. they only allowed 50% of the customer from the space provided. if the restaurant is located in the red zone, they only serve a drive-thru or take away order. because of it, not many people want to dine in the restaurant, not only because of the visitor limit but also because of the restaurant's lack of health protocol equipment. people worried they could become infected by this virus, so they choose to have a meal at home or order some food via an online platform, based on tirto. id there's an increase in online purchases around 38.3% during this pandemic situation. this prohibition made to reduce public worried when dining in a restaurant. product innovation is needed. innovating or redesigning a restaurant table to meet with health protocols, we must pay attention to how this table could keep the distance between customer and waitress more than 1 meter and how it could prevent droplet splashed from to another customer. it could be another way to reduce public worried and suppress the spread of the virus at a restaurant to make another new virus spread cluster. 1.1 objectives this study aims to design a restaurant table that could meet the health protocol and customer expectations to reduce their worry when dining in a restaurant. to design a restaurant table with an ergonomics and anthropometrics approach, we must first know what the customer wants and what the customer needs. by fulfilling their wants and needs, we could design a good restaurant table for this covid-19 pandemic situation. proceedings of the 11th annual international conference on industrial engineering and operations management singapore, march 7-11, 2021 © ieom society international 2785",,,"monica aprillita, cherry atmodjo, michael kartawijaya, nicholas adrian, frans jusuf daywin, lina gozali, lamto widodo, adianto, ahmad, lithrone laricha salomon, agustinus purna irawan department of industrial engineering tarumanagara university jakarta, indonesia monica.545190044@stu.untar.ac.id, cherry.545190059@stu.untar.ac.id, michael.545190039@stu.untar.ac.id, nicholas.545190072@stu.untar.ac.id","References

234,The Integrated Dial-A-Ride-Problem: Fixed Route Selection,"the integrated dial-a-ride problem (idarp) concerns of the optimal routes of a set of vehicles that serve the first and last miles of in combination journeys such that a fixed transport service may carry out the longest part of the journey. it implies some modeling and practical issues. practical wise, it only integrates a single fixed line. it also does not accept any dial-a-ride problem (darp) request. from the modeling perspective, the transfer node system enlarges quickly with each new request. it also requires more strengthening strategies to be adopted. the proposed integrated dial-a-ride problem fixed-route selection (idarp-frs) handles some of these issues. it extends the idarp to include iterations over a two-line fixed service. an additional set of constraints is devised to easily switch the proposed model to the idarp and even accommodate users from the dial-a-ride problem. the idarp-frs also introduces a set of newly constructed direction-based constraints, for controlling the service quality. besides, the symmetry-breaking constraints are brought from the literature to the context of the idarp-frs to further strengthen the model. the computational tests are implemented on gurobi and showed the significant role of the proposed constraints in reducing the problem complexity.","dial-a-ride problem, darp","The IDARP represents an effective formulation for two-mode transport. The IDARP-FRS has effectively extended the IDARP to specify which fixed-line is perfect for which user in terms of operating costs. It also accommodates constraints to allow users to be transported by the IDARP or the regular dial-a-ride problem. A set of newly formed direction-based constraints are presented. The role of these constraints in suppressing the number of transfer nodes related arcs is proved. Moreover, the IDARP-FRS comprises the symmetry-breaking constraints which has a potential in strengthening the model. The IDARP-FRS is a rich problem that needs future research to be extended with the inclusion of numerous real-life scenarios. However, the utmost attention should be paid to advancing the transfer nodes’ structure so that bigger instances can be solved within a reasonable time.","sabreen hassan, islam ali, and m. nashat fors industrial engineering, alexandria university, alexandria, egypt eng-sabreen.hassan@alexu.edu.eg, islam.ali@alexu.edu.eg, nashat.fors@alexu.edu.eg",
235,Design Of Working Shelf And Design Of  Layouts On The Working Table With,"in this modern age, where information, communication, and technology are developing rapidly, the food & beverage industry began to appear one by one, seeing this phenomenon as a promising business opportunity. haiso coffee is an example of a business in this food & beverage industry that focuses on the coffee-based drink that has recently started its business in the retail world. the problems that can be seen during the observation are the working table that still looks not tidy and neat and the worktable is not high enough, seen from the barista posture. therefore, the research intends to design a tool that can help fix haiso coffee. the working table's design is adjusted according to the needs that haiso coffee required the matrix of needs and interests, which is based on data collected from interviews. the working table has designed a thick base to adjust an ergonomic working table's height with several additional functions. the first shelf functions as a storage and placing several machines and materials on the working table. the second one is for the showcase, which serves as a display for several haiso coffee products. keyword: product design, layout, arc, ard, aad ergonomics, rula. 1. introduction the development of technology created by the humans is a dynamic process and will always evolve. the impact of current technological developments has led to the emergence of many industries in the f&b (food and beverage) sector, especially the ""trendy"" beverage. haiso coffee is a newcomer to the f&b industry business, which focuses on selling coffee-based beverages in the west jakarta area. this company has three work stations in producing the various menus they offer. the three work stations are a food station, an expresso base station, and a manual brew station. after conducting brief observations and observations at haiso coffee, a problem was found at the manual brew station one of its work stations. the problems were found on the working table, where the workbench conditions were not well-structured, where the equipment and materials on the production table were simply exposed on the table, and there was no proper barrier between producers and consumers. the divider is only the working table itself. it is necessary to fix this problem; a working table is needed that is useful as a position regulator and layout of machine and materials on the working table and a barrier between consumers and producers. there is also, the purpose of this research being carried out is to design the layout of the facilities (equipment and materials) on the working table. the design uses arc (activity relation chart), ard (activity relation diagram), and aad (activity allocation diagram) as a basis for layout design. the layout results from the design will be applied to the design tools to be designed. 2. literature review 2.1. product design and development product design and development is an activity that begins with the analysis of market opportunities and perceptions and ends with the manufacturing, sales, and delivery stages of the product. besides, product design and development can also be interpreted as a sequence of activities or steps in which a group tries to compile, design, and market a product [1]. the product development process is a sequence of steps for converting a set of inputs into a set of outputs. the product development process is a sequence of steps or activities in which a company seeks to organize, design, proceedings of the 11th annual international conference on industrial engineering and operations management singapore, march 7-11, 2021 © ieom society international 2820",,,"ergonomic analysis in haiso coffee fernando valentino1, frans jusuf daywin2, adianto3, lina gozali4, carla olyvia doaly5 agustinus purna irawan6 1.2.3,4.5industrial engineering department 6mechanical engineering department universitas tarumanagara jakarta, indonesia 11440 e-mail: fernando.545160021@stu.untar.ac.id1, fransjusuf42@gmail.com2, adianto@ft.untar.ac.id3, linag@ft.untar.ac.id4, carlaol@ft.untar.ac.id5","References

236,Challenges And Barriers To Women In The Uk Construction  Industry,"this paper raises various challenges and barriers faced by women in uk construction industry. women working in construction industry are observed to be very low when compared to men. it was observed that currently women work force in construction sector is less than 15%, of which most of them are observed to be working in planning and office based jobs. this paper discusses about various barriers and challenges faced by current women in construction sector focusing on uk. various issues and barriers faced by women have been debated. lack of awareness to join construction industry is also being one of the major barrier. from the research study, it was observed that women working are mostly into non- technical skills but it is because of difficulty to balance work life balance due to lack of flexible work hours. lack of these will not let women balance between family needs and fruitful career. this study helped to focus and work towards various recommendations which help to improve work atmosphere. these suggestions help for better women retention and contribution in construction sector which is known to be male dominated sector. few of them being creating better training towards equality, creating awareness at young age and encouraging to enter construction industry. recruiting more women also encourages towards a better women employment rate.","women, barriers, challenges, commitments, safety","This study revealed that there is scarcity of women in UK construction industry, this supports the statement that UK construction industry is male dominated. Majority women are featured to be working in architecture and administration departments which are mostly office based jobs. On site, it was observed that majority of the women hired on site are labors was observed that women were absent in craft trade and site engineer and management. Women training towards better position is absent from past which are causing under performance of women in different job roles within construction industry. Construction firm’s recruitment guidelines are based on employees work experience and women tend to face issues as the company expect employees who can take up various tasks involving physical effort and long work hours in different weather conditions and other varied. uncomfortable and unhygienic conditions. When compared to men, it is considered that women’s work efficiency in outdoor events is low but on the other hand female employees don’t accept it as they believe that they can work equally with men in all conditions. Design related works such as architects, planning, designing fields are best considered for women and other job roles like estimating, cost management, quantity surveyor which are mostly related to intellect. Women in UK construction sector are comparatively on far better side when compared to other developing countries. Need to establish more jobs for women in construction sector. Need for better conditions on site are very much required. Safety equipment and vests should be well fitted which is the major concern among women. Males outnumber women in overall number of jobs. There is vast improvement and betterment in women job opportunities compare to previous days.","abdussalam shibani*; messaoud saidani; dyaa hassan; araz agha school of energy, construction and environment coventry university, coventry, cv1 5fb, uk. *corresponding author. ab1732@coventry.ac.uk marwa alghodi faculty of science and engineering university of wolverhampton, wv1 1ly, uk m.alghodi@ wlv.ac.uk noof alawanati construction management with bim nawal gherbal, engineering and knowledge management mohamed abduelmula mohamed3.abduelmula@northumbria.ac.uk northumbria university",
237,Benefits And Challenges Of Implementing Six Sigma   “As A Process Improvement Management Strategy”,"six sigma has long been deemed a quality initiative in the construction industry. there exists a limited use of six sigma within the uk construction industry and there are many reasons for this. primarily there seems to be a misconception about the capabilities of six sigma in construction-specific context. very little research has been done for six-sigma as a process improvement initiative for construction. therefore, in this dissertation, the capability of six sigma to be used as a process improvement management strategy within the uk construction industry is explored in order to better propagate this method and increase its use within the industry. the current stance of six sigma within construction context is explored, drawing out the benefits and challenges of using its principles, further explaining why the uk’s construction industry lacks its application. after a detailed literature review, two case studies are presented of uk construction projects and companies which used six sigma to enhance process performance. the case studies were critically analysed to draw out the benefits and the challenges experienced in order to finally provide recommendations which will encourage the industry, whether in research or in practice to further make use of six sigma as a process performance enhancer.","uk, six sigma, case studies",,"abdussalam shibani*; hussein chahine; messaoud saidani; dyaa hassan; araz agha school of energy, construction and environment coventry university, coventry, cv1 5fb, uk. *corresponding author. ab1732@coventry.ac.uk marwa alghodi faculty of science and engineering university of wolverhampton, wv1 1ly, uk m.alghodi@ wlv.ac.uk nawal gherbal, engineering and knowledge management mohamed abduelmula mohamed3.abduelmula@northumbria.ac.uk northumbria university","References

239,The Effectiveness Of Using Modern Construction Methods As  A Solution To Assist The Social Housing Shortage In The,"the shortage of social housing is on the rise and there is an urgent need for houses in recent days to fulfil uk’s need. there are many complications regarding this issue and some of them being is to save time and money and build good quality units. year in and year out the uk can’t seem to achieve their target to fulfil the large demand. the british method of building homes is the traditional method which is brick, block and cavity, which can be expensive and a lengthy process. this research is on mmc (modern method of construction) and how these modern methods can solve this ongoing problem. these modern methods can be volumetric, panelized, hybrid and site based system, these methods can be used as individuals or as a team. the author has used the factual documentation to prove that modern method of construction can have a great input in solving this problem. the methodology which the author has used is the mixed method where he obtained the valuable data from secondary research, primary research, interviews, survey questionnaires and case studies. the author started with the secondary source where he reviewed journals, articles, books, reports and case studies and one he gained enough knowledge he moved on to obtain primary data which he found the most important and valuable data by interviewing professional from housing development (senior project manager and ceo of the company). on the other hand, he also handed out a minimum of 50 survey questionnaires to the professional of housing construction industry containing participants from senior to a junior level including labourers as well, where mixed views were received mostly in the favour of the modern method of construction as some participants were not aware or heard of mmc. the author also included a comparison of construction methods, such as comparing british traditional method to modular and breeam. lastly, the author came to a conclusion upon all the facts and statistics he obtained from throughout his research, he also added the recommendations and the scope of further studies, as this study would prove to provide great benefits to the future researcher in the field study of modern method of construction.","uk, shortage, march 7-11","Modern Method of Constructions is still fairly a new method and this method only started getting used only a few years ago to minimize cost and time and to help the environment. The researcher will highlight all the important aspects in this chapter, also run through a recap to freshen up the reader’s memory again. This chapter has a lot of importance whole as it plays the backbone of this research, as this is the moment of truth and waits to see how accurate were the hypothesis, discuss all the noteworthy topics and recommendations and further research and further work. The project title is on MMC (Modern method of construction), which involves new construction methods that can save a vast amount of time and speeds up the process. (Hiremath 2017) This research will highlight how MMC can play its part to get the UK out of the social housing crisis. MMC can be in a form of a volumetric, panelised, hybrid or site-based construction. One of the issues which Britain has been facing for many years until this present day, which is the shortage of social housing in the UK. From past number of years this problem has not been solved, as the target set for every year has not seemed to be attainable. In the UK the usage of MMC is very little compare to the other countries, such as China where 57-storey building can be constructed in just little as 19 days (Guardion 2015). But the question is by obtaining this method can the UK solve this problem. Reintroduction to the Methodology In this research, the researcher is in favour of the mixed method as he includes qualitative and quantitative research methods. Within this mixed method, it also includes experiments, survey research, participant observation, and secondary data. Quantitative methods aim to classify features, by counting them and creating a statistical model to test hypotheses and to explain observations from gathering all the information. One the hand, qualitative methods are seen to be the opposite as the aim is for a complete, detailed description of observations and interviews, for example, the context of events and circumstances within the research method.","united kingdom abdussalam shibani*; araz agha; messaoud saidani; dyaa hassan; umar bari school of energy, construction and environment coventry university, coventry, cv1 5fb, uk. *corresponding author. ab4146@coventry.ac.uk and ab1732@coventry.ac.uk nawal gherbal, engineering and knowledge management mohamed abduelmula mohamed3.abduelmula@northumbria.ac.uk northumbria university",

242,A Novel On-Line Surface Roughness Measuring Method,"surface finish evaluation would help in the functional prediction of components. many of the techniques used in the surface finish assessment are contact in nature. to do away with the limitations of contact techniques, non-contact techniques came in. these non-contact approaches used electro optical principles. many of the non-contact approaches are not industry-friendly. many of these techniques had limited applications in sampling inspection. sampling inspection of components use statistical techniques and are not fool-proof. there are chances of defective components reaching the customer. this will not only make the customer un happy but also creates bad reputation of company in front of the customer. nowadays, the thrust is towards 100% inspection. this is because, only 100% inspection will ensure quality products reaching the customer. this will make customer happy and will enhance the company’s reputation. in this context, the present method assumes special significance. in the current research work, an effort has been made to develop a novel non-contact method for surface finish assessment. the method finds application in the automated, non-contact and on-line inspection of automobile and aircraft components.",on-line inspection,"In the current research work, specimens are produced by different manufacturing processes viz. shaping, milling and grinding, are used for surface roughness measurement. The roughness of these specimens were measured using the stylus instruments. As the roughness readings obtained by the stylus instruments are considered as standard for all practical purposes. In the current research work, stylus measured roughness readings are used for validating the roughness measurement readings obtained by vision method. The vision system used in this research work uses a CCD camera for acquiring the surface images. The experimental setup uses a frame grabber for getting a digital image. In the current research the test surface was illuminated by a Helium-Neon laser and a speckle pattern was grabbed. By rotating the table by a small angle another speckle pattern was captured for the same test surface. The software developed using C++ installed in the vision system, is used for getting the correlation speckle pattern. From the experimental results, it was observed that the visibility of correlation speckle patterns was improved with the decrease in surface roughness of the specimens. Experiments were conducted at different grazing angles of incidence. It was found that as the grazing angle increases, the visibility of the correlation speckle pattern decreases. This has led to the conclusion that for better accuracies of roughness measurements smaller grazing values will have to be used. This is true for shaped, milled and ground surfaces. A very good correlation between roughness readings was observed (Figure 7), between the vision method and the stylus method (Figure 6) for milling, shaping, and ground surfaces. The accuracy of measurement was good (Table 4). The proposed method of measurement cannot be used for inspecting very smooth or very rough surfaces. The proposed method has very good repeatability of measurements. The method presented in this research work can be used in the online inspection of medium to rough surfaces (4 μms to 30 μms). The method finds application in the automobile and aircraft industries. Surface roughness measurement range can be greatly improved by having very low grazing angles.

Lean projects (5S, Kanban, SMED, TPM), are executed for meeting the targets set in the future state map. After implementing the 5S project in the manufacturing line has resulted in 100% cleanliness than before. The project also helped in reducing the searching time for jigs, tools, and fixtures. Also, the project made a significant contribution to reducing inspection time (30%-40%). The project has also eliminated the unnecessary movement of operators. This has also resulted in improved communication quality and operators became productive. This has resulted in improved job satisfaction. Through, work standardization, TPM, and the introduction of the electronic messaging system, product quality (0% defective) improved. Kanban and supermarkets have made the entire manufacturing line pull- based. With the new arrangement, raw material inventory was reduced from three months to a one-week inventory. Also, work-in-process inventory is eliminated. Thus, the manufacturing line became lean and flexible. By using appropriate fixtures set-up time (30%-50%) is reduced. Through, SMED project, change-over-time (50%- 75%) is reduced. With the introduction of TPM and making the operator responsible for maintaining his machine, machine uptime, or availability (100%-120%) is increased. This has made meeting the production targets easy and thereby making the customer happy. The success of lean projects is possible only through the active involvement of all the concerned people. Top management support is very much required in all stages of a lean project. By executing lean projects has also made the workers safe (100%), productive, and highly motivated.

249,Using Latin Hypercube Hammersley Sampling Method For  Algorithm Parameter Tuning: A Case For Differential Ant-,"metaheuristic methods have many design parameters, and fine-tuning of that parameters can improve these algorithms performance. in this paper, a sampling based algorithm configuration approach is proposed and applied it to the differential ant-stigmergy algorithm (dasa)’s five control parameters. performance of a large parameter set of dasa, obtained by latin hypercube hammersley sampling (lhhs) method, used to solve the sphere function and compared it with another tuned version. the results of our experiment demonstrated that lhhs method found better performing configurations than the default parameter value of the dasa and also than another proposed tuned version dasa*. and the results demonstrated that three parameter configurations obtained with lhhs found better result than the best configuration obtained with sobol sequence sampling method (dasa*) for function dimension 20, and five parameter configuration for function dimension 40. according to the results, it can be said that usage of lhhs for initialization of other state-of-art algorithm configuration methods instead of other sampling methods is worth investigating.",meta heuristics,"and Discussion Fine- tuning of metaheuristic algorithms parameter values can improve its ability to solve the optimization problem. For this purpose we focused on the problem of tuning the Differential Ant-Stigmergy Algorithm’s (five) control parameters. In our study, we evaluated DASA algorithm performance tuned with LHHS method for the Sphere function on two problem dimensions (20 and 40). In this study we compared the performance of LHHS sampled parameter set and Sobol sampled parameter set for tuning the parameters of DASA algorithm. The results of experiment demonstrated the success of LHHS method over Sobol Sequence Sampling method. According to these results, t-DASA (DASA algorithm tuned with LHHS method) demonstrated a better performance than DASA* and DASA. For function dimension 20 there are three parameter vector that solves the problem better than DASA and DASA* and again there are five parameter vector that solves better than others for dimension 40.

250,A Literature Survey On Instance Specific Algorithm  Configuration Methods,"metaheuristics have many parameters fine tuning that parameter values can improve efficiency and effectiveness of these algorithms when solving optimization problems. a considerable number of automated parameter tuning methods have been developed in the last few years. recently developed instance-specific parameter tuning strategies (ipts) considers the interaction between measurable test problem features and algorithm-specific parameter values when developing a tuning strategy. although algorithm configuration has a very wide literature, there are rather few studies suggested on instance-specific parameter tuning and there is not a comprehensive literature survey on this field. in this study we will first give a definition of the algorithm configuration problem and will give an overview about open access studies in the field of ipts. we will survey the proposed methods on this topic and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of these methods as a conclusion in this study. this is first study that surveys the proposed methods in the field of instance-specific parameter tuning strategies.",,"in this study. As author knowledge, this is first study that surveys the proposed methods in the field of Instance-specific Parameter Tuning Strategies As a summary;  It can be said that IPTS takes advantages of parameter control and parameter tuning methods (Ries et al, 2013).  Ries and Beullens (2015) sorted the difficulties of IPTS such as; the selection of instance characteristics, assessing the relation between the parameter values of the algorithm, the instance-specific information, and their impact on algorithm performance.  Furthermore developing effective instance-specific algorithm configuration methods encourage the developers for highly parametrize their algorithms for foremost NP-hard problems such as planning and MIP. For further research there are some recommendations such as;  Instance-Specific Parameter Tuning methods are effective strategies for solving parameter tuning problem, but more researches must be conducted since the number of studies in this field is rather few.  One of the important part of developing an IPTS is feature selection of instances. Besides using a single generic feature, Lau and Lo (2011) suggested to combine various fitness landscape features, such as density of local optima. Different generic features that enables to generate clusters from population-based- algorithm can be investigated (Lindawati et al., 2013).  Assessment of performance metric and clustering method is another important step of developing an efficient IPTS method. Effect of distinct performance measures and distinct clustering techniques on the performance can be investigated (Lau and Lo, 2011).  Lau and Lo (2011) suggested to investigate if integrating adaptive methods (in which the parameter values are changed based on the target algorithm’s behavior during its run) will improve the instance-based configurator’s performance.  Different state-of-art algorithm configuration methods (i.e., model-based methods) can be used to strengthen the existing IPTS methods.","yasemin eryoldaş* and alptekin durmuşoğlu department of industrial engineering gaziantep university, turkey *corresponding author. yaseminsirin87@windowslive.com.tr, durmusoglu@gantep.edu.tr",
251,Reliability Centered Maintenance Of Circular Loom,"today’s customers demand not only product variety but also expect quick delivery of products. in order to meet these challenges from customers, manufacturing companies will have to ensure timely availability of raw materials, cutting tools, machine tools, people etc. thus, availability of machine tools is one important factor that determines whether the customer’s demand can be met by the manufacturing company or not. availability of machines means machine should be available whenever its service is required. in order to increase the machine availability or machine uptime, maintenance is done. thus, maintenance would help in extending the useful service life of the machine tools. in industries, maintenance of certain machine tools is done at regular intervals. this type of maintenance is known as preventive maintenance. for certain machine tools, maintenance will be done after the breakdown of machine tool. this type of maintenance is called breakdown maintenance. the main constraint faced by many manufacturing companies is that there is a limitation on the maintenance budget. this has made many manufacturing companies start thinking in new ways for solving maintenance problem. in this context, reliability centered maintenance (rcm) assumes special significance. the objective of rcm is to bring down the maintenance cost. rcm, while focusing is on system’s functionality, will also help in achieving safety aspect and reliability aspect of the system. expert choice software is employed for ahp computation. the application of rcm technique in the maintenance of circular loom is not reported in literature. in this context the current research assumes special significance. research findings presented in this paper are going to help both academicians and researchers.","reliability, maintenance, anp","Maintenance (preventive/reactive) helps in extending the useful life of the machine tools in a manufacturing company. In the present research work, a circular loom in a textile company is considered as a case study. An effort is made to apply the analytical hierarchy process for selecting the appropriate policy for maintaining the different components of a circular loom. Enhancing the availability will ensure meeting customer orders. A circular loom consisted of different components. In the textile company (case study), budget of maintenance was limited. Thus, it was not possible to focus on all the components of circular loom for enhancing the availability of the circular loom. In this context critical components had to be identified for reducing the maintenance cost. For identifying Analytical hierarchy process (AHP) makes it possible to assign weights to multiple alternatives. Thus, it helps in selecting or classifying alternatives. The technique helps in calculating the weights for different decisions. The technique makes use of expert’s experience in quantifying weights of various decisions through pairwise comparisons. After conducting interviews with experts and based on their feedback, the following criteria clusters are identified: (1) Cost cluster -A component is considered critical if it has higher maintenance cost in comparison to other components; (2) Complexity cluster -A machine with large number of components with high failure rates is considered more critical; (3) Maintainability cluster -A machine with large downtime is considered more critical than others; and (4) Safety cluster -It is important to consider the safety aspect while identifying components which are critical to the functioning of a module. Pair wise comparisons have showed the relative importance of each component with respect other components. Overall importance and the criticality analysis showed that certain components -shutter, electric cutter, swing lever and deflector pulley are critical for the effective functioning of the circular loom. As these components are critical and since the availability of the circular loom depends on these components, preventive maintenance policy is preferred over breakdown maintenance. Certain components e.g., reed ring had scored less criticality rating. Thus, reed ring is not considered as a critical component of the circular loom. Also, breakdown maintenance is preferred. The current research work showed that not all components require same type of maintenance policies. Thus, by focussing only on critical components of circular loom, there will be a reduction of total maintenance cost.

255,Productivity Assessment Studies In Solenoid Valve  Manufacturing Company – A Case Study,"lean organizations have dual advantages of increased flexibility and increased response time. due this reason, many industries the world over have been transitioning themselves to become lean. an effort has been made in this article to present how by using the value stream mapping (vsm) tool different forms of waste can be identified, methodically, in a solenoid valve manufacturing company and also how it has helped in improving the productivity of the organization. in this article, the current value stream map (cs map) is drawn for the manufacturing line. the current value stream map shows the different forms of wastes in the production line. the value stream map also shows the production lead time. the cs map is then evaluated and the future value stream is then proposed.",lean system,"Current research work considers a solenoid valve manufacturing company as a case study. An attempt is made in this work to construct a VSM for the CS of the production line of the company. Value stream map is constructed after collecting all relevant data such as cycle time, machine uptime, changeover time, defect rates, information flow between operators and supervisors, work in process, raw- material- inventory, and finished- goods- inventory. After constructing the current state map, different types of waste were identified in the manufacturing line. After evaluating the current state map an attempt is made to propose a future state map for the same manufacturing line. It is seen that the productivity of the line is enhanced. Also, the line became very flexible. Improvements after lean implementation are: Wire cutting and tinning process: 16% reduction in cycle time; Pin insertion process: 42% reduction in cycle time Winding process: 16% reduction in cycle time; Welding process: 23% reduction in cycle time; Soldering Process: 30% reduction in cycle time; Insert assembly: 76% reduction in cycle time; Crimping and heat shrinking of sleeve process: 65% reduction in cycle time; Laser marking process: 57% reduction in cycle time. Also, Table 1 shows the reduction in changeover time achieved for different processes of the manufacturing line. The average change over time reduction achieved for the entire manufacturing line is 28%. With the introduction of Kanban and the supermarket scheme, the WIP, raw material, and finished goods inventory were reduced. Also, from figure 2, it is evident that the VAT is reduced from 637 seconds to 260 seconds. Also, the non-value-added time in the manufacturing line is reduced from 12 days (Current state) to 4 days (Future state). This indeed is a significant reduction. Productivity improvement is a journey and not a destination.

256,Stakeholder Management Models For Solid Waste  Management Projects,"the solid waste generation is a pressing issue in the global context because of the environmental pollution, limited choices to dispose solid waste properly and the lack of contribution from the stake holders. in the sri lankan context, landfills are still considered the most feasible method of managing solid waste. most of the newly proposed waste management site construction projects face public oppression which makes it difficult to effectively execute the construction of those projects and implement them. therefore, the need of a well research stakeholder conflict resolution procedure is often observed. three stakeholder management models have been short listed and discussed in this paper as a part of selecting a model to conflict resolution. a systematic literature review is conducted using indexed journal and conference papers to identify stakeholders of solid waste management projects. the government, local authorities, neighboring community, public, environmental activists and media has been identified as key stakeholders. in government funded public projects a significant power resides in the government as the client. power versus interest grid is selected as the most suitable stakeholder management model because it addresses the conflict of power in deciding location and facility route, validity of compensation system and procedure and necessity of solid waste management projects.",stakeholders,"The key objectives of this paper are identifying the stakeholders of SWM projects and selecting a suitable SMM to manage the conflicts that may arise among the stakeholders. The stakeholder’s identification was done through and extensive literature review, using 80 journal and conference papers. The government, relevant local authorities and the neighborhood community have been identified in majority of the researches who have a significant interest in the SWM projects. The unavailability of proper strategy to manage the stakeholders were evident through the literature review. Therefore, as a part of fulfilling the objective of selecting a suitable stakeholder management model to address this, three stakeholder management models are selected and reviewed. As concluded through Table 01, the issues of conflicts in SWM projects, have a nature of conflicted power and interest. Procedure of selecting location and facility route, validity of compensation system and procedure necessity of project are issues that might result in a conflict due to the inconsistencies in power of the client and the interest of the community. Therefore, when considering the nature of the potential conflicts the power interest grid could be used as a stakeholder management model. Moreover, the findings presented in Table 2 outline that the power-interest grid demonstrates more positive characteristics of the stakeholder management models than other models. The reasons for the public oppression could identified and addressed using the selected SMM. The limitations of the selected SMM is that they do not outline the stakeholder relationship and it does not reflect the feedback of the stakeholders on the conflict resolution proposition. The power –interest grid serves as a tool to analyze stakeholders and apply suitable strategies to manage them effectively. 6.

257,Optimization Using Decisions Tree And Linear  Programming,"this study aims to optimize profit and satisfy the customer by meeting the schedule of a company that having fierce competition of selling furniture in to global market. in operating their production, the company has been faced by many obstacles, first, they need to decide which combination of products they should have, whether they must allocate their resources to produce common products, custom products, or combination of them. common products only have 30% profit margin but need few numbers of human resources and less time to produce. meanwhile, custom products have a 65% profit margin, but they need many more skillful human resources, trial and error, and longer time to produce. using past data, we model the problem in to decision analysis and then continue with linear programming and sensitivity analysis. the results show that the company will gain 25% increase in net profit and 100% meeting the production and delivery schedule.","global market, competition, optimize profit, decision analysis",", if PT. GMS wants to increase its production or to grow bigger, the first thing they need to increase its woods supply. Using the old production plan method, each month will generate the total of 16.093 USD. However, the Linear Programming yields that, if the company only produce 600 common products, each month they can generate 18.661,5 USD (37.323 USD/2). So, the company can get 2.568 USD additional profit. The Linear Programming Result is 37.323 USD, however, due to the increasing quantity of products should be produced, PT.

259,"The Mediating Role Of Universities Environment In The  Relationship Between Self-Efficacy, Family Environment","in today's world development, entrepreneurial education has a vital role besides functioning to improve life quality—productivity expected to reduce the number of unemployed in indonesia. one solution to solve these conditions is to develop an entrepreneurial culture. thus, the younger generation, e.g. students, can change their mindset from job seekers to job creator. most educated young people tend to avoid this choice and even think as entrepreneurs, as they prefer to work in the company. one of the reasons is that they dare not take up risky jobs and desire to work as employees with a fixed salary every month. this paradigm has ingrained in most indonesians who wish to work in an office. entrepreneurship is the ability to create a business and instil an entrepreneurial spirit for students. this study investigates the role of self-efficacy, family environment and universities toward entrepreneurial intention among students in indonesia context. the design of this study is a quantitative approach through a self- administered questionnaire. a total of 150 undergraduate students have participated in this study and collected by using a convenience sampling technique. this study used universities environment as a mediating variable and analysed using structural equation modelling through partial least square (sem- pls). this study found that self-efficacy and family environment have a significant positive relationship on entrepreneurial intention. we also found that universities' environment does not mediate the proceedings of the 11th annual international conference on industrial engineering and operations management singapore, march 7-11, 2021 © ieom society international 3081",,"In conclusion, the self-efficacy and family environment have a significant positive relationship on entrepreneurial intention. Unfortunately, the universities' environment does not mediate the relationship between self-efficacy and family environment on entrepreneurial intention among Indonesia students. In conclusion, this study indicated that universities environment does not play a mediating role in influencing the entrepreneurial intention. Also, the family environment is a determinant factor in this investigation. In line with this study's findings, we suggest the universities pay attention to developing students' self-efficacy and creating an excellent universities environment to increase entrepreneurial intention among undergraduate students.","and entrepreneurial intention bob foster faculty of economic and business universitas informatika dan bisnis indonesia bandung, jawa barat 40285, indonesia bobriset@unibi.ac.id jumadil saputra and zikri muhammad faculty of business, economics and social development universiti malaysia terengganu 21030 kuala nerus, terengganu, malaysia jumadil.saputra@umt.edu.my, zikri@umt.edu.my muhamad deni johansyah, sukono department of mathematics, faculty of mathematics and natural sciences universitas padjadjaran jatinangor 45363, bandung, indonesia muhamad.deni@unpad.ac.id, sukono@unpad.ac.id abdul talib bon department of production and operations universiti tun hussein onn malaysia 86400 parit raja, johor malaysia talibon@gmail.com",

261,Supply Chain Risk Management Strategies In The Face Of  Covid-19,"the covid-19 pandemic devastated businesses worldwide and the global economy contracted as companies grappled with shocks to demand and supply. the purpose of this research is to understand the impact of covid-19 in industries, identify risk management strategies employed by companies, and recommend methods businesses may consider in selecting suitable strategies to combat future pandemic risks. ten companies across five industries globally were studied, from which eleven distinct strategies in managing covid-19 disruptions were identified. our results suggest that there was no universal risk management strategy against covid-19 that could have been employed by any company, nor was there a strategy unique to a single industry. it was observed that each company employed more than one strategy towards the covid-19 pandemic disruption, but establishing partnerships was the most frequently employed strategy. finally, we propose two contingency and typology frameworks, namely the shock-responsiveness framework and effort-impact framework, to aid companies in determining suitable types of risk management strategies to minimise the impact of future pandemic risks.","covid-19, pandemic risk","The COVID-19 pandemic impacted companies worldwide through a combination of demand and supply shocks (del Rio-Chanona et al., 2020), hampering economic growth while devastating companies’ performances. However, many companies overcame disruptions by employing proactive and reactive supply chain risk management strategies to sustain their businesses. This research offered perspectives and insights from five industries, based on a comparative case approach (Bartlett and Vavrus, 2016). This paper has identified eleven strategies that companies across a broad spectrum had employed to fortify their supply chains prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic. The strategies have been classified under SCR and SCRM, which can be generalised to refer to “proactive” and “reactive” strategies respectively. This study has contributed to the body of research on COVID-19 risk management by developing two contingency and typology frameworks – the Shock-Responsiveness and Effort-Impact Frameworks – to aid companies in determining suitable types of risk management strategies to minimise the impact of pandemic risks. We thus follow the call of DuHadway et al. (2017) on the need to create a framework segregating the risk at different stages around the risk event. At the time of writing, the COVID-19 pandemic was still ongoing. As a result, it is as yet difficult to fully determine the effectiveness of each strategy identified in this study until more time has passed. Moreover, this study has not studied post-pandemic recovery strategies that companies can employ. Thus, future studies may seek to further examine recovery strategies and evaluate the effectiveness of these strategies to enhance the current knowledge of supply chain risk management in preparation for future pandemics.","jia yi woong and shao hung goh school of business singapore university of social sciences singapore jywoong001@suss.edu.sg, shgoh015@suss.edu.sg",

265,Assessment Of The Current Working Condition Of The Garment  Workers And Determining The Importance Of Labor Union For,"the well-being of the workers is one of the most important issues in industries worldwide. the ready-made garment (rmg) industry of bangladesh is the backbone of the country's economy which has been facing challenges to ensure workplace safety of the workers. also, there has not been a healthy growth of labor unionism within the rmg industry. previous studies suggest that there is a widespread occupational segregation and gender discrimination in wage rates. the purpose of this study is to assess the current working condition of the garment workers in terms of health and workplace safety and gender discrimination. another purpose is to determine the impact of labor union on improvement of the workers' condition. the study uses survey data from 203 responses to evaluate the working condition of the rmg industry. an exploratory data analysis was done to measure the occupational health and safety which was followed by a logistic regression to find out the relation between labor union and other variables. results reveal that gender discrimination has been reduced greatly, fire, building and other workplace safety measures has been consistently improving and labor union has a significant impact on enhancement of betterment of the workers.","working condition, labor rights","The above study portrays that the labor laws are still violated in the small size factories, although the overall working condition of the country's RMG industry has seen a tremendous amelioration. The implementation of the labor law by the government, regulations by the Accord and the Alliance and the ILO conventions in the RMG industry of Bangladesh has significantly improved the workplace condition in terms of gender discrimination and, health and safety of the workers. However there are few areas where further attention is required. Since it is proven that labor union has a positive impact on improving the condition of the workers, the government must be diligent in implementing the labour laws to establish labor unions in each and every factory. The employers must use all the facilities provided by the government for the betterment of the female labor force. This research is not free of limitations. One of which is sampling limitation. Only 203 responses do not represent a perfect picture of the whole country. Also, a convenience sampling technique was chosen because of shortages in research resources. Respondents were asked simple Yes/No questions which do not always make a good survey.

266,Does The Procedural Justice Affect Turnover Intention Of  Academic Staff In Malaysian Research Universities?,"academic staff are critical components of any effective teaching-learning process. several researchers have identified the phenomena of academic’s staff, leaving their profession because of many reasons. but why this topic has been more relevant than it used to be, and why it is part of its strategy to remain so. this problem is getting more complicated because it involves the personal, institutional and social aspects of society. it is widely accepted that if the academic staff perceived fairness during the decision-making process, they can fulfil the educational objectives and national goals. academic staff who feel unfairly treated tend to leave the organisation. several types of research have shown that turnover intention has to do with procedural justice. the purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between procedural justice and academic staff of malaysian research universities with turnover intention. this study’s design is quantitative through the cross-sectional approach. also, the samples obtained via questionnaires from university personnel of five public research universities. a total of 277 university staff completed the surveys. the result showed that the purpose of turnover between the lectures was negatively affected by procedural justice. thus, we concluded that procedural justice was an even better predictor of turnover. it means that the university of research in malaysia would understand that their decision to leave will be motivated by a lack of justice.","turnover intention, 2011, zeffane & melhem, 2017",,"noor azlina yusoff, mohd yusoff yusliza, jumadil saputra, zikri muhammad faculty of business, economics and social development universiti malaysia terengganu 21030 kuala nerus, terengganu, malaysia nay@usm.my, yusliza@umt.edu.my, jumadil.saputra@umt.edu.my, zikri@umt.edu.my",

This research explored the most possible terms, which are normally included in the commercial quotation. It gives the user an idea that cost objectives are not necessarily affect the decision whereas there are other objectives may have more priority or must be addressed more than the purchasing cost and it depends on the site situation as well as the occupant satisfaction. Factory A has the highest weighted score, which is resulted from all the matrices, which are done using spreadsheet.

270,Aisle-To-Aisle Design For Sbs/Rs Under Smart Deadlock  Control Policies,"recent increase in e-commerce, warehouse operations have become one of the most significant issues. recent customer profile requests fast delivery time with flexible options in purchasing. automated warehousing technologies are widely utilized in warehouses to provide fast solutions for those demand profiles. shuttle-based storage and retrieval system (sbs/rs) is an automated warehousing technology assuring fast transaction process in warehouses. in this work, we study a special design for sbs/rs where automated vehicles (i.e., shuttles) are more flexible in their travel pattern so that the system would not require a dedicated shuttle in each tier resulting with decreased number of shuttles compared to a dedicated one (i.e., each zone with a single shuttle) in the system. we compare these two system designs, flexible and dedicated ones, by using an agent-based simulation modelling approach. the proposed flexible design is developed on deadlock and collision prevention algorithms evaluating real time information. the performance of the system is compared by their average flow time per transaction, maximum flow time of a transaction, throughput rate and utilization of shuttles, etc. the results show that by integrating smart collision and deadlock prevention algorithms, the proposed flexible aisle-to-aisle sbs/rs works better than the dedicated system design.",cost reduction,"In this work, we propose a novel aisle-to-aisle SBS/RS design where multiple shuttles can travel between aisles within a tier. Our aim is to compare the performance of this novel system performance with a dedicated design one. The main motivation of proposing a flexible SBS/RS is by enabling more flexible travel of shuttles, the transaction process rate would increase and hence, with less number of shuttles we could obtain the same performance in the dedicated SBS/RS. We simulate the two system designs where the flexible SBS/RS is modelled by an agent-based modelling approach where shuttles and orders are defined to be agents interacting with each other. We compare the two system designs under different velocity profiles of shuttles. The results show that the proposed flexible travel of shuttles between aisles provide better performance metric results in terms of average flow time per transaction, maximum flow time of transactions, throughput rate outputs than the dedicated system design. Hence, more smart algorithms in operating of those shuttles could be developed to increase this novel system performance. As future works, more experiments on those two design by also including warehouse rack designs could be considered. Besides, different layouts and decision making rules for that flexible system design could also be developed and tested.

The research area stretches on the position of 109.107222° – 109.134944° E and 7.561361° – 7.577306° S with an elevation ranging from 29.0 – 232.0 m. The total magnetic field strength data obtained in the field are in the range of 41.804.58 – 46.719.76 nT. After some corrections and reductions were applied, then the local magnetic anomalies data can be obtained with values ranging from -2,961.11 – 1,516.31 nT. The obtained local magnetic anomaly map still shows complicated closures, so making interpretation difficult. The pseudogravity transformation has been applied to reduce the complexity of the magnetic anomaly contour map and the difficulty of interpretation. The pseudogravity anomaly map acquired looks more informative with values ranging from -115.94 – 124.29 mGal. The highest value of the pseudogravity anomalies data is 124.29 mGal located at the positions of 109.131225° E and 7.569342° S; and interpreted as the location of a very compact basaltic rock intrusion. To clarify the lithological contact boundaries of the basaltic rock intrusion to the surrounding rocks and its distribution pattern, the calculation of the horizontal gradient has been applied to the pseudogravity anomalies data.

279,Life Insurance Premiums Dwiguna Joint Life And Last  Survivor With Makeham Law,"in this paper we determined dual life insurance premiums with the combined status of last survivor and join life involving two insurance participants who have kinship relationships such as husband and wife, brother and sister, where they work in the same agency. in determining the policy that will be made by the life insurance party does not require two policies to be made, but simply have one policy. so by having one policy it is expected that the premium paid by life insurance participants to the life insurance company will be smaller than if you have to pay in two policies. determination of dual-use life insurance premiums that will be paid by participants to the insurance party based on the chance of death of both participants of life insurance, by stating a condition that will continue as long as there is at least one surviving member and will stop after the death of the last person of its members (all members die), and is also a state that lasts as long as all members of the combined several people can survive and will stop after one of its members first dies. to determine a single premium and an annual premium use the cash value of the initial life annuity of a dual-purpose life insurance. meanwhile, the cash value of early life annuities was influenced by interest rates and discounted factor and also influenced the combined life chances of two insurance participants. furthermore, before the annual premium is determined, it is first determined a single premium. in formulating the chances of death insurance participants use the makeham law, which is a development of the gomperzt law. in this distribution there are constants used to determine the chances of life and the chance of death.","annuity, premium, last survivor, joint life","Sum insured Last survivor life insurance is paid to the heirs until the last death of the insurance participant. The cash value of an annuity for the last survivor's dual life insurance is influenced by the discounted vaktor and the life chances of the insurance participants. By using makeham mortality acceleration, premiums are obtained that increase until the last death of insurance participants in the case of last survivor. So for a married couple who work in the same agency it would be better to use last survivor insurance than to use individual life insurance.

284,Overview Of Hydroforming Research With Bibliometric  Indicators,"bibliometric research focuses on quantitative analysis of bibliographic materials. it provides a useful method of classifying information according to different variables, such as by journal, institution, and country. this article presents a systematics research analysis of research on hydroforming using bibliometric indicators. these indicators have many advantages; in this case, they provide a broad picture of, and identify the most influential research in, hydroforming. the analysis here focuses on pertinent journals, research articles, authors, institutions, and countries. the results reveal that yuan sj is the most influential author, journal of materials processing technology and the international journal of machine tools manufacture are the most influential journals, harbin institute of technology is the most influential institution, and china is the most influential country in the field.",hydroforming,"A general survey using a bibliometric method has been provided for the field of hydroforming. From the survey, we may observe that the results are in conformity with the popular information. The results show that there is a high degree of dispersion in hydroforming studies, and that there are several effective countries that have spearheaded the China in this scientific field. Moreover, the results reveal that Journal of Materials Processing Technology is the most effective journal in this field, and that the Harbin Institute of Technology is the most effective institution in this field, followed by the Pusan National University. Regardless of the institution, there are numerous effective authors in this area from different countries, including Yuan SJ, Lang LH, Kang BS , Liu G etc. Focusing on American researchers, they have a strong effect in the hydroforming research, having 9 institutions in the top 25, and being responsible for Journal of Materials Processing Technology, which is probably the most common journal in this field. Despite the general bibliometric overview of hydroforming research that the present article has presented, it should be noted that there are certain disadvantages; the data provided are only informative, and are only directed toward research in this particular scientific field.

285,Assessment Of Airplane Seat Pitch Design Using Saudi  Anthropometric Data,"in a tenacious debate of airline profit versus passenger safety due to shrinking seat pitches and adding more rows in airplanes, this research is conducted to find appropriate seat measurements that allow for a brace position in a typical economy seat. in the last 40 years, airlines have been decreasing seat pitches steadily. in the 1970s, the average seat pitch is around 35 inches and currently it is around 28 inches. the distance reduction between rows of seats raises safety concerns as it can be extremely harmful during an emergency landing when passengers need to adopt the brace position but cannot due to cramped space. bracing during an emergency landing is extremely vital in reducing impact forces on passengers as many studies showed that the brace position is necessary to increase the chances of surviving a plane crash. the purpose of this research is to use anthropometric measurements to provide airplane designers with different body dimensions needed to design appropriate and safe seating that accommodates the majority of passengers. the findings of this research provide the body dimensions at different bracing postures to ensure that the largest percentage of adults are able to perform a safe bracing position. the data was collected for a hundred male and a hundred female saudis subjects who resides in riyadh. the output is listed in a standard anthropometric table that can be utilized from different perspectives. it is believed that this research is the first to address the problem from an anthropometric point of view and it can be used as a base to regulate the distance between rows of seats by government agencies.","brace for impact, in fact, from 1983 to 2000","The results of the analysis revealed that the most prevalent seat pitch fits more than 95th%ile of Saudi males at an angle of 45 with the back of the seat. Also, during our research, we noticed that two vital factors are missing, the first is that there is no one conclusive study on the recommended angle that people should apply during the brace for impact position, that is why we have calculated the percentiles for three different angles. The second is that there has not been any Saudi anthropometric data collected, which means that the Saudi population is excluded from the world anthropometric data on seat pitches. However, anthropometric databases are only updated when a new survey is conducted and, as this is a major and costly task, it is not done with great regularity. Thus, we recommend that the next time a survey is conducted, they should take into consideration the Saudi population. Finally, they should also take into account secular trends in anthropometry since the trend in the increase in people’s sizes is likely to continue and some allowance for this should be included in any new requirements which may have a life of ten years.

290,A Mini Review Of Islamic Stock Market Literature,"the world has been pursuing an alternative form of the stock market for quite some time because of chronic financial crises endured repeatedly over the past few decades and a failure to protect investor rights as a result so that the interests of all relevant stakeholders can be safeguarded. in line with devout muslims' point of view, because of certain unsatisfactory clauses from the islamic law point known as shariah, the modern type of stock market limits a muslim to making investments in the market. thus, the stakeholders need to create and introduce a new stock market product to attract the muslim society investing their money in stock, namely the islamic stock market. the islamic stock market is the same as the conventional stock market; the difference between two types of the stock market is the shares traded on the islamic stock market under islamic principles. every activity in the islamic stock market does not contain the elements of gharar, usury, maisir, and risywah. the present paper will provide a brief overview of the islamic stock market literature collected from various sources and produce a summary of the results and conclusions based on the findings. a mini-review of the islamic stock market is done by reading and analysing 14 journal articles. this article is summarised in two tables below. the first table contains information about journal articles regarding the title, author, publisher, and publication year. the second table includes the journal article's contents, including the research objectives, findings, and recommendations. this study's findings are the islamic stock market applies principles according to islamic rules and avoids usury. the islamic stock market is also more resilient to financial crises or economic shocks than conventional stock markets. we also found that the islamic stock market tends to be integrated and to minimise risk can diversify. finally, most islamic stock markets have a causal relationship between the stock market.","gharar, usury, maisir, risywah","The Islamic stock market is efficient; therefore, there is no need for investors and regulators' concerns to reduce market efficiency. The Islamic stock market also applies Islamic rules, and these rules form the basis of regulations and laws relating to the Islamic stock market. The Islamic stock market provides relevant information to support a dynamic Islamic stock market's development as a potential investment alternative.","anwar puteh, jumadil saputra and zairihan abdul halim faculty of business, economics and social development universiti malaysia terengganu 21030 kuala nerus, terengganu, malaysia anwarputeh@unimal.ac.id, jumadil.saputra@umt.edu.my, zairihan@umt.edu.my abdul talib bon department of production and operations universiti tun hussein onn malaysia 86400 parit raja, johor, malaysia talibon@gmail.com",

The Government has limitations in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals so that through the partnership principle, a company can collaborate with the Government to realize this agenda. It is also not only at the central level where regulations or guidelines for the business world have been regulated. However, at the local government level, it is also necessary to follow up in making regulations or guidelines for the business world regarding contributions that can be made in line with the SDGs' achievement. So that the awareness of all stakeholders regarding the SDGs is indeed an absolute requirement. Business sector activities play an essential role in solving sustainable development challenges through their creativity, investment, and innovation.

294,Application Of Lean Six Sigma To Improve The Food Bank  Singapore’S Vending Machine Replenishment Process – A,"lean six sigma is a well-established and widely adopted process excellence methodology across various industries. it is known for its step-by-step approach to process improvement using the dmaic framework while encompassing various lean tools at different stages. its applicability in non-profit organisations has produced positive results in increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of operations. however, the research on the application of lean six sigma is limited within food banks globally as most food banks adopt the lean approach towards process improvement. therefore, through a case study of the food bank singapore, this research aimed to discover the feasibility of lean six sigma in improving the packing and replenishing of the food bank singapore’s vending machines, also known as the food pantry 2.0. the applicability of lean six sigma in a food bank was shown through a reduction in packing time with less manpower involved at the warehouse. applying the voc, the customers’ food preferences was fulfilled along with a significant decrease in food wastage at the vending machines. however, it is recommended for the process to be continuously monitored and refined to facilitate the expansion of the food pantry 2.0.","lean six sigma, dmaic, 5s, food banking","This research featured the application of LSS in a non-profit organisation – The Food Bank Singapore. Although non- profit organisations face limited funding for manpower and technology as well as having to rely on volunteers to execute most of the laborious activities, the avenue to streamline and reduce operations process variations through the use of LSS methodologies is enormous. The DMAIC framework provided a structured step-by-step problem-solving approach for improving the packing and replenishing process of the vending machines in FBSG’s warehouse through the use of various lean tools. The VOC provided a thorough understanding into the food preferences of the vending machines’ customers, thereby enabling FBSG to better match the food bundles to the customers’ preferences. Additionally, the Spaghetti Diagram and PVTA allowed the researchers to identify areas of inefficiencies in the packing and replenishing process before applying the 5S methodology to streamline the initial process and develop a systematic process. The application of LSS proved to be effective as the new packing process achieved almost a 36% reduction in packing time with two volunteers instead of three volunteers in the initial process. Additionally, the supervisor has more control in the new process compared to the initial process where the volunteers had to make most of the decisions. 7. Limitations and Recommendations The results were limited based on a single pilot test site – The Food Pantry 2.0 at Toa Payoh, where only the VOC and the profile of the customers residing within that area were obtained. As the expansion of The Food Pantry 2.0 is still on-going after this research was concluded, further research can be considered in the following areas: • Formulate a packing and replenishment schedule to integrate all the vending machines across different sites.

298,Location Design Of Electric Vehicles  Charging Facility:  Distance-Based Method Approach,"currently, the indonesian government is building electric vehicles to replace fossil-fueled vehicles. one of the drivers to downstream the electric vehicles is the availability of infrastructure, namely the charging station. a strategic activity that must be carried out in supply chain network design (scnd), includes decisions about the location, number, and capacity of production facilities. in this study, we used semarang city, indonesia as a case study. we assumed the local government of semarang city has to ensure the provision of charging stations in collaboration with some places like malls, markets gas station, and so on, to ensure optimal coverage of charging stations with feasible distances between points. it is important to design an optimal supply chain network to achieve this goal. this research proposes a supply chain network model for charging station facilities in semarang city to cover all consumers with the fewest number of charging stations and minimum cost. the malls and markets located throughout semarang city are potential locations that will be chosen as charging stations. the model used is built from a combination of models in previous relevant studies. the distance-based method is selected to achieve optimal solutions and models are executed with cplex applications. the results of this study are expected to provide benefits and input recommendations to the semarang city government to support the use of electric vehicles.","charging station, e-track, facility location","The development of a supply chain network model for charging station cases in Semarang has been carried out. The model has been run taking into account the location of the selected candidate's charging station. This model can provide input to local governments on optimal solutions in determining the location of Electric Vehicle charging stations. However, the weakness of this model is that it still uses numeric examples in determining the demand of electric vehicle users, so that the results obtained have not fully covered the demand in the city of Semarang. Therefore, the shortcomings and limitations of this model need to be accommodated in further research by improving data collection and processing methods and adding scheduling parameters, traffic density, and maximum battery capacity as well as the duration of recharging on the model, to answer the problem in a real and accurate way under real conditions.

321,Online Learning In The Time Of Covid-19 Crisis:   Its Implementation And Challenges,"this article illustrates the implementation of online learning in the time of covid-19 outbreak in indonesian context through teachers’ empirical experiences. drawing from the survey from 128 teachers as respondents of the research across the country the research concludes that most of the teachers who conduct online learning reveal some difficulties and challenges. there are some internal barriers, i.e. teachers’ incompetent to implement such technological devices, too many online classes and administrative tasks, un-conducive situation at home. on the other hand, the external barriers i.e. unstable internet connection, student less motivation to learn, and less support from the parents. looking at the learning processes, many teachers prefer to use the most popular platform to maintain their classes, i.e. google class, edmodo, microsoft office 365, and zoom meeting. furthermore, whatsapp became the primary choice of social media to support the main lms. the research also found some teachers’ learning media preferences indicator to choose the platform, i.e. its user friendly, simplicity, accessibility, and owned by all students. accordingly, this research has huge potential contribution to the field of educational technology, especially on how this field of studies cope with the crisis in education in this pandemic time.","covid-19, online learning, social factors","In conclusion, teachers’ voices based on their daily experiences reveal many priorities, patterns, preferences, and challenges toward the implementation of online learning as one of the most preferred distance educations. According to the finding of this research there are technical and non-technical barriers of online learning, ranging from poor internet infrastructure to teachers misunderstanding about how to conduct online learning. The popularity of such digital technology products (e.g. WhatsApp, Zoom, Google classroom) determine the preference of teachers and students to use such learning media. The availability of the technological tools also play an important role on how to determine the strategy of teaching-learning delivery. It seems that teachers are always trying to overcome the learning problems according to the contextual problems they face. Furthermore, the importance of empowering the students and teachers in this Covid-19 crisis needs to be considered appropriately, because the massive use of technological advancement is always related to several sociological issues.","edi subkhan, haryono haryono and heri triluqman budisantoso department of curriculum and educational technology, faculty of education universitas negeri semarang, indonesia edi.subkhan@mail.unnes.ac.id, fransharyono@mail.unnes.ac.id, heritl@mail.unnes.ac.id","references, there are several reasons why teachers 
decide to choose such learning media, i.e. user friendly, simple, cheap in price, available at school or at home, 
interesting, accessible, support the learning materials learnable, and has been used by most of the students (popularity).    
Fourth, varieties of learning resources. The survey found an interesting fact that many teachers admit that they are 
trying to create their own learning materials for the students (41,3%). This finding is quite surprising since they are 
amid the Covid-19 crisis, but they have huge motivation to create their own learning media. The second highest 
number teachers choose to use YouTube as the main learning resources (30%). The third choice of learning resources 
is websites (22%). The fourth preferable learning choice is school textbook officially published by the Ministry of 
Education and Culture (MEC) (1%). Unfortunately, the respondents state that the official learning resources 
established by the government is less popular, for example learning media released by Rumah Belajar (under 1%). 
According to the finding of the survey, there is a shift among the teachers from mainly based their teaching practices 
on school textbooks officially published by the government toward broader internet-based learning resources, e.g. 
YouTube channel and useful websites. Additionally, the survey also found that 49,5% of the students—according to 
teachers’ admission—were involved in such learning activities through watching materials in several YouTube 
channels proposed by their teachers. 
 
Sixth, assessment method. Related to the assessment method, most of the teachers prefer to assess their student 
achievement through giving students’ writing assignment on the Learning Management System (LMS) (92 
respondents). This might be the easiest way to assess students’ achievement because teachers only need to put the 
tasks on LMS, then students are asked to upload the assignment, and finally teachers grade the students’ assignment 
online. The second assessment method used by most of the respondents (31 respondents) is observing students’ 
performance through such online presentation and discussion within such synchronous platforms, e.g. Zoom or Google 
meeting. The next second assessment method used by the respondent is asking the student to create Vlog and then 
assessing it (31 respondents). The fourth assessment method is based on LMS by observing the students’ involvement 
in some discussion forum (20 respondents) and asking the students to create an infographic (20 respondents). The rest, 
many respondents said that they are using Google form and WhatsApp group to assess their students’ tasks. The 
respondent also said that in several cases, assessing students’ performance only through online media is not optimal, 
but in this crisis time it is the best way that they can do.  
 
Seventh, problems and challenges. One of the most interesting issues related to the learning practices in the Covid-19 
crisis is the shifting of the learning places. Previously, schools are the main basis of learning practices, now home has 
become the main place to learn anything safely. The survey found that most of the teachers (72,9%) conducted their 
teaching practices at home, followed by 64,5% teachers who manage their teaching practices from the office (school), 
and the rest (2,8%) depend on their teaching practices on public internet facilities (Warung Internet). In this crisis 
time, the shifting of learning places and the use of distance education in the form of online learning based on the 
internet resulted in a different process of learning. In some cases, the learning activities are effective enough, but in 
another case, there are ineffective learning practices because of many noises and disruption at home.  
 
Moreover, regarding the problems and challenges they face the respondents state that lack of internet connection is 
the main barrier of conducting such online learning as well as the expensive price of the pulse to access the internet 
(43%). Teachers also feel that their workload is overloaded and results in ineffective learning activities (20%). Other 
teachers feel that their inability to use and manage such learning media based on digital technology also prohibits 
them to conduct such effective and meaningful learning activities (15%). Unconducive situations at home for several 
respondents also affect their inability to maintain online learning appropriately (15%). The rest of the respondents 
raise several barriers, for instance students who have less motivation to get involved in online learning practices, 
students who get bored with online learning and their abundance tasks. According to these problems and challenges, 
the respondents also propose several recommendations, e.g. the government should increase the internet subsidy for 
teachers and students, expanding and improving internet infrastructures throughout the countries, more parents’ 
responsibility and involvement on supporting their children’s learning activities at home, need more technological"
322,Self Esteem And Problematic Internet Use During   The Covid-19 Pandemic. Does It Matter?,"the covid-19 pandemic has significantly impact for global activity. in particular, problematic internet use to be serious issue among college student. internet must to used for online school from home. intensity to access internet for everyday can appear problematic internet use. government rules to stay at home have escalated the consumption of digital entertainment. in some cases, this leads to ones inability to control behavior, thought, and feelings in cyberspace, where individuals feel more confident because they are protected by anonymity and make new relationship in a short time can attract those who have low self esteem and low social skills to switch to the internet. therefore, this study aims to determine the relationship between self esteem and problematic internet use among indonesian collage student during covid-19. this is quantitative research. the technique sampling used was cluster random sampling. the research data was taken using two modification scales, namely piu scale and self esteem scale. the result of this research indicate there is a negative relationship between self esteem and problematic internet use in indonesian collage student. based on the result, the researcher can prevent or attempt to intervence in this problem.","college student, covid-19","This study proves that there is a significant negative relationship between self-esteem and problematic internet use in UNNES students during COVID-19. The higher the student's self-esteem, the lower the problematic internet use they experience. Likewise, the lower the student's self-esteem, the higher the problematic internet use. Furthermore, the problematic internet use among UNNES students during COVID-19 is in the medium category and the students’ self- esteem is in the high category.","dyah ayu rahmawati, fatma kusuma mahanani, andromeda moh. iqbal mabruri and sri rahayu psychology department, faculty of education universitas negeri semarang, indonesia dyahayurahmawatifip@mail.unnes.ac.id, fatma.psi@mail.unnes.ac.id, andromeda@mail.unnes.ac.id, iqbal@mail.unnes.ac.id, srirahayuu.yy@gmail.com",
323,Makakamba-Makakimbi:  The Original Religion Of The Donggo Community Before,"this paper describes the indigenous religion practiced by the donggo community in bima regency. the original religion that developed in the donggo community was known as makakamba-makakimbi. the focus of this paper is its existence in the form and practice of the makakamba-makakimbi belief and its dilemma in the siege of official religions. the results of this study indicate that the makakamba-makakimbi which once lived and developed among the bima community is an indigenous religion (indigenous religion) adhered to by the donggo community before the entry of official religion (which is recognized by the government). this practice of belief is expressed in the form of giving offerings (soji ro sangga), with the hope that agricultural products will be abundant and avoid harm. during its development, the existence of makakamba-makakimbi as the original religion of the donggo community has faded after the presence of islam, catholicism and protestant christianity in the donggo district area. now, even though makakamba-makakimbi is no longer there, we can still see the practice in official religious practice by some of the donggo (syncretic) community, especially in mbawa village.","makakamba-makakimbi, original religion, official religion, march 7-11","Before the emergence and development of official religion, the Donggo people already had an original religion that was still thick with animism and dynamism since their ancestors. The original religion which is cultured by the Donggo community is known as makakamba ro makakimbi. Makakamba can be interpreted literally as a source that emits light. source that emits light. Meanwhile, Makakimbi is a flickering or sparkling light. Makakamba and Makakimbi as the original religions or indigenous religions (indigenous religion) of the Donggo community have in common with the concept of animist beliefs and dynamism that developed in the community. If the concept of Makakamba is a form of dynamism that develops among Dou Donggo, then the concept of Makakimbi becomes a representation of his animism. The forms and practices of the Makakamba-Makakimbi concept are expressed in a variety of expressions. The appearance of Dewa Langi (God of Heaven), Dewa Oi (God of Water), Dewa Mango (God of Dryness) and Dewa Wango (God of Wind) is a representation of this belief concept. The spirits of the ancestors are called Marafu, their place of residence is called Parafu, and the generation below is called Waro. Parafu and Waro intercede in prayer and during worship. The worship of the gods as a representation of Makakamba-Makakimbi is expressed at certain moments. This is usually done when a disaster strikes the community or when agricultural products are abundant. In addition, worship is carried out during the change of seasons such as the beginning of the rainy season and the prolonged dry season and death ceremonies. Local religions began to be eliminated and abandoned by the Donggo community after the arrival of official religious teachings. Nevertheless, elements of animism and dynamism in the teachings of makakamba ro makakimbi are still alive and even practiced by them. These local religious beliefs and practices are still adhered to and believed and carried out by some of the Donggo community to this day. In his religious practice, Dou Donggo practices religious syncretism both among Muslims and among Catholics and Protestant Christians. This fact is a sign that the sikretik in religious belief and practice is still strong. The spirituality of belief in Makakamba-Makakimbi has survived and is embedded in the official Dou Donggo religion until now.","entering the official religion in bima usman jafar hukum tata negara islam fakultas syariah dan hukum uin alauddin makassar gowa, 92175, indonesia email: jafarusman1958@gmail.com surayah rasyid sejarah dan kebudayaan islam fakultas adab dan humaniora uin alauddin makassar gowa, 92175, indonesia email: rasyidsorayah@gmail.com aksa sejarah dan kebudayaan islam fakultas adab dan humaniora uin alauddin makassar gowa, 92175, indonesia email: aksa131288@gmail.com sabara balai penelitian dan pengembangan agama makassar makassar, 90111, indonesia email: barackfilsafat@yahoo.co.id m chairul basrun umanailo department of agricultural and forestry university of iqra buru namlea, 97571, indonesia chairulbasrun@gmail.com",

Teachers were familiarized with the media after the online learning policy was enacted. Teachers who had been able to use the media in dancing and other learning were still young and technology-oriented. Moreover, older teachers preferred WhatsApp-based learning, so they only delivered materials and instructed students to carry out self-learning.","in primary schools uring the covid-19 pandemic ika ratnaningrum, atip nurharini, teguh supriyanto sigit yulianto and noening andrijati primary teacher education, faculty of science education universitas negeri semarang, indonesia ikaratnaningrum@gmail.com, atip.nurharini@mail.unnes.ac.id, teguhpgsd@mail.unnes.ac.id sigityulianto@mail.unnes.ac.id, noening06@mail.unnes.ac.id",
325,The Implicit Memory Bias During Pandemic Covid-19 In  University Students,"the covid-19 pandemic has been causing mental health problems, one of which is anxiety. the cognitive model theory state bias in implicit memory plays a significant role in causing a person to experience intense anxiety and severity. this study aimed to examine the effect of stimulus presentation (threatening & non-threatening) on implicit memory bias in the anxious and non-anxious participants. this study used a factorial experimental research design and used the psycopy version 3 program to create computer-based experimental manipulations. a total of 46 participants (22 anxious and 24 non-anxious) of college students joined this research. a computer-based word stem completion test (wsct) used for measuring implicit memory bias and stai for participants selection. a two-way anova (2x2) with jasp software to test the hypothesis. the results showed that there was an effect of the presentation of the stimulus on implicit memory bias. the presentation of a threatening stimulus caused implicit memory bias in both groups (anxious and non-anxious).the implication study results will be discussed in more detail in the discussion.",anxiety,"that can be drawn are:1.) there is an effect of a threatening stimulus on implicit memory bias in the anxious (t=-11,59; p<0,05) and non-anxious (t=-16,21;p<0,05) groups. The analysis results show that there is an effect of the stimulus presentation on implicit memory bias. The result is in line with previous research (Memarian & Azaraein, 2015; Russo et al., 1999). Anxiety level does not affect implicit memory bias. It may occur because the participants involved in this study did not diagnose having clinical disorder. It is in line with previous research, which states that implicit memory bias occurs in groups who experience clinical disorders such as social phobia (Coles & Heimberg, 2002; Memarian & Azaraein, 2015; Wenzel & Holt, 2002), depression (Baños et al., 2001; Barry et al., 2004), PTSD (Amir et al., 2010; Coles & Heimberg, 2002) and does not occur in non-cilinical anxious samples (Wilkerson et al., 2005). 6. Conclusion Generally, this study's conclusion suggests an effect of the presentation of the stimulus on implicit memory bias. Only the threatening stimulus presentation affects implicit memory bias, both in the anxious and non-anxious groups. Moreover, there is no difference in implicit memory bias in presenting neutral stimuli, both in the anxious and non-anxious groups.","liftiah liftiah, sukma adi galuh amawidyati, abdul haris fitri anto sugiarianti sugiarianti and yurid zaida zen department of psychology, faculty of education universitas negeri semarang, indonesia lifti4@mail.unnes.ac.id, sukmaadi@mail.unnes.ac.id, abdul.haris.fitri.anto@uinsby.ac.id, sugiariyanti_psi@mail.unnes.ac.id, zen.zaida45@gmail.com",

327,The Differences Of Students’ Burnout From Level Of  Education And Duration Daily Online Learning During,"the covid-19 pandemic changes to activities in teaching activities. this research was specifically conducted to determine the state of student burnout caused by online learning during the covid-19 pandemic. this study aims to analyze the students’ burnout from level of education and duration daily online learning during covid-19 pandemics. school burnout inventory (sbi) were distributed among 2.310 students and analyzed using crosstabs analysis and also two ways anova. school burnout inventory (sbi) was distributed among 2,310 students who conducted an online survey using the google form application. the data were analyzed using crosstabs analysis and two ways anova. the findings showed that most students at the junior high school (49.9%), senior high school (52.8%), and university (43.8%) levels had online learning duration between 1 and 3 hours per day. the findings of this study also indicated that there is a difference in the interaction between education level and duration of daily online learning at the level of burnout (f (8, 2295) = 2.47, p <0.05). this research has implications for guidance and counseling services for students during the pandemic and the new-normal covid-19.","covid-19, students’ burnout","and Recommendations This study has described the level of student academic burnout during learning in the COVID-19 pandemic. University students tend to have higher levels of academic burn out compared to senior high school and junior high school students. Interestingly, during the online learning activities in the COVID-19 pandemic, there was no difference in the level of burnout between students who allocated a small amount of online learning duration (less than 1 hour per day) and more. In accordance with the findings of this study, educators at the junior and senior high school level are recommended to increase students' motivation and readiness to engage online learning so that their learning duration increases. In addition, teachers are expected to present learning materials in a more structured and systematic online learning format for guiding students to increase their daily learning duration. Educators at universities are recommended to monitor the students’ study load and assignments so that they are prevented from burnout. For further research, it will be valuable in the future to conduct experiments of online learning formats that have impact on burnout prevention. In addition, studies that lead to exploration of the impact of academic burnout during the COVID-19 pandemic on their mental health and learning performance are very important to be achieved.

336,Estimated Spline In Nonparametric Regression With A  Generalized Cross Validation And Unbiased Risk Approach,"regression analysis is widely used to determine the pattern of the relationship between predictor variables and response variables. nonparametric regression is a regression analysis in which the regression function is unknown and the response variable is correlated. splines are polynomials that are segmented and flexible so they can adapt effectively to the local properties of data. the shape of the spline estimation is influenced by the lambda parameter when determining the location of the knots point. this study examines how to develop a spline estimation form in nonparametric regression cases by selecting the optimal node using the methods of generalized cross validation (gcv) and unisex risk (ubr). from the data used, the optimal knot point is 0.000130245 and 0.000402165 for the number of splines 5 and 20, respectively. the results of this study indicate that ubr tends to be smaller than the gcv value.","spline regression, knots point","Based on the analysis and discussion, the conclusions are as follows: 1.

It means that company leaders must consider liquidity, profitability, leverage, company size and interest rates to avoid financial distress. This implication is considered very important because it can be used to make decisions related to financial distress in companies by considering financial ratios such as liquidity, profitability, leverage, company size, and interest rates against conditions driven by economic stimulus. However, it is also necessary to pay attention to the Economic Stimulus, which can moderate these variables' relationships. This study's results are expected to contribute policy implications to company management, investors and potential investors, and other related parties.","yoyo sudaryo, mohd hassan che haat, jumadil saputra, mohd yusoff yusliza and zikri muhammad faculty of business, economics and social development universiti malaysia terengganu 21030 kuala nerus, terengganu, malaysia y.sudaryo2@gmail.com, hassan@umt.edu.my, jumadil.saputra@umt.edu.my, yusliza@umt.edu.my , zikri@umt.edu.my",

The political awareness step is to raise political awareness from the level of magical and naive awareness to the level of critical awareness. Not all people have to have critical awareness, because of course awareness steps take a long time if done on a massive scale. Awareness steps can be started from the political elite, by providing political education that is not only oriented towards practical politics (power struggle) but also political morals. Even this political awareness step is not only useful for the opposition but also for the authorities. So that even though they practice dynastic politics, the power elite is still oriented towards development that is right on target for regional progress.","imam yuliadi, sumitro, and anwar institute of social and cultural sciences samawa rea moyo hulu, 84316, indonesia imamyuliadi0@gmail.com,sumitro765@gmail.com, anwardonggo8@gmail.com m chairul basrun umanailo university of iqra buru chairulbasrun@gmail.com edykurniawansyah mataram university mataram, 5271101, indonesia almusukyedy@gmail.com muhammad rusli social welfare science department of halu oleo university muh.rusli@uho.ac.id zulham ibrahim political science department of universitasmalikussaleh zulhambere@gmail.com",

Summary and Conclusion Since the estimation of the hospitalized duration of patients’ treatment is an important issue for health authorities, the statistical regression modeling procedure is utilized to predict it based on the personal characteristic of age, symptoms, and underlying diseases of the patients contracted to Covid-19. The research has been conducted in the Iranian northern province of Guilan, where the personal data of 1015 patients were available. The regression analysis revealed that the hospitalized duration of the patients does not depend on patients’ symptoms and their underlying diseases but it depends on the age of all patients and they were ended to death. In terms of application, the results support health authorities to manage patients’ admission procedures where they are supposed to consider that the patient’s age has reverse and significant effects on hospitalized duration. Researchers interested in working in this field are recommended to focus more on specific personal characteristics such as lifestyle, food, place of birth, and the other factors contributing to the immunity of the human system.","abbas mahmoudabadi and maedeh pourmirza dogahi industrial engineering & information technology department mehrastan university, guilan, iran mahmoudabadi@mehrastan.ac.ir, m.pormirza1364@yahoo.com",

349,Implementation Of Sustainable Manufacturing In Indonesia  Paint Industry Based On Triple Bottom Line,"the manufacturing industry is currently faced with many challenges both from competitors and from stakeholders. the paint industry is one of the manufacturing industries that has received a lot of attention so that it can become a sustainable manufacturing industry. the implementation of triple bottom-based sustainable manufacturing can be a solution to these sustainability challenges. the purpose of this study was to analyze the implementation of green manufacturing and its effect on the sustainability of the decorative paint industry using the sem-pls method. the pls sem method was chosen because it works efficiently for small sample sizes and complex models. the results of triple bottom line modeling using sem pls show that the input category indicator has a negative effect on the economic dimension and does not affect the social dimension. operations and output category indicators have a positive effect on the social dimension. prediction accuracy is moderate for the social dimension and high for the relevance value for the social dimension. this shows that environmentally friendly products can increase social trust for both employees, customers and the surrounding community but are perceived to have a negative impact on the economy from the use of environmentally friendly input materials.",decorative paint,"Input variables have a negative influence on the economy, but have a positive influence on social. Operation and Product variables have a positive influence on the Economy and Social Affairs. The variable that has a significant effect is product on social, while other variables have an effect but not significant. The accuracy of economic estimation is in the weak category while Social is in the medium category. Input variables to the Economy, Operations on the Economy and Social Affairs and Products on the Economy have a moderate effect size. Input variables on Social have a small effect size and Product variables on Social have a large effect size. Predictive relevance for Economy is small, but for Social predictive relevance is large. The negative effect of input on the economy is very likely to occur, because to make environmentally friendly paint requires a special material at a high enough cost so that industrially it has a negative effect on the company economy, but from the customer side, employees and society will feel the economic benefits. In assessing the effect of green manufacturing on sustainability manufacturing (Environmental, Economic and Social), actual data on company achievement can be used, not only survey data for respondents, so that they can provide an assessment of the effect that is closer to the real condition of the company.","gun nanda tian purnama master of industrial engineering student gun.nanda.tp@gmail.com sawarni hasibuan master of industrial engineering programme universitas mercu buana, jakarta, indonesia sawarni02@gmail.com, sawarni02@mercubuana.ac.id",
350,Designing English Teaching Model At The Remote Area  Schools Of Maluku In Covid-19 Pandemic Situation,"the emergence of the covid-19 outbreak in the world has affected all sectors. likewise, in the education field, this forces educators to look for innovation in supporting teaching and learning activities, especially in remote areas. therefore, this study tries to design an english learning model based on a needs and situation analysis of schools located in remote regions of maluku. this research employed the research and development (r&d) method using the 4d model (define, design, develop, and disseminate), which in this article only presented two stages, namely define and design. the research sample consisted of 170 subjects from five high schools in buru regency, maluku. the collected data employed needs and situational analysis questionnaires, which were analyzed descriptively. the analysis result was used to design an appropriate english learning model for schools in remote areas. this study found that the english learning model that is suitable to be involved in remote areas is the multi-blended learning model. this model is expected to contribute to the government and schools in implementing learning in remote areas.","english teaching, model, remote area","Based on the findings and discussion above, it can be concluded that the needs of students in schools located in remote areas in the Buru district require blended learning by combining offline and online. They also need curriculum simplifying and adapting to the core material based on the schools' existing syllabus. English learning materials should start with material that is easy and that is around the students. To support the success of learning English in remote areas, the right design to be applied is multi-blended learning, which is by combining several methods and approaches in learning, namely face-to-face, online, independent learning, and small groups starting with planning that is mature by the teacher by controlling the implementation of each stage carried out and evaluating all the stages that have been passed. This learning model has not been tested for its effectiveness experimentally; therefore, it is recommended that the following researchers who research in this field try this learning model experimentally and some improvements to the learning stages according to the results achieved in implementing this model. At the very least, this model has contributed to providing solutions for schools in remote areas to learn within the limitations of learning goals.","saidna zulfiqar bin-tahir, a yusdianti tenriawali, m chairul basrun umanailo, risman iye universitas iqra buru, maluku, indonesia saidnazulfiqar@gmail.com, tenriawali@gmail.com, chairulbasrun@gmail.com, rismaniye@gmail.com muhammad hasyim, ade yolanda latjuba, abbas abbas cultural sciences faculty, hasanuddin university, indonesia hasyimfrance@unhas.ac.id, adeyolanda@unhas.ac.id, abbas@unhas.ac.id",

358,Performance Evaluation Of Virtualized Networks To Serve  The Smart Iot Applications,"recently, emerging technologies such as mobile devices and applications, social networks, cloud computing, and big data have experienced explosive growth. consequently, the end-users demand higher data rates with better quality of services (qos). this paper proposes a software-defined-network (sdn) architecture that can be used to serve multiple applications and technologies. network simulation models are used to evaluate the performance of that architecture as well as various ones representing the traditional networking technologies for different scenarios under different conditions. the simulation results show the improvement of the sdn performance over the others. moreover, the traditional architectures have been implemented and tested in two mobile operator’s production environments and test labs. the practical measurements are compared with the simulation results for consistency. this work is considered as sdn proof-of-concept and interoperability with other technologies which is an essential aspect during the migration to sdn. so, a hybrid proposed model is simulated to gain benefits of sdn at the lowest cost keeping part of traditional network as well.","sdn, open daylight, simulated networks, iot applications","In this paper, the measurements were done by measuring different scenarios in Lab simulation and made a valuable comparison in different mobile operators' networks with the production environments getting use of real traffic with real impact of customers causing network congestion. So, all the results are significant and trusted. Performance survey is applied to measure various scenarios under different conditions serving the behavior of the IoT or new technology applications. This paper applied the same architecture built-in operators to apply new changes that will modify its performance at the lowest cost and risk. Its main target is to enhance the service delivery, maximize network utilization, and ensuring end-user max available data rate. The rise of the 4G and its main challenges and the cellular network consists of many connected devices so a huge amount of data is generated. Therefore, to cope with this issue, the UDP performance results are better and more reliable when used with SDN and the enhancement in the TCP will not deserve that investment to migrate to fully SDN. So, if kept in the existing network will perform acceptably w.r.t cost. So, each operator or entity has to identify the need and the purpose of the investment in order to define its direction.","mohamed abdellateef and hussein a. elsayed electronics and communications engineering department ain shams university cairo, egypt mohamed.abdellateef@gmail.com, helsayed@eng.asu.edu.eg michael n.a. ibrahim electronics and communications engineering department ain shams university and the british university in egypt (bue) cairo, egypt michael.ibrahim@eng.asu.edu.eg",

361,Serious Game Data Collection Using Shared Database,"serious games offer an interactive platform for teaching and evaluating processes. it incorporates educational elements (such as programming language and healthcare) into the game environment to support teaching and learning. it also helps to assess the student’s knowledge and performance. serious games are a fun and effective tool for students that increases the engagement and motivation of students by being interactive and engaging. data from serious games can be used to assess student’s learning. however, gathering the data from the game is not that straight forward. different factors in the game environment need to be considered, such as whether the game is an online or offline game and whether the data need to be captured in a shared data storage (i.e. shared database). in this project, we focus on investigating techniques to retrieve game setting data from the database and to save game data to the database. these techniques are applied in an online serious game developed by temasek polytechnic for a specific programming subject. the questions for a specific topic are saved in a shared database as the game setting data which will be displayed in the game to the students. the students would then interact with the content within the game to answer these questions and the game data (i.e. answers that students provide, time taken to answer the question, and score) will then be passed into the shared database for analysis to be able to give feedback to the learner using statistics derived from the data collected. we investigated two techniques to retrieve and save data from/to the shared database. the two techniques are real time processing and batch processing. real time processing requires the game to retrieve the game setting data when it is needed and send the game data once it is being collected. while batch processing retrieves all the game setting data in advance (i.e. when loading the game for the first time) and accumulates all the game data before sending to the shared database. we implemented both techniques in one online serious game and compared the results. when comparing both methods, we found that real time processing is a resource intensive process through multiple web requests and that the data that is being sent to the database might be incomplete when player ends the game prematurely. in our application, it's important to optimize the retrieval and sending of data. this is due to the game being a web game and the need to cater for an expandable number of users. having complete data is also important as we want the analysis to be accurate when displayed graphically to relevant stakeholder. hence, we went with batch processing as our method to retrieve and send data to the database.","serious game, educational game, data passing, singapore",,"elroy chua, zulfami ashrafi, muhammad rizal ismail, nur aisha khalid, linda william school of informatics & it temasek polytechnic 21 tampines ave 1 1805798d@student.tp.edu.sg, 1801137i@student.tp.edu.sg, muhammad_rizal_ismail@tp.edu.sg, nur_aisha_khalid@tp.edu.sg, linda_william@tp.edu.sg",
362,A Three-Level Supply Chain Of Self-Healing Packages  Considering Direct And Indirect Carbon Emission Of,"self-healing packages in a supply chain are the current trend of the different studies as global warming is rising due to the increased carbon emission in the environment. this paper aimed to create a mathematical model of a three-level supply chain of self-healing packages, following the ssmd policy. this study also considered the direct and indirect carbon emission costs to have a sustainable supply chain. it was evident in the result that the different parameters such as the holding cost of products finished (hm), tax per carbon emission (ctax), energy loss rate (ei), energy consumptions (h, c, e, s), fuel consumptions, fuel price (γ and δ), and industrial indirect emission factor (δi1), greatly affected the total cost of the mathematical model. a three-level supply chain can benefit from the presented mathematical model. in addition, an industry utilizing self-healing packages can apply the three-level mathematical model created to manage the whole system.","carbon emission, kyoto protocol, mathematical model","This study was able to develop a mathematical model under the three-level supply chain that considered self-healing packages. This study focused on direct and indirect carbon emission cost from industrial and transportation aspect. Lowering the total cost also lowers the carbon emission (Ong et al., 2020). The integration of the model from Ong et al. (2020) and Sarkar et al. (2019) showed that supply chains can undergo optimization of the total cost and carbon emission. The different parameters that mainly dealt significant changes such as hm, Ctax, and EI, together with the carbon emissions from heating, cooling, steaming, and electricity turned out to be the reason for an increase in total cost. Moreover, the fuel consumption, fuel price, and industrial emission factor increased the total cost if the values also increased. The reason for this is that these carbon emission factors are the main parameters being utilized to run the supply chain. Therefore, the model resulted to the proportionality of carbon emission and total cost utilized in three-level supply chains. In summary, this sustainable supply chain mathematical model could be used by a three- level supply chain in real-life application that considers self-healing packages. This model was able to follow the Kyoto Protocol. The self-healing packages as an application in supply chain as packaging is essential because it keeps the product unaffected from any damages.

363,Three-Level Closed-Loop Supply Chain Considering  Carbon Emission Of Industrial Cost,"this study developed a mathematical model for a closed-loop supply chain (clsc). it considered the single set- up multiple delivery policy, carbon emission of industrial and transportation of the clsc, and self-healing packages. the model was able to show that utilizing the self-healing packages can lessen the carbon emission and the total cost throughout the process. moreover, the results show that most of the parameters had a significant change in the total cost after undergoing sensitivity analysis. this numeric behavior was evident due to the relation of the assumed equal demand throughout the whole process of the clsc. however, there are also parameters that showed an inverse relationship and infinitesimal effect on the total cost. this occurred due to the utilization of the cslc and self-healing packages. lastly, the application of this study can benefit the optimization of the closed-loop supply chain and organizations that utilizes the clsc and self-healing packages. companies can utilize the model to have a competitive edge and promote a green supply chain.","carbon emission, optimization","This study was able to develop a mathematical model of a closed-loop supply chain that took into account the SSMD policy, self-healing packages, and the direct and indirect carbon emission from the industrial and transportation aspect of the CLSC. It was evident in this study that the notion of Ong et al. (2020) applies to the mathematical model that was developed in this study, in which it states that when total cost decreases, the carbon emission also decreases. These said concepts also provided a competitive advantage for the business while taking into account the expenses that the Kyoto protocol and carbon tax can bring. Moreover, the utilization of the self-healing packages in this study showed a novel solution to the problem of rampant greenhouse gas emissions and innovative packaging for businesses. Thus, it provided a solution not only to the cost that the traditional packaging can bring but also to the problem of the traditional supply chain as one of the contributors to carbon emission.","for self-healing packages jose ma. luis salazar, ardvin kester s. ong young innovators research center mapúa university, manila, philippines 658 muralla st., intramuros, manila 1002, philippines jmlds14.ls@gmail.com, aksong@mapua.edu.ph ma. janice gumasing school of industrial engineering and engineering management mapúa university, manila, philippines 658 muralla st., intramuros, manila 1002, philippines mjjgumasing@mapua.edu.ph",
364,Poverty Level Analysis In Indonesia Using The Stochastic  Restricted Maximum Likelihood Approach Method,"analysis of economic data relating to the level of poverty in indonesia is conducted to determine the factors that affect the poverty index. this needs to be done as a material for the government's consideration in planning national development. model analysis was performed using a logistic regression model. logistic regression analysis is a statistical analysis method that describes the relationship between the dependent variable (response) which has two or more categories with one or more independent variables (predictors) on the category scale or interval scale, with the dependent variable coded zero if the province has a poverty percentage below percentage of poverty in indonesia, and coded if the province has a poverty percentage above or equal to the percentage of poverty in indonesia. this study aims to analyze the level of poverty in indonesia using a logistic regression model. parameter estimation is done using the stochastic restricted maximum likelihood estimator (srmle), where this method can only be used on data containing multicollinearity. multicollinearity data often appears in economic data because an increase in the value of one variable will affect the increase in other variables. four independent variables were taken, namely the unemployment percentage, the underemployment percentage, the poverty depth index and the poverty severity index. of the four variables, the poverty depth index and poverty severity index are variables that contain multicollinearity. the results of the analysis with a significance level of 0.05 indicate that the percentage of unemployment and depth of the poverty index are significant variables for the poverty rate in indonesia.","level of poverty, 2019)","The poverty rate of each province in Indonesia on average every year can be divided into two, namely the percentage above or equal to the percentage of Indonesia which is coded 1 and the percentage below the percentage of Indonesia which is coded 0 so that it can be modeled using binary logistic regression analysis. The data used contains multicollinearity so that the SRMLE method can be used as a parameter estimator. By performing the likelihood ratio test and Wald test of the SRMLE model parameters with a significant level of 0.05. Based on the logistic regression model with the Stochastic Restricted Maximum Likelihood (SRMLE) parameter estimator, it can be determined the factors that affect the poverty rate in Indonesia each year, namely the unemployment variable and the Poverty Depth Index.","riaman, sudradjat supian, sukono department of mathematics, fmipa, padjadjaran university, jatinangor 40363, indonesia riaman@unpad.ac.id, adjat03@yahoo.com; sukono@unpad.ac.id abdul talib bon department of production and operations, university tun hussein onn malaysia, malaysia talibon@gmail.com",
365,Determining The Size Of Centrality In Social Networks,"social network theory is becoming more and more significant in social science, and the centrality measure is underlying this burgeoning theory. in perspective of social network, individuals, organizations, companies etc. are like nodes in the network, and centrality is used to measure these nodes’ power, activity, communication convenience and so on. meanwhile, degree centrality, betweenness centrality and closeness centrality are the popular detailed measurements. this paper presents these 3 centrality in-depth, from principle to algorithm, and prospect good in the future use.","social network, centrality, degree centrality",,"mochamad suyudi, sukono department of mathematics, faculty of mathematics and natural sciences universitas padjadjaran, indonesia moch.suyudi@gmail.com; sukono@unpad.ac.id; abdul talib bon department of production and operations, university tun hussein onn malaysia, malaysia talibon@gmail.com","References

366,Theoretical And Simulation Approaches Centrality In Social  Networks,"centrality is an important concept in the study of social networks, which in turn are important in studying organisational and team behaviour. for example, “central” individuals influence information flow and decision-making within a group. however, the relationship between mathematical measures of centrality on the one hand, and the real-world phenomenon of centrality on the other, is somewhat unclear. in this paper, we provide two additional perspectives: an analysis of real-world social-network data, and a study of networks produced by a simulation process. comparing the two perspectives leads to recommendations on when to use different centrality measures.","social network, valued centrality, jordan centrality",,"mochamad suyudi, sukono department of mathematics, faculty of mathematics and natural sciences universitas padjadjaran, indonesia moch.suyudi@gmail.com; sukono@unpad.ac.id; abdul talib bon department of production and operations, university tun hussein onn malaysia, malaysia talibon@gmail.com","References

367,Increasing Labor Insurance Participation   With The Agency System,"labor insurance program is one of government effort in providing equitable welfare for the people. however, it is known that in practice the number of registered participants only reached 41% of the total working population. bpjs labor insurance established a general agency system known as the indonesian social security activator (perisai) to increase the number of participants, especially non-wage workers (bpu). as a provider of social security programs that have been established for a long time, it is necessary to evaluate the innovations that have been developed whether they are effective or not. this study aims to determine what are the factors that cause the low awareness of bpu in bogor city to become a participant in the labor insurance. and to find out the effectiveness of the perisai agency system as a strategy to increase the number of bpu participants in bogor city. the results showed that the effectiveness of perisai's agency system as a strategy to increase the number of bpu participants in bogor city was 74.64%. with the level of achievement at the level of success or effectiveness.",effectiveness,"Based on the results of research and discussion of the Effectiveness of the PERISAI Agency System as a Strategy to Increase the Number of BPU Participants in the City of Bogor, the researchers made conclusions based on the problems studied. The conclusions of this study are as follows: • The factors that cause the low awareness of non-wage earners in the City of Bogor in participating in the Employment Social Security program are caused by : • There are only a few PERISAI who work full time as agents • There are only small number of PERISAI spread in Bogor City • Lack of socialization from BPJS labor insurance to people who work in the informal sector or who do not receive wages regarding the existence of PERISAI • Lack of awareness from BPU participants about the importance of social security protection. • After conducting a descriptive analysis using the effectiveness formula. Based on the results of the descriptive analysis it can be concluded that the PERISAI agency system in Bogor City according to the responses of the respondents in this study is in the ""successful"" or ""effective"" category. The percentage of respondents' assessment is 74.64% but it has not been able to meet the Government's target in providing comprehensive social security protection, namely the number of participants reaching 100%.

368,Fintech Payment Application In Improving   Customer Services,"a finance company is a form of company that takes advantage of technological developments by creating fintech- applications to improve service quality. in 2019, the customer service queue at xyz company (pt xyz) reached 350 queues per month. meanwhile, the cashier queues to make payments an average of 3800 per month. the high level of queues, can certainly have an impact on office effectiveness and efficiency. this study aims to analyze what constraints have caused the low number of fintech payment application users, how to map potential and non- potential customers usage of fintech applications. the results showed that the problem with the low use of the fintech payment application was because 60% of customers did not know the application, 40% of customers did not have a bank account so they could not make transactions on the fintech payment application and 67% of customers chose payment media through outlets / minimarkets even though they had to pay a fee. to determine the effectiveness of using the application, a tam (technology acceptance model) is used which consists of trust, value for profit, convenience, social influence and intention to use.","tam, k-means algorithm","Based on the research results, it can be concluded that 53% of PT XYZ customers who are conducting payment transactions at branch offices already know the fintech payment application because there are banners, posters and brochures stored next to the queue number collection, but only 13 people have ever used / just used it. download. Another obstacle is that as many as 40% of customers do not have a bank account, which means they cannot make payments via the fintech application. The large number of payment media options also causes the use of fintech payment applications to be few, because apart from branch offices, customers tend to make payments through mini- market media for reasons that are close to home, even though the payment will be subject to a transaction fee of IDR 7,500 - 8,000. Higher education in Cluster 1 which is dominated by Senior High School and Others (D2, D3, S1 / S2) is considered to have the potential to use the fintech payment application, because higher education also affects customers in using online payment technology. In addition, because cluster 1 is in higher education, jobs in this cluster are dominated by private employees and civil servants / retirees and are considered to have the potential to use fintech payment applications. Income in dominant cluster 1 is higher than cluster 0, which means it is more likely that respondents have a bank account to save their money. Once the respondent has an account, it will make it easier for companies to transfer payment transactions so that they become potential customers using fintech applications. Based on data mining analysis with the C4.5 algorithm that uses processing through the WEKA 3.7 application, of the 5 existing sub-variables, there are only 3 that determine the effectiveness of using the fintech payment application, namely: • Intention to Use • Trust • Convenience Proceedings of the 11th Annual International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management Singapore, March 7-11, 2021","fredi andria, and dea restu ananda, department of management, faculty of economics, universitas pakuan jl. pakuan po box 452 16143 bogor, jawa barat, indonesia fredi.andria@unpak.ac.id, dearestuananda.dra48@gmail.com amelia rahmi department of accounting, faculty of economics pakuan university bogor, indonesia amelia.rahmi@unpak.ac.id abdul talib bon department of production and operations, university tun hussein onn malaysia malaysia talibon@gmail.com","References

370,Exercise Regiment Modification Concurrent With Pharmaceutical Intervention In Elderly Population: A Review,"as the world’s populations start to age, every country must brace for the so-called “silver tsunami,” this wave of people and for physicians, patients, gradually reaching the age of retirement for a given country. this also gives way to more common syndromes associated with age to become more prevalent. among these one which is very common is osteo- penia and in severe forms osteoporosis, often these are accompanied with sarcopenia as the patients begin to lose mus- cle mass as well. this is caused by a multitude of precipitating factor, as the bones and muscles are both communicating organs, as well as endocrine organs thus making them susceptible to the reduction in androgens associated with old age. these syndromes, often referred to concurrently as osteosarcopenia, may in turn precipitate further health care costs. as patients lose both bmd and muscle mass in concert with the frequent lipid infiltration of these tissues, they will often become more frequently victim to falls and fracture. this problem, being a source of a higher possible rate of mortality and reduced quality of life for senior. to this end research is being done to create a possible effective treatment plan for those with osteopenia and even sever osteoporosis. there is conflicting evidence to the use of hormone replacement therapy in men, however in women there is a positive relationship with its use and reduction of the rate of bmd loss over time. in either gender there exists a positive relationship with the use of resorptive agents. instituting these sub- stances concurrently with an exercise regiment, especially one including resistance training of targeting limbs, and walking for stability. there has been a positive relationship of these regimens not only slowly bmd loss but in fact a net gain of bone density. this of course should also be considered with the relative inaccuracy of dxa with the align- ment of bone geography and inaccuracy related to dxa in high bmi individuals.",osteosarcopenia,,"joanna zorawska, gp, md, phd department of geriatrics, wroclaw medical university, poland joanna.zorawska@umed.wroc.pl julian jastrzab costner student of wroclaw medical university, poland julian.costner@student.umed.wroc.pl",
371,A Review Of Resilience And Well-Being In Human Resource  Management Perspective Literature,"the rapid economic transition requires any company to have a clear concept of sustaining its workers and organisations' success. two concepts of human resource management (hrm) can improve employees and organisations' performance, namely resilience and well-being. its concept is strongly influenced by all parties' behaviour related to employee management, especially the human resources department managing its employees' conduct for resilience and well-being in work. not only on the actions of hrm but also on the organisation's management to provide employees with the needs to improve their performance. this paper seeks to provide an overview of available literature on resilience, well-being, and human resource management perspective through various sources and produce summaries and results based on findings. the review of resilience, well-being, and human resource management perspectives was conducted by reading and analysing 30 peer-review journal articles. this study will summarise the journals article in the table; the first table explains the title, author, and year of publication; the second table describes the model, subjectively discussed, findings, and proposals. the results of this study were documented; the different hr management approaches are aimed to improve the performance of employees and their organisations, secondly; identify resilience gaps together with well-being and the actions implemented by hrm to improve employees and their organisations' performance. in conclusion, hrm's success in improving performance is influenced by its employees and organisations' behaviour.","resilience, well-being","In recent years, the focus on employee well-being has shifted to the scientific research phase of Human Resource Management (HRM). There are various emerging effects and potential costs to organisations that invest in employee well-being; Positive psychology such as resilience, subjective well-being, expectations, and optimism assessed by HRM can provide a viable way to address employee problems. Thus, HRM's well-being concept is very relevant to improve employee resilience, taking into account other aspects that arise. Systems or concepts implemented by organisations should provide results or engagement of individual performance-oriented organisational objectives. Resilience is one of the sources that a person has that helps to avoid impulsive & reactive behaviour. The different HR management approaches aim to improve employees and their organisations' performance, secondly; identify resilience gaps together with well-being and the actions implemented by HRM to improve employees and their organisations' performance. In conclusion, HRM's success in improving performance is influenced by its employees and organisations' behaviour.","netty merdiaty, khatijah omar, jumadil saputra faculty of business, economics and social development universiti malaysia terengganu 21030 kuala nerus, terengganu, malaysia prymmty@gmail.com, khatijah@umt.edu.my, jumadil.saputra@umt.edu.my abdul talib bon department of production and operations universiti tun hussein onn malaysia 86400 parit raja, johor, malaysia talibon@gmail.com",
372,Investigating The Effect Of Micro Waqf Bank Sector  Expansion On Poverty Alleviation: An Evidence From,"in many countries, one strategy has emerged to resolve the challenges for improving access to credit facilities by creating a microfinance institution (mfi) that provides credit to low-income families. however, as a muslim majority country, indonesia has established a new form of mfi that comply with shariah's shariah microfinance institution (smfi). besides the shariah based product, smfi has existed in rural areas, including pesantren is known as micro waqf bank (mwb). it has created to solve the poverty issues among low-income families that live in rural areas. also, the main goal of mwb is to provide the convenience platform regarded as the business capital and financing to middle-lower income people and micro, small and medium enterprises (msmes). in line with the vital role of mwb, the present study is written to investigate the effect of mwb sector expansion in reducing the poverty issues among rural communities at 5 selected provinces, indonesia. this study utilizes the secondary data collected from two sources, i.e. central bureau of statistics (bps) and islamic microfinance institutions and micro waqf banks (imfi - bwm) for 2018 2019. this study found that mwb financing has a significant negative effect on poverty alleviation among rural communities at 5 selected provinces, indonesia. we also found that the number of mwb does not significantly affect poverty alleviation among rural communities at 5 selected provinces, indonesia. on the basis of the study findings, we concluded that mwb plays an important role in reducing poverty among rural communities. in contrast, increase mwb financing institution will be alleviating the poverty among them. also, the number of mwb has not been fully affected by the number of low-income families in rural areas, indonesia, due to the small number of operated mwb in indonesia.",micro waqf bank,"This study aims to determine the impact of micro waqf banks on poverty alleviation of rural communities in Indonesia from 2018 to 2019. Based on research that has been done by conducting, testing the equation model using the common effect model, the fixed-effect model, and a random effect model. The selection of model equations using the Chow test and the Hausman test and the panel data linear regression test using the fixed effect model. Several conclusions are drawn from the results of this study, including Micro Waqf Bank Loan has a negative and significant impact on poverty in Indonesia, which means that when Micro Waqf Bank Loan increases, it will reduce poverty levels. Micro Waqf Bank Financing benefits can improve the welfare of the Indonesian population, and the poverty rate will be reduced. Micro Waqf Bank Loan, which is suitable in alleviating poverty. In carrying out its operations, micro waqf banks are not allowed to raise funds. The source of funds for micro waqf banks comes from social funds, both from corporate CSR and personal donations in collaboration with Amil zakat institutions. The existence of donors plays an important role in the development of the micro waqf bank business model. In empowering the poor, micro waqf banks focus on poor productive communities in financing and assistance. The productive poor have been able to meet basic needs for their survival and have productive businesses or have a strong will and enthusiasm to work. In fulfilling their operational needs, the micro waqf bank's income comes from sharia deposit revenue sharing, financing, and other service income. The difference and uniqueness of micro Waqaf bank from other financial institutions lies in customer assistance. The number of micro waqf banks does not significantly affect poverty in Indonesia. It means that the number of micro waqf banks has not fully affected Indonesia's amount of poverty due to the small number of micro waqf banks available in rural areas in Indonesia. Policy Recommendations This study's results give full attention and support to Islamic microfinance institutions in the form of micro waqf banks. For the Islamic economy, we know that most Indonesian people are Muslim, especially the addition of funding funds sourced from donors channelled by micro waqf banks to low-income families in rural areas in Indonesia. With the increase in donors and the amount of micro waqf bank financing, it can contribute to the poor in poverty alleviation through the increase in UMKM in Indonesia. The recommendation is to increase the number of micro waqf banks in Indonesia. The government needs to make policies that can encourage financial inclusion to grow, especially in Indonesia's remote areas. Micro waqf banks' impact on poverty alleviation in Indonesia is because there are too few waqf banks spread across Indonesia.","indonesia rural communities fuadi, ahmad fauzul hakim hasibuan, rico nur ilham, falahuddin, wahyuddin, muammar khaddafi, munandar faculty of business and economics universitas malikussaleh blang pulo, muara satu, aceh utara, 24355 aceh, indonesia fuadi.msm@unimal.ac.id, fauzulhakim@unimal.ac.id, riconurilham@unimal.ac.id, falahuddin@unimal.ac.id, wahyuddin@unimal.ac.id, khaddafi@unimal.ac.id, munandar@unimal.ac.id jumadil saputra faculty of business, economics and social development universiti malaysia terengganu 21030 kuala nerus, terengganu, malaysia jumadil.saputra@umt.edu.my",
373,Supplier Selection Decision Making In The Pharmaceutical  Industry Based On Kraljic Portfolio And Maut Method:,"the decision to select suppliers is a strategic issue in the pharmaceutical industry because of the tight regulations on the quality, safety, and reliability of raw materials for the drug manufacturing process. the selection of suppliers of raw materials for the pharmaceutical industry needs to ensure conformity to the characteristics and profiles of suppliers with standard supplier criteria in the pharmaceutical industry. the purpose of this study is to evaluate the decision to select suppliers of raw materials to the pharmaceutical industry in indonesia in the case of large volume parenteral or intravenous fluids. the kraljic matrix is used to model the purchase portfolio of raw materials for intravenous fluids in the pharmaceutical industry, based on the dimensions of supply risk and company profitability. the decision framework for supplier selection using the maut method is designed for raw materials belonging to the strategic item quadrant by optimizing the criteria that are the main needs of the company according to the company's procurement strategy and business. the results of the study succeeded in mapping four strategic items from seven types of raw materials for intravenous fluids. the attribute in the supplier selection decision for raw materials for infusion fluids are grouped into five attributes, namely assurance of supply, quality & regulatory compliance, procurement cost, innovation/technical, and responsiveness & communication. each attribute is elaborated into sub-attributes. by using the maut method, the ranking among suppliers was successfully carried out. the purchasing price and assurance of supply attribute differentiate between these three alternative suppliers, however, the first and second rankings meet the criteria to be continued in long-term cooperation because the quality of performance is above the company's minimum standards and still has the potential to improve its performance.","kraljic matrix, maut method","The difference in value between the three supplier values is insignificant and tends to balanced between each other. In priority categories, where each supplier and these criteria meet the criteria for compliance with Quality & Regulatory Compliance in full, become mandatory requirements for raw material suppliers for the pharmaceutical industry. Purchasing Price and Assurance of Supply criteria are the differentiators between these three suppliers, but suppliers ranked first and second meet the criteria for continued long-term cooperation. Related to strategic suppliers whose supply the raw materials becomes very important for the company's business, the strategy of building a relationship with seeking joint advantage with suppliers becomes very important and this can reduce supply risk and increase profit impact for the company.","a case study in indonesia yudi abdillah master of industrial engineering student universitas mercu buana, jakarta, indonesia yudi.abdillah00@gmail.com sawarni hasibuan master of industrial engineering program universitas mercu buana, jakarta, indonesia sawarni02@gmail.com, sawarni02@mercubuana.ac.id",
374,"Techniques For Better Management Of Municipal Solid  Waste Strategies: A Case Study Of Moratuwa Municipality,","effective implementation of municipal solid waste management (mswm) strategies remains an issue in many developing countries. to analyse the effectiveness of the strategies, it is vital to understand the techniques employed to implement such strategies. hence, this paper aims to analyse the techniques in implementing mswm strategies in sri lanka. single case study on moratuwa municipality, which is considered as a critical case, was conducted. the study used a mixed approach; predominantly qualitative. using purposive sampling method, semi-structured interviews were carried among 19 residents, one from each urban division of moratuwa municipal council (mc), 03 mc officers, and 02 waste collectors. additionally, 75 questionnaires were collected from residents. code-based content analysis and quantitative statistical methods were used to analyse the interviews and questionnaires respectively. the community and mc have adopted various techniques in implementing mswm strategies. nevertheless, the community is not aware of some of the techniques enacted by mc. strong communication between the mc officers and community, and between the different municipalities have been recommended for better management of msw. the study has concluded by proposing some mswm techniques that can be utilised by all municipalities in sri lanka as well as in other developing countries that face similar mswm problems.","case study, strategies","and Recommendations The community in Moratuwa municipality as well as the MC have adopted various techniques in implementing the MSWM strategies, which can be introduced to the whole Sri Lanka. However, the community is not aware of some of the techniques enacted by MC. Therefore, if a proper channel of communication is in place to enable the communication between the MC officers and the community, the implementation of the techniques will become more effective. Also, as highlighted in the discussion above, when only one MC follows the proper waste separation and management techniques it might not be good enough to achieve the waste reduction, while the other MCs do not use such techniques. Hence, the good practices followed at Moratuwa MC should be transferred to other MCs in Sri Lanka. To facilitate this, stronger collaboration and communication between the municipalities are essential for better management of MSW in Sri Lanka. It was further revealed that the community has adopted some MSWM techniques by seeing others' behaviours and through social media. Therefore, the researchers suggest using social media as a channel to acclimate society into good waste management practices. Further, based on this case study, it was revealed that none of the community and the MC has adopted any of the techniques in order to implement energy recovery and treatment and disposal strategies, even though such strategies are very significant in MSWM. Therefore, the awareness, as well as the practice of these strategies, should be improved in achieving the proper MSWM process. Moreover, some techniques were proposed by the respondents, which can be used to solve the national problem in MSWM. If all these suggestions are adhered, then the real benefits of effective implementation of MSWM can be realised. Though the study is focused only on Moratuwa Municipality, the existing, as well as the proposed techniques to manage MSW, can be utilised in other municipalities in Sri Lanka to solve the national level problem in waste management. The management of MSW has turned out to be an important matter for most of the developing countries. Thus, as an initial output, this study can be benchmarked to other developing countries, which have similar waste management problems for the effective management of MSW by applying the existing and proposed techniques to manage MSW.

375,Safety Behavior Factors Of Provisioning Technician In  Telecommunication Company,"some jobs in the telecommunications sector are having high risk level of accidents, including the job of those provisioning technicians. in telecommunication companies which were the object of research, the rate of work accidents due to falls from a height and contact with sharp objects has increased in two years periode (2016-2018). therefore, it is important to pay attention to the behavioral aspects of workers to minimize the risk of work accidents. this study aimed to identify the safety behavior factors that are relevant to the job of a provisioning technician. questionnaires were distributed to 179 provisioning technician workers in one company in bandung area. the number of questionnaires returned was 64 (response rate 35,75%). data processing was carried out using exploratory factor analysis to determine the safety behavior factors. the results showed that there were12 indicators that grouped into three factors of work safety behavior namely: safety concern, safety compliance, and safety participation. these safety behavior factors can be used to develop recommendations for safety behavior improvement program for provisioning technicians.","safety behavior, 041 cases","Safety behavior is still an issue that need to be seriously addressed in telecommunication company. The high level of accidental work related in the area is one indication of such. The results showed that there were three factors represented the safety behavior of the provisioning technician: the safety concern, safety compliance, and safety participation. The safety concern factor consists of three measurement indicators, the safety compliance factor includes five measurement indicators, while the safety participation factor consists of four measurement indicators. These three factors can explain 59.8% of the variation in the research data. The loading values on the 12 indicators are in the range 0.440 to 0.818. The factors found are still consistent with previous research but there are adjustments to the measurement indicators. The results of this study can be used to compile program recommendations to improve safety behavior for provisioning technicians. Safety cultures need to be promoted intensively in order to accustom workers with safety and become of their natural work behavior. Further research in the similar area with larger sample need to be conducted to find out whether the results stay and can be generalized.","atya nur aisha 1industrial engineering department telkom university bandung, indonesia 2doctorate program of industrial engineering and management institut teknologi bandung bandung, indonesia atyanuraisha@gmail.com fida nirmala nugraha, indi erdiniaty industrial engineering department telkom university bandung, indonesia fida1619@gmail.com, indierdiniaty@gmail.com",

SAF, EFBBC, LP and GRDP did not have a positive effect on HDI rejected because large SAF is not allocated for increasing the HDI dimensions such as education and health. EFBBC is not a source of financing revenue for regional development which has an impact on increasing HDI. A large population becomes a burden for development so that hampered the increase in HDI. The relatively small per capita income of the community which resulted in a lower purchasing power thus inhibiting the increase in HDI. The research implication is that there is a need for the management of central government transfer funds wisely by local governments. They are according to their respective functions according to government regulations or laws as well as better supervision through equal distribution of community welfare in all districts/cities in South Sumatra Province, especially those related to with HDI indicators such as health, education and income programs, South Sumatra Province will be able to increase the provincial HDI which continues to be in a moderate status from year to year to a high category.","verawaty accounting department of economics and business faculty universitas bina darma palembang, indonesia verawaty@binadarma.ac.id muji gunarto management department of economics and business faculty universitas bina darma palembang, indonesia mgunarto@binadarma.ac.id rolia wahasusmiah accounting department of economics and business faculty universitas bina darma palembang, indonesia rolia.wahasusmiah@binadarma.ac.id citra indah merina accounting department of economics and business faculty universitas bina darma palembang, indonesia citraindah@binadarma.ac.id",

380,Sentiment Analysis Using The Support Vector Machine   For Community Compliance Representation,"the increase in positive cases of covid-19 in indonesia is still relatively high. the main factor affecting the high number of positive cases of covid-19 in indonesia is the decreasing level of citizen compliance. this study aims to build a model of citizen compliance representation through a sentiment analysis approach using social media. the method used to build this model is done with a text mining approach, using the sentiment analysis by support vector machine (svm) algorithm. this model was built using the term large-scale social restrictions (lssr) as a key phrase. this key phrase is interpreted through four main types of activities, namely work from home (wfh), studying at home, transportation, and physical distancing. we used data from twitter and news period april-august 2020. this representative model of citizen compliance during the covid-19 pandemic is able to show a visualization of the condition of citizens' compliance levels grouped by city and province. the citizen compliance representation model shows an accuracy rate of 98% for wfh activities, 93% for learning activities at home, 88% for transportation activities and 90% for physical distancing activities. this model can be an initial reference for identifying the level of compliance of citizens with regard to government policies related to programs for handling covid-19 cases in indonesia.","citizen compliance, covid-19","The government's efforts to reduce the spread of the Covid-19 outbreak can be carried out through sentiment analysis on the level of public compliance. The main objective of this research is to analyze the sentiment level of community compliance with LSSR activities using the SVM algorithm. In this study, the sentiment analysis of the level of public compliance with the LSSR rules is focused on the rules of studying at home, WFH, transportation, and physical distancing activities. The Indonesian people have the highest compliance with the LSSR physical distancing rules which reaches 80.9%, and the lowest level of compliance with the LSSR transportation rules only reaches 50.21%. The level of compliance of the Indonesian people to the rules of LSSR WFH and studying at home reached 70.7% and 62.67%. This sentiment analysis is also able to map the level of community compliance based on the domicile of cities and provinces. The overall accuracy rate of sentiment analysis reaches 92.25%. This analysis of the level of community compliance can be used to formulate strategies and government policies in the process of reducing the spread of the Covid-19 outbreak, through a process of strengthening socialization and a humanist LSSR control system. A more intensive socialization of LSSR by empowering community strengths who really understand the character of their citizens can be done by referring to a sentiment analysis of the level of community compliance in each city or province.

381,Promotion Of The Motif Kujang Design By A* Algorithm  Application In The Labyrinth Education Game,"kujang (sundanesse cleaver) as one of the cultural heritages of the sundanese people (residents of west java, indonesia) has various attributes. these attributes can be used as a media for learning culture by the community. currently the introduction of kujang is only limited to general information. in fact, each attribute of the kujang contains a very meaningful cultural philosophy. one of the cultural philosophies on the kujang is shown in the motif design of the kujang. this study aims to build a digital promotion media of kujang through a labyrinth educational game which is implemented using the a* algorithm. the use of the a* algorithm is expected to guide educational game users to find the final destination of the maze by choosing the fastest path. in this educational game, there are five choices of labyrinth paths that formed from five motif kujang designs. this research shows the novelty that refers to the application of the motif kujang design as a labyrinth route. the labyrinth route which is formed from five motifs kujang ie. : tapak nanggala, tirta sadana, nagabandang, waruga sungsang, and hanjuang, which has different route difficulty levels. based on the results of the usability test, it shows that globally the respondents show a level of comfort in using educational games at the level of 71.72%. the interactive and interesting promotion of the motif kujang design can be done through this game by providing an experience of exploring the maze paths based on the motif kujang design. the labyrinth education game based on the motif kujang design is able to perform well in the aspects of control (82.25%), efficiency (70.75%) and effects (70.01%). this game still shows moderate level in learnability performance (63.95%). this research is still limited to the creation of labyrinth paths based on the motif kujang design and has not been equipped with the strengthening of information on the meaning of other cultural attributes contained in the motif kujang design. therefore, the opportunity to develop research towards strengthening information on the meaning of attributes integrated with the appropriate algorithms is very potential.","a* algorithm, educational game, kujang","This labyrinth game as promotion and learning media, success introduce the pamor kujang to student and public. This game is designed as an alternative media for introducing the prestige of the kujang pamor to the general public and the millennial generation. The introduction of the pamor kujang consists of the name pamor kujang and the labyrinth in the form of a kujang. The gameplay used in this game is education and maze puzzles. Then the games are designed for various types (android, offline, single player, 3D / 2D) using software (Unity 3D, Blender and Photoshop). Using the MDLC (Multimedia Development Life Cycle) method as a design method in application development. The algorithm used is Algorithm A* (A-Star) which functions as a path search. By using this algorithm, the closest path will be formed to get out of the maze which will make it easier for players to complete the level in this game. The structural and functional testing phase of the buttons for moving between scenes in this pamor kujang educational game is in accordance with its function. In the testing phase, the validation of the coordinates of the starting point and the coordinates of the target finish point to make the closest path to get out of the cleaver maze is valid, and at the compatibility test stage to run this game requires an android mobile phone with a minimum of 2 GB of RAM but the game runs a little slow, meanwhile for android mobile phone specifications which have 4 GB of RAM and 8 GB of RAM. Game applications can run well without problems. Usability test of this game shows that there are still deficiencies because the results of the graph show the percentage of learnability is lower than other categories, this is because in this study there is only one learning, namely learning about pamor kujang. However, it can be concluded that the pamor kujang educational game media is quite suitable to be used to help promotion and socialize the pamor kujang through educational games, because the test results from multimedia experts or lecturers and the general public show a value above 50% so that it can increase the attractiveness and interest in studying the prestige of kujang.","eneng tita tosida, restu wibowo, sufiatul maryana department of computer science, universitas pakuan jl. pakuan po box 452 bogor 16143, jawa barat, indonesia enengtitatosida@unpak.ac.id, restuwibowo16@gmail.com, sufiatul.maryana@unpak.ac.id abdul talib bon department of production and operations, university tun hussein onn malaysia, malaysia talibon@gmail.com",

386,Generating Maximum Prime Patterns Using Benders  Decomposition And Apriori Algorithm,"incorporating data mining tasks in different levels of planning has become an essential tactic in business, industry, and other sectors. the rationales for implementing a data mining task, such as classification, significantly increase if the techniques used in classification provide optimal results. logical analysis of data (lad) is a classification approach known for its promising accuracy in classification and its capabilities in providing interpretable pattens. the main challenge in implementing lad is the pattern generation problem. in this study, the pattern generation problem is solved to optimality to find maximum prime patterns. the proposed approach incorporates benders decomposition and apriori algorithm to generate prime patterns with high coverage from past observations. these patterns are then employed to build lad classifiers that are used to assign class labels to unseen observations. computational experiments conducted on seven public datasets show that results of lad classifiers, established by using the proposed pattern generation algorithm, surpassed results of six machine learning algorithms implemented in ibm spss modeler.","data mining, pattern generation, apriori algorithm","Logical analysis of data is a machine learning algorithm that has shown competitive results when applied to binary classification problems. Among the steps required to implement LAD, solving the pattern generation problem is the most challenging one. In this paper, a new decomposition approach is developed by employing the Apriori property in the combinatorial Benders decomposition approach to generate optimal maximum prime α-patterns. Prime patterns are known for their high accuracy of classification. Computational experiments are conducted to compare results of the model proposed to results of six machine learning algorithms implemented by IBM SPSS Modeler 18.1. Seven public datasets are used in these computational experiments. The experiments demonstrated a promising performance of the proposed approach.

387,Using Anova For Optimizing Thermal  Profile Process In Assembly Line Of Printed,"the aim of this paper is to provide anova study for thermal profile process of manufacturing printed circuit boards (pcb). the thermal profile process controls the cycle time and temperature level of the oven, in other words, the solder joints have to reach the correct cycle time of the soldering temperature. therefore, it is challenging to simultaneously control the temperatures in different zones with specific cycle time in each zone. the solder paste and components should be well-matched in the heating slope for each zone; the solder paste has different types and different manufacturers. also, these variables (temperature and time in each zone) are interconnected and thus, result in good quality in solder joint; they also determine which variables are more significant to get good solder quality by using design of experiment (doe). minitab software will be used for doe. the data of the research are collected from real assembly line of pcb. obtaining a better yield via improving the time of the pcb assembly process is another aim of the research. hence, the outcome to all of these attempts of optimizing the assembly line of pcb for continuous improvement is to deliver good quality products, reduce cost, and minimize the time of delivery and meet the customer expectations. key words: printed circuit board, oven, pcb, thermal profile, doe proceedings of the 11th annual international conference on industrial engineering and operations management singapore, march 7-11, 2021 © ieom society international 4296",,"Analysis of variance (ANOVA) is analyzing the behavior of the variables and error of the variables, which help to adjust and improve the thermal profile. Studying the thermal profile process of manufacturing Printed Circuit Boards (PCB) is to control the cycle time and temperature level of the oven using Box-Behnken designs. The quality of the solder joints is very critical to the lifetime of the PCB and the performance of the PCB. In this study of the local company of assembly line determined which variables are more significant to get good solder quality. In this study case, all the variables are impotent and none of them are neglected but understanding the behavior of each variables, ANOVA helps on the adjustment and optimization temperatures in each zone as shown on table 4. The study helps to minimize the iteration of prototype by having to try until getting the desired zones temperature. In addition, getting a better yield via improving the time of the PCB assembly process where time included oven programming, iteration retry, automated optical inspection, and visual inspection. Moreover, fewer prototypes printed circuit board. In terms of cost save, there are about 6 minutes for each iteration of the thermal profile and if the retry happened only 4 times, this means 24 minutes; assume the programing for the oven occur only once a week, so there are 21 hours.

388,Three-Level Closed-Loop Supply Chain Optimization  Considering Self-Healing Packages,"the challenge for maintaining a competitive and sustainable supply chains have been considered nowadays. to compete in the market, smart packaging and the utilization of closed-loop supply chains are widely studied. the self- healing packages and closed-loop supply chains are main components to help reduce carbon emissions. this study was about a three-level closed-loop supply chain considering self-healing packages of a single-supplier, single- manufacturer, and multiple retailers. the model was developed and optimized algebraically considering the overall cost minimization. results of this study showed that the model could be used in real-life application. total costs could be reduced by manipulating the different parameters such as the ordering costs, set-up costs, holding costs, purchase price and maintenance cost of self-healing packages, forward and reverse logistics transportation cost, and forward logistics variable transportation costs.","carbon emission, optimization","This study was able to develop a mathematical model of a three-level closed-loop supply chain that considers self- healing packages as the main transport packaging under the SSMD policy. In this model, the optimization of the total cost will also optimize the total carbon emissions, making the supply chain sustainable since the model was majorly adapted from the papers of Sarkar et al. (2019) and Ong et al. (2020). With this in mind, there are different parameters that greatly affect the total cost of the mathematical model created for this study. These were the ordering costs (𝑂𝑂𝑚𝑚), setup costs (𝐴𝐴𝑚𝑚) , holding costs (ℎ𝑚𝑚, ℎ𝑟𝑟) , purchase price and maintenance cost of self-healing packages (𝑆𝑆𝑠𝑠1, 𝑆𝑆𝑠𝑠2, 𝑆𝑆𝑚𝑚1, 𝑆𝑆𝑚𝑚2), forward and reverse logistics fixed transportation costs (𝐹𝐹𝑠𝑠1, 𝐹𝐹𝑠𝑠2,𝐹𝐹𝑚𝑚1,𝐹𝐹𝑚𝑚2) and forward logistics variable transportation cost (𝑉𝑉𝑠𝑠1). The key reasons why these parameters significantly impacted the three-level closed- loop supply chain considering self-healing packages were: (1) the ordering cost of inventory increases the holding cost of a company while otherwise increases setup costs. (2) A self-healing package requires a huge amount of purchase and maintenance cost. (3) forward and reverse logistics have high transportation costs due to different processes done in each transport.","diorelle oneil c. gallarza, ardvin kester s. ong, luis carlos miguel m. ebora, jake matthew c. depositar, jiuan limson c. andrada young innovators research center mapúa university, manila, philippines 658 muralla st., intramuros, manila 1002, philippines docgallarza@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, aksong@mapua.edu.ph, lcmmebora@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, jmcdepositar@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, jlcandrada@mymail.mapua.edu.ph ma. janice gumasing school of industrial engineering and engineering management mapúa university, manila, philippines 658 muralla st., intramuros, manila 1002, philippines mjjgumasing@mapua.edu.ph",

390,Improve Quality Aircraft Simulation Training In  Indonesia Using Dmaic Six Sigma Methods,"the development of aviation safety must be supported by reliable pilot competencies. one of the ways to realize the pilot competencies is by employing aircraft simulation. the objective of this research is to reduce the level of discrepancies in the king air b200gt/350i aircraft simulation by using the six sigma dmaic method (define, measure, analyze, improvement, control). other tools for analyzing problems are pareto diagrams, cause and effect diagrams, and fmea. the discrepancies of aircraft simulation which become priority for improvement are the 47 percent discrepancies of the aircraft control system, the 30 percent discrepancies of modeling, and the 17 percent discrepancies of the cockpit i/o. the order of improvement priority is sorted from the highest rpn value at the repair stage. after the implementation of six sigma, the discrepancies decreased from 45 percent to 14 percent, the sigma level increased from 2.53 to 3.16 and the cost of poor quality fell from idr 64 million to idr 28 million per month.","discrepancies, simulation, six sigma","Based on the results of the analysis described in the stages of define, measure, analyze, improve and control, it appears that the use of the six sigma DMAIC method can increase the quality of aircraft simulation training. This can be seen from the DPMO data which decreased from 152231 to 48226, the sigma value increased from 2.53 to 3.16 and the COPQ decreased from IDR 64,923,750.00 to IDR 28,329,375.00. This study also generally confirms previous research that the DMAIC six sigma method is proven to be effective in reporting and analysis of defective products and can increase the capability / sigma level to obtain a higher quality product. It is hoped that the aircraft simulation will be enhanced with a wide variety of methods so that it will improve the quality of aircraft simulation training which in turn will create high flight safety.","danang ary yunanto master of industrial engineering student universitas mercu buana, jakarta, indonesia danang.kalibrasi@gmail.com hasbullah master of industrial engineering programme universitas mercubuana, jakarta, indonesia hasbullah@mercubuana.ac.id sawarni hasibuan master of industrial engineering programme universitas mercubuana, jakarta, indonesia sawarni02@gmail.com, sawarni02@mercubuana.ac.id",
391,A Review Of The Driving Factors That Affect Job Performance  Literature: A Mini-Review Approach,"in the world of globalisation, the most valuable assets of an organisation are human resources. an organisation's success or failure is entirely on the basis of the calibre of the individuals working therein. organisations will not progress and thrive without constructive and innovative contributions from individuals. therefore, in order to accomplish an organisation's objectives or activities, they need to recruit people with the expertise, credentials and experience required. the key purpose of an organisation is the effective and efficient management of human resource. for achieving the organisation's goal, the human resource (h.r.) department must be developing excellent strategic planning to ensure all of the employees can contribute significantly to the organisation. in line with the most valuable assets (h.r.), the present paper attempts to understand the driving factors affecting job performance literature, including leadership, motivation, personality, job stress and workload collected from the various relevant sources. this research is designed to use a qualitative approach by literature review. the driving factors affecting job performance analyses were carried out by reading and reviewing 30 peer-reviewed journal articles and summarised on the basis of the subject in two tables, namely article journal and publisher distribution, and article category. this study's findings are that leadership, personality, workload, and job stress significantly affect employee work motivation. also, the variable of employee work motivation has a significant effect on job performance. by following this study's results, we conclude that leadership, personality, workload, and job stress are driving factors that influence employee work motivation. besides that, we also conclude that employee work motivation indirectly affects employee job performance. thus, it is not deniable that the moderating variable may be any specific effect in the relationship between leadership, personality, workload, job stress, and employee work motivation toward employee job performance, such as job satisfaction. for future research, we suggest examining the moderating role of job satisfaction on drivers factor of employee performance.","leadership, personality, workload, job stress, job satisfaction",,"nunuh, mohd yusoff yusliza, jumadil saputra and zikri muhammad faculty of business, economics and social development universiti malaysia terengganu 21030 kuala nerus, terengganu, malaysia nunuh@itltrisakti.ac.id, yusliza@umt.edu.my, jumadil.saputra@umt.edu.my, zikri@umt.edu.my abdul talib bon department of production and operations universiti tun hussein onn malaysia 86400 parit raja, johor malaysia talibon@gmail.com","References

The schedule shows the distribution of ORs on different surgery groups. In this study, an integer linear programming optimization model is formulated to solve the MSSP problem under block scheduling strategy. The objective of the model is to minimize the number of possible blockings between intraoperative and postoperative stages and to minimize the fluctuations in postoperative beds occupancy. The model takes into consideration the current postoperative occupancy of patients and the parameters related to ORs, postoperative beds, and surgical nurses. By applying the model in a private hospital, a reduction in number of blockings between stages and levelled beds occupancy were achieved. Additional analysis was carried out to give the hospital administration an overview on the effect of varying the number of patients per block and length of stay in the postoperative stage on the developed master surgical schedule. Increasing the number of patients per block has significantly increased the number of blockings between stages in nearly all cases. Also modifying the length of stay in postoperative stage led to occurrence of blockings between stages almost daily in all cases. Further work could be performed by including the preferences of surgeons, number of served patients, number of waiting patients, and costs to the proposed mathematical model. In addition, the use of a heuristic or meta-heuristic algorithm to solve the research problem could be investigated.","d. sheweita, h. fors, n. harraz production engineering department alexandria university alexandria, egypt post-dina.salah@alexu.edu.eg, hadifors@alexu.edu.eg , nharraz@alexu.edu.eg",
402,Conceptual Framework Of The Critical Success Factors Of  Green Building Towards Sustainable Construction In United,"the green building construction industry requires high-tech technologies and innovative systems. in addition, the green building green building construction industry is currently facing overinvestment problems due to an unreasonable delay in completing the project; these factors affect the overall quality of the green building construction project. the aim of this study identify the critical successes factors affecting green building construction industry projects in the uae. these factors should will be taken into consideration in developing a framework for critical success factor for sustainable building in uae. the framework could be helping project managers in making a decision in the sense that the factors are crucial and should be gained more focus. however, since there are more building companies and many building projects do not meet scheduled completion dates. more specific, the data of this study will be collecting from the al naboodah construction group (ancg). according to the company profile the total of employees around 14000 in uae. this study is important for stakeholders in the green building construction industry in general and for uae stakeholders in particular, including: project management companies.","green building, technologies, innovative systems","This study is important for stakeholders in the green building construction industry in general and for UAE stakeholders in particular, including: project management companies- to identify current trends and requirements in the green building construction industry. Furthermore, to Abu Dhabi authorities-by helping them to develop better plans that can be integrated into the Abu Dhabi 2030 Plan and Project Manager & Employees-to understand the scope, significance and relevance of the project management approach in the green building construction sector and how it can be implemented for UAE green building construction projects. Given the significance of sustainable building, a list of success factors obtained from various literature sources have incorporated into a survey instrument. The framework could be helping project managers in making a decision in the sense that the factors are crucial and should be gained more focus. As this paper covers only success factors of sustainable building, it is a logical step that success factor should come in pair with success criteria as well. In a sense, the success factors help to develop good measures or more popularly known as criteria or performance indicators. The limitation of this paper lies in the rather small sample size. It is generally agreed that a sample size of more than 200 is needed to obtain a robust result. However, this should not be overlooking the contribution of this paper given the reliability of variables still attainable. Moreover, this paper serves only as an exploratory research. More empirical research should be conducted to obtain a reliable framework. Given the limitations, future research should be focused on several issues such as sample size, research method (more robust method like principal component analysis and confirmatory factor analysis) and examined success factors from case studies to achieve methodological pluralism.

The innovation of OSS by the city of Makassar in providing licensing services have made licensing services more concise and simple, this also being reflected in a significant drop in the time required to provide the needed services. This has been achieved by providing the licensing authority in the OSS alone, so license applicants do not have to visit several Offices or agencies. In addition, the government of Makassar City has also change governance laws and processes to further simplify the licensing process, so that the process is much more refined and quick to implement. The net result of the reform of public services into integrated services Offices has resulted in an increase in the number of license applicants, reflecting a better atmosphere for investment and business in Makassar City.","kasmad kamal, muhammad ardiansyah makmur, andi ni’mah sulfiani and syamjaya sm faculty of social and politic science andi djemma university palopo, south sulawesi, indonesia kasmadunanda@gmail.com, ardyansyahmakmur93@gmail.com, andi.nimah305@gmail.com, kecengsyamjaya86@gmail.com",

408,Acoustic Vibration Sensing And Control Mechanism For  Boilers,"coal fired power plants are increasingly evolving and with the increase in population the plants now face high demand for electricity production. coal fired plants are progressively looking for ways to improve the plant efficiency by using predictive maintenance methods which include acoustic cleaning. the research is mainly focused on sasol synfuels power station which is situated in secunda in the mpumalanga province of south africa. sasol realized that the boilers are no longer performing as they should due to soot deposition on the boiler tubes, this has led to increased operating cost. this research reviews and investigates acoustics technology that can be used for boiler online monitoring and developing a method that can detect acoustic vibration induced by an acoustic horn. the theory is that acoustic horn produces sound energy that causes vibration on the boiler tubes which can be detected using acoustic vibration sensing devices and the signals can be converted into readable information through a closed loop control mechanism. structural and modal analysis are performed which shows the stresses that the components experience under operation conditions. the modal tests have shown the maximum deformation where the components will experience the highest frequency resonance.","acoustic vibration, control mechanism, boilers, modal analysis","The approach to this research was to do a literature review where different articles were studied on similar projects to determine the feasibility of this project. In addition to literature review, data collection questions were compiled and used to interview one of Sasol’s artisans. The selected sensor for this project is an accelerometer which is widely used for vibration detection purposes. For monitoring systems, soot thickness sensor, temperature sensor and pressure sensor will be incorporated. The sensors will be mounted on the boiler tubes using a magnetic mounting plate. A closed loop control mechanism for this purpose was recommended because it requires little to no human interaction, the system should monitor without interrupting the boiler operation. The simulations done in this project allows us to determine the areas of the design that needs to be improved. Acknowledgments: We will like to acknowledge SASOL Africa for supporting this research.","bongi mhlongo department of mechanical and industrial engineering technology university of johannesburg johannesburg, south africa 217025736@student.uj.ac.za daramy vandi von kallon department of mechanical and industrial engineering technology university of johannesburg johannesburg, south africa dkallon@uj.ac.za",

410,Investigating The Efficiency Of Centrifugal Pumps Via Fea,"the area of significance to a centrifugal pump design is the impeller geometric parameters that help achieve pump performance. the recent investigation conducted at rand water show that the loss of hydraulic performance of centrifugal pumps used at their pumping stations is as a result of the detachment of the impeller neck rings on the impellers. a design modification to the casing wear rings or impeller neck rings was recommended to smooth the entry of water into the eye of the impeller by reducing the gap between the casing wear ring and the impeller neck ring. various tests are performed on the centrifugal pumps at the zuikerbourch rand water pumping station and show that design parameters such as the diameter of the impeller, blade angles, number of blades, suction diameter and discharge diameter can have considerable influence on the performance of the centrifugal pumps. a model and simulation to predict the efficiency losses of these pumps is proposed. computation fluid dynamic (cfd) simulations are carried at the different parameters and it was observed that it saves time and costs of the company when designing the centrifugal pump.","centrifugal pumps, pump performance","The objective of the research was to investigate the factors that cause excessive power consumption during pump operation and to determine the causes of efficiency losses in the centrifugal pumps at Rand Water. The focus in this research was to determine the factors that affect the hydraulic efficiency of the pump and conduct tests for centrifugal pump performance and compare the results of the operation duty point with the previous tests. The centrifugal pump was designed and tested at different parameters which include the impeller diameter, blade angle, number of blades, suction and discharge diameter of the centrifugal pump. It was found through simulations and calculations that the design stage of the pump is critical for the hydraulic performance of the pump. The calculation results showed that the discharge and suction diameters of the centrifugal pump does not have much effect on the hydraulic efficiency of the pump. It is concluded that the suction area should exceed the discharge area for the pump to be efficient. The affinity law is considered to be efficient for improving the hydraulic performance of the pump. To increase the number of blades an additional material will be required, therefore, more cost. The weight of impeller will be higher thus more power will be required to operate the pump (Li, et al., 2020). Depending on the size of the pump, the number of blades of impeller should be balanced. Again the pump was found to be more efficient at blade angles less than 90°. The size of the centrifugal pump designed required that the angle of the blades should be less in order for the hydraulic efficiency to improve. The design and analysis methods are useful to generate performance and flow predictions. Therefore, the design can be optimised to reduce energy consumption, increase pump operating life and provide better system flexibility. 6.","motsi ephrey matlakala department of mechanical and industrial engineering technology university of johannesburg johannesburg, south africa motsiephrey@gmail.com daramy vandi von kallon department of mechanical and industrial engineering technology university of johannesburg johannesburg, south africa dkallon@uj.ac.za",
411,Design Of A Centrifugal Pump For Efficiency Optimization  A.R. Matiane,"a centrifugal pump is a rotodynamic pump using a rotating impeller to maximize the fluid pressure. a typical company in south africa using centrifugal pumps to supply water is the rand water and its pumping stations. they pump about 4.7 billion liters of drinking water from their booster stations per day through centrifugal pumps. the pump-set has two stages connected in series and is designed to deliver 200 megaliters per day (ml/day) at a generated head of 197 meters of water. in the course of the years, the pump's hydraulic output has dropped to a point where more energy is expended to provide the required head and flowrate. the reduction in centrifugal pump output causes increased energy consumption. the high consumption of energy is a direct result of the centrifugal pump not operating as required by the standards. in this project a new centrifugal pump for rand water is designed that to be more efficient in its water pumping performance as compared to existing designs. three concepts were selected for evaluation in order to choose best two concepts. appropriate calculations were done to obtain the desired dimensions in order to improve the performance of the pump.","centrifugal pumps, pump performance, pump design","A centrifugal pump was designed through calculations using appropriate equations to develop technical 3D drawings using Autodesk inventor. The designed centrifugal pump had an efficiency of 86% which requires an input power (Shaft power) of 835.90 kW to produce a discharge pressure and pressure head of 90 kPa and 35 m respectively. A normal and steady pressure distribution results were used to show the pump casing and the impeller are in good condition when the pump is running with the impeller at the given rotational speed. Cavitation will occur if the pressure is too low and this will damage the impeller, thus, reducing its life cycle. However, in this project to avoid cavitation the pump was designed to have a NPSH (Net Positive Suction Head) available that is greater than NPSH (Net Positive Suction Head) required. The results were taken in varying axis and cross sections for pressure distribution of centrifugal pump (Assembly of pump casing and impeller), pressure distribution of centrifugal pump impeller and velocity distribution of centrifugal pump (Assembly of pump casing and impeller). As expected, the pressure appears to be low at inlet when compared to the pressure at outlet. The pump casing and the impeller had a maximum pressure of 7.623 MPa and a minimum pressure of -2.092 MPa. The pressure at the inlet of the pump is -0.473 MPa. The outlet of the impeller has a pressure of 1.686 MPa. As expected, the velocity appears to be high at inlet when compared to the pressure at outlet. The velocity also appears to be relatively high at the rotating section of the pump, where the impeller is rotating. The simulation results of velocity distribution showed that the pump casing and the impeller has a maximum velocity of 212.6 m/s and a minimum pressure of 11.81 m/s. The velocity at the inlet of the pump is 35.44 m/s. The outlet of the pump has a pressure of 11.81 m/s. 7.","department of mechanical and industrial engineering technology university of johannesburg johannesburg, south africa arnoldmatiane@gmail.com daramy vandi von kallon department of mechanical and industrial engineering technology university of johannesburg johannesburg, south africa dkallon@uj.ac.za motsi ephrey matlakala department of mechanical and industrial engineering technology university of johannesburg johannesburg, south africa motsiephrey@gmail.com",

One of them is the impact felt by entrepreneurs in Indonesia who enter bankruptcy suddenly, but some have experienced an extraordinary increase. The Indonesian government has helped and made every effort aimed at boosting the country's economy. However, the Covid-19 pandemic has an impact from two sides, namely negative and positive; this needs to be addressed by the public and entrepreneurs to continue in its business. From the research results, it is said that some business entrepreneurs are still trying their best to maintain their business by following existing developments, such as most of them have turned online. They have followed the government's recommendations regarding the coronavirus protocol. Many have also changed their business type before they will experience enormous losses later, and the last, many innovations that emerged during this pandemic. All old and new entrepreneurs are trying to keep opening their businesses to fulfill their lives. However, it is not only the negative impact that businesspeople feel; they also find new business opportunities during a pandemic. As the study results, it was found that several business actors added their product variants or studied digital marketing strategies, which turned out to be able to develop their business and generate more profits than before. Also, several businesspeople change their marketing strategies or strategies in other company elements to adapt to the current situation and test their business resilience during the problems that occur. This research has limitations, as it is not discussed more broadly in Indonesian society and does not focus on new entrepreneurs. So, further research is suggested to examine the sample more broadly and focus on new entrepreneurs.

422,Optimization Of Overall Equipment Effectiveness Through  Lean And Total Productive Maintenance In A Cement Paper,"one of the most important measures in manufacturing industry is overall equipment effectiveness, commonly termed as oee, it also indicates the degree to which a manufacturing process is truly productive and serves as a general and inclusive measurement of how well a company's manufacturing operations are performing. optimization of oee factors provides significant impact to the organization through efficient operations, cost effectiveness, gaining competitive advantage in the market and to provide sustainable supply of products. optimization is providing sustainable solutions to the problems identified through root cause analysis through total productive maintenance or lean manufacturing methods or techniques towards the goal of zero to minimal wastage. with the applications of these methods the researcher was able to identify the critical issues and solved the issues affecting the overall equipment effectiveness of the subject company. the researcher was also able to propose a systematic roadmap to implement lean and tpm for the subject company that will ensure and sustain the efficiency and cost effectiveness of the organization.","sustainable, lean manufacturing","With the application of lean tools, problems were able to identify and corrected to attain the target performance of 95%. Throughout the process, it was highlighted the weakness of the organization in technical skills. Although the equipment availability (A), quality of the product (Q), and performance rate (P) are directly attributed to the performance of the equipment or the so-called six (6) big losses, people factor most often neglected in the unattained equipment also play a bigger role in these performances. People management is one of the key factors in the success of the organization. The use of lean tools such as standardization and poka-yoke will enable the workforce to enhance their skills while preventing committing mistakes. Autonomous maintenance will enable the workforce to enhance their skills in the operations of the equipment and basic maintenance of the equipment. With the proper guidance of Lean/TPM champions, this will enable the company to maintain the OEE target.

425,"Vulnerability To Hydrometeorological Hazards: A Barangay  Level Assessment For The Municipality Of Boac, Marinduque","the conduct of vulnerability assessments has helped government units and local communities to manage risks posed by natural disasters. this study focuses on the barangay level vulnerability assessment on the municipality of boac, the capital of marinduque province in the philippines. the province, being an island, is susceptible to various hydrometeorological hazards. the assessment was made to compute the vulnerability index of each barangay in the municipality. the indicators of exposure, sensitivity, and resilience were identified through various consultations and focus group discussions with the constituents, the local government units, and government agencies assigned on disaster management while the data of each indicator were lifted from the 2015 community based monitoring systems (cbms).using the method of equal weights, the computed indices indicate that about 73.77% of the barangays have moderate vulnerability while the remaining 26.23% were categorized as low vulnerability. using regression analysis, the indicators that are significant to the barangay’s vulnerability were also identified. these indicators include landslide exposure, no. of households with members who are pregnant/lactating, and no. of households with members who have experience or training on emergency response. the study also proved that increasing resiliency is an important factor to decrease the community’s vulnerability. this can be done by proper risk assessment, establishing clear evacuation protocols before and during disasters, and educating the vulnerable communities through proper information dissemination.","vulnerability, index method","This study focuses on assessing the vulnerability of barangays in the municipality of Boac, Marinduque with respect to the three (3) dimensions of vulnerability, i.e., exposure to hazards, sensitivity, and resiliency. The assessment was made to help the community minimize the danger and risks brought about by hydrometeorological hazards such typhoon, flood, and landslide. Using the index method of assessment with equal weights, the vulnerability index of each barangay in Boac was computed. The results showed that most barangays possess moderate vulnerability with 45 out of 61 barangays or 73.77% while the remaining 16 or 26.23% fall to low vulnerability category. The barangay of Tumagabok had the highest index value of 0.5535, while the Hinapulan and Mahinhin ranked 2nd and 3rd among the barangays with the highest index. The barangays with the lowest index values were Isok I (Pob.), Malusak (Pob.), Isok II Pob. (Kalamias) with index values of 0.3070, 0.3072, and 0.3279, respectively. For exposure, 55.74% has a category of very low, while 42.62% are under low exposure and 1.64% under moderate exposure. The barangays with the highest exposure index are Tumagabok with 0.1573, Maligaya with 0.1306 and Tabigue with 0.1296. The barangays with moderate sensitivity are Tanza, Cawit, and Mataas na Bayan (Pob.) with indices of 0.1450, 0.1410, and 0.1381 respectively. The percentage of barangays with very low sensitivity are 8.20%, low sensitivity with 86.89%, and 4.91% in moderate sensitivity. Those with very low sensitivity are Isok II (Pob.), Boi, and Balaring with indices ranging from 0.0560 to 0.0660. For resilience, 26.23% has very high resilience, 72.13 with low resilience, and 1.64% under moderate resilience. The barangays of Murallon, Mataas na Bayan (Pob.), and San Miguel (Pob.) have the lowest resilience with 0.1758, 0.2015, and 0.2027, respectively. While, the barangays with the highest resilience are Mahinhin with 0.2891, Tugos with 0.2836, and Tumagabok with 0.2814. The regression model identified that the significant indicators contributing to the barangays’ vulnerability index were all of the exposure indicators which are E1 (Materials used for the assembly of the walls), E2 (Materials used for the assembly of the roof), E3 (No. of the experienced typhoon), E4 (Households covered by the Marinduque flood susceptibility map), and E5 (No. of experienced landslides); sensitivity variables from demographic indicators which are S1 (No. of household residents 0.02 0.01 0.00 -0.01 -0.02 99.9 99 90 50 10 1 0.1 Residual Percent 0.50 0.45 0.40 0.35 0.30 0.03 0.02 0.01 0.00 -0.01 Fitted Value Residual 0.02 0.01 0.00 -0.01 20 15 10 5 0 Residual Frequency 60 55 50 45 40 35 30 25 20 15 10 5 1 0.03 0.02 0.01 0.00 -0.01 Observation Order Residual Normal Probability Plot Versus Fits Histogram Versus Order Residual Plots for Equal LVI Proceedings of the 11th Annual International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management Singapore, March 7-11, 2021","josephine d. german and ma. monica l. joven school of industrial engineering and engineering management mapua university, manila, philippines jdgerman@mapua.edu.ph; mmljoven@mymail.mapua.edu.ph dr. delia b. senoro school of civil, environmental, and geological engineering resiliency and sustainable development center mapúa university, manila, philippines dbsenoro@mapua.edu.ph engr. froilan p. ney school of graduate studies mapúa university, manila, philippines school of engineering marinduque state university, marinduque, philippines fpney@ mscmarinduque.edu.ph","References

426,Integration Of Total Productive Maintenance And Industry 4.0  To Increase The Productivity Of Nc Bore Machines In The,"improper maintenance and repair of machines can cause decreased productivity and machine effectiveness. the musical instrument industry is a manufacturing industry that is engaged in manufacturing musical instruments such as the piano. in the production process, many wood machines are used, such as the nc bore machine. machines that operate continuously are required to meet the targets that have been set with a high level of effectiveness. the problems in the production process are that there are a lot of breakdowns that occur in nc bore machines and a less than an optimal amount of production which results in a lack of the total machine effectiveness index (oee). to increase productivity, total productive maintenance (tpm) is implemented by analysis overall equipment effectiveness (oee). this research aims to increase the productivity of nc bore machines. this research resulted in an oee score of 87%, 94% machine availability, 93% performance rate, and 99% quality rate. this value meets world-class standards.","tpm, oee, industry 4.0, nc bore","Based on the results and discussion in the previous sub-section, it is known that to achieve the goals in the TPM strategy, many approaches are used. Some of the approaches taken include the implementation of 5S, education and training for operators, manualization of machine operations, application of sensors on machines as early detection of breakdown, this is in line with the implementation of industry 4.0 characteristics. Based on the above results, the following conclusions are drawn. The OEE value on the NC Bore machine increased from 75% to 87% or increased by 12%. Thus the OEE value on the NC Bore Machine meets world-class standards. • Availability of NC Bore Machines increased from 89% to 94% • Performance on NC Bore Machines increased from 88% to 93% • Quality on NC Bore machines increased from 96% to 99% • Based on the defect rate, the quality of NC Bore machines increased by 3% 6. Suggestion This research has several limitations, including that there has not been an overall analysis of the TPM pillars. The implementation of this TPM was not carried out along with a cost analysis. In future research, it can be expanded by discussing all the pillars of TPM and discussing aspects of maintenance costs, so that the company will know how much cost savings the company receives. 89% 88% 96% 75% 94% 93% 99% 87% Availability Performance Quality OEE Before After Proceedings of the 11th Annual International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management Singapore, March 7-11, 2021","musical instrument industry indra setiawan master of industrial enginering student universitas mercu buana meruya selatan no. 1 street, kembangan, jakarta, indonesia indra.setiawan.2022@gmailcom","References

428,Implementation Of A Knowledge Management Strategy:  Reflections And Critical Success Factors,"nowadays, knowledge is considered a key strategic resource for organizations, crucial for obtaining long-term sustainable competitive, and many organizations are making efforts toward the implementation of knowledge management (km) initiatives. although companies are increasingly competing based on their ability to effectively manage knowledge, there are still numerous challenges for organizations that intend to implement km practices. this paper presents the results of a case study conducted in a multinational company implementing a km initiative, describing the implementation approach and investigating the critical factors for its success. in general, the results indicate the importance of the people-processes-technology trio in the implementation of km, with greater focus on the organization and people, with some factors such as organizational culture, top management support and leadership, km strategy and performance measurement. it is expected that these results can contribute as a consultative tool to support the preparation of strategies in this area by organizations wishing to implement km initiatives.",,"Knowledge management is a complex and important activity, increasingly sought by organizations that want to improve processes and ensure the use of useful knowledge in order to gain long-term competitive advantage. This research aimed to study the implementation process of a KM strategy for a multinational organization, Company A, and to identify what were the critical factors for the success of the initiative. Company A decided to implement a Knowledge Academy to address the problem of critical knowledge loss, as it was spread throughout the organization and there were no formal methods of knowledge sharing between employees, including training programs. For the development of this project, it was necessary to define new roles, such as the creation of a specific team responsible for KM initiatives and the Steering Committee, as well as to make an analysis of the main areas of critical knowledge to be captured. Following a methodology to capture and share knowledge, the implementation of the Knowledge Academy contributed to build a knowledge transmission path according to the necessary skills of each function in Company A, ensure uniformity of knowledge and leverage knowledge to a variety of areas within the organization. They key elements of the initiative, as well as the implementation approach have been described and can help other organizations to prepare and implement a similar strategy. To date, this research has been able to confirm a number of CSFs of KM identified in the literature. In general, the results indicate the importance of the people-processes-technology trio in the implementation of the Knowledge Academy in Company A, with greater focus on the organization and people. In fact, people is the greatest driver of knowledge and it is essential to adopt mechanisms and procedures that support and motivate human resources to participate in these initiatives. This way, it was crucial to have a positive organizational culture and the involvement of top management to support the KM program. If people are not motivated and do not believe in the benefits of these practices, the project will surely fail. In addition, having a clear strategy for the project, aligned with the organizational strategy, and performance measures to monitor it, as well as a specialized team and knowledge owners, also contributed to the success of the project. Besides, the use of technology through collaborative tools was also crucial for the Knowledge Academy, facilitating the capture and sharing of knowledge. Considering the amount of information and the geographical distribution of sources in Company A, it becomes quite complicated to implement a KM strategy without the use of technology, since it strongly contributes to improving access to knowledge and collaboration among employees. However, technology cannot be seen as a single facilitator to KM, as it will never work by itself. Therefore, it serves as a support to people and processes involved, as perceived by Igbinovia & Ikenwe (2018). Although knowledge management is a very comprehensive area and there is no single integrated approach to implement KM that works for all organizations, it is expected that these results can contribute as a consultative tool to support the preparation of strategies in this area by organizations wishing to implement KM initiatives. In fact, considering the complexity of KM programs, a good practice for such organizations is to look at what other companies have done, their main results and what led to their success. In this way, after reflecting on their current state and the objectives they intend to achieve with KM, organizations can adapt a KM strategy that fits their reality.

MALL was an inspiring approach to transform the traditional environment into an active learning environment in the Mandarin classroom. This approach has responded to Ramsden's Theory 3, in which the teacher must provide the content in a more attractive manner that engages the student. The finding showed that all students want to continue to learn Mandarin at the next level. This learning method gave access to a wide variety of apps via a mobile phone, allowing learning everywhere and at all times. All students can complete their language tasks in a shorter time, record and load all videos more conveniently in the entire setting. The results showed that the majority of students learned and spoke through SWA and WBA. Therefore, this study seeks to improve students' performance through the MALL approach and enhance the researcher's pedagogical skills. Educators need to be alert with multi-tasking is limited, respect is encouraged, and students diversity. Their learning preference is different and unique. To involve and inspire students in language learning, an instructor needs to continuously find ways to stimulate various MALL learning activities that promote interests and encourage students to learn.","assisted language learning (mall) classes nurul ain chua, azza jauhar ahmad tajuddin, che hasniza che noh, mohd yusri ibrahim, roswati abdul rashid and mazlina ahmad, center for foundation and continuing education universiti malaysia terengganu 21030 kuala nerus, terengganu, malaysia ain.chua@umt.edu.my, azzajauhar@umt.edu.my, roswati@umt.edu.my, mazlinaahmad@umt.edu.my, goh ying soon universiti teknologi mara 54000 kuala lumpur, wilayah persekutuan kuala lumpur, malaysia gohyii41@tganu.uitm.edu.my jumadil saputra faculty of business, economics and social development universiti malaysia terengganu 21030 kuala nerus, terengganu, malaysia jumadil.saputra@umt.edu.my",

435,Performance Analysis Of Rss-Fingerprinting Localization  For Multi-Floor Environment Using Random Forest,"at present, there is a growing interest in the possibility of obtaining information about the location of an object in indoor environments. various algorithms have been developed for indoor local position systems. one of the most cost-effective choices is using the wlan infrastructure of wi-fi technology based on the received signal strength indicator (rssi). in this paper, the estimation of the indoor location of an object in a multi-floor environment using a random forest classifier is proposed, in which rssi is used as a metric to solve the position problem. experimental measurements were carried out on the first floor and the second floor of the main building of technological university (hmawbi), myanmar. rssi values from both 2.4 ghz and 5 ghz frequency bands are measured and used as features to build the rss fingerprint database. performance analyses are carried out and results present that using combined features from both 2.4 ghz and 5 ghz frequency bands improve the localization performance as trained random forest classifier model could increase the performance with extra features. in addition, the proposed research takes into consideration the effect of antenna orientation effect and performance improvements are highlighted with results.",random forest (rf),"In this paper, performance of RSS Fingerprinting positioning using the random forest classifier has been investigated for indoor location positioning. Performance improvement of using RSS features from both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz frequency bands and considering different antenna orientations are highlighted with several experimental results. RSS Fingerprinting positioning using combined frequency band achieves 9% higher accuracy than using a single 2.4 GHz frequency band for multi-floor indoor positioning. As well, considering antenna orientations could improve the localization performance by 10% than without considering antenna orientation. The execution rate of the proposed system is also consistent although there is an increased number of features. Further considerations to this research are to extend indoor positioning of multi-floor environment using other machine learning algorithms and neural network.","algorithm khaing myat thu#1 department of information technology (hmawbi) khaingmyatthu1@gmail.com nyein aye maung maung#2 department of computer engineering and information technology yangon technological university yangon, myanmar nyeinayemgmg@ytu.edu.mm",

437,Calculation Of The Timelife In Hdpe Pipe With A Crack.,"high density polyethylene has been widely used in marine and gas transportation, storm sewers, culverts and city drainage system. compared with other conventional pipes, it has its own advantages, such as, chemical corrosion resistance, durability, flexibility, easy joining and subsequent easy management and fitting. in this paper, and in order to forecast the remaining lifespan of a pipe enclosing a crack and subjected to internal pressure, it is essential the assessment of ki the stress intensity factor throughout the crack propagation. the finite element method is used to assess the values of the stress intensity factor of an axially oriented semi-elliptical crack located at the inner surface of an hdpe pipe. the crack configuration is described by the relative wall thickness (t/r), the relative crack depth (a/t) and the crack aspect ratio (a/c). the lifetimes presented are discussed in accordance to the crack size and the stress intensity factor in each case.","hdpe, crack, scg","The fracture mechanics is a good example to approach the life of HDPE pipes. Its main objective is to study the gravity of the defects on the macroscopic scale requiring the determination of the stress and deformation fields in the locality of the fissure. This study made it possible to evaluate the residual lifetime of an internal pressure pipe on the basis of the relation da/dt=AKIm. A finite element model of a pipe with an initial defect was suggested in order to calculate the stress intensity factor. A comparison of the stress intensity factor KI as a function of the normalized length of the crack (a/t) was established. We note that KI increases with increasing crack size, and becomes critical when the crack propagates more in the pipe wall. For predicting the lifetime of the pipe, assuming that the crack initiation time tinit is neglected and that the SCG occurs immediately after the pipe is loaded or pressurized. Under the present conditions presented (σ, T°C), the estimated lifetimes in the three cases treated are in good agreement with the recommendations dictated by the MRS (MRS : Minimum Required Strength) classification and which have a minimum lifetime of 50 years Acknowledgements The authors would like to thank the LR3MI members for fruitful discussions on the subject.

438,Utilization Of Machine Learning Techniques For Quality  Monitoring And Prediction,"product quality is a key factor for manufacturing companies to evaluate their production capability and increase their market competitiveness. today's manufacturing processes have become more complicated and usually equipped with smart sensors that collect a massive amount of data along the manufacturing chain. this chain consists of a multistage of manufacturing processes to produce complex products to satisfy customer requirements. in multistage manufacturing systems, many factors may have interactive and cumulative effects on the final product quality. the purpose of this research is to introduce an intelligent real-time quality monitoring framework capable of predicting and identifying the quality deviations for multistage manufacturing systems as early as possible to reduce wastes of time and resources. we used different unsupervised and supervised machine learning techniques such as principal component analysis, support vector machine, neural network and random forest to consider the accumulative effect of different workstations and to construct the quality monitoring model. we used a complex semiconductor manufacturing dataset to evaluate the performance of the proposed framework. the results show the capability of the proposed framework to improve the performance of the quality monitoring process in the multistage manufacturing systems and to reduce both type ӏ and type ӏӏ errors.","quality monitoring, quality prediction, industry 4.0","And Future Work In this research, we introduce an intelligent real-time quality monitoring framework capable of predicting and identifying the quality deviations for complex and high dimensional MMS as early as possible, especially at critical manufacturing stages. Our framework consists of two main phases: Phase I is the model building phase, which includes data collection and preprocessing, and quality prediction model building, while phase II includes monitoring the manufacturing process and updating the quality monitoring model to cover any new patterns and reduce the chance of misclassification. The results from applying the proposed framework on a complex dataset that contains 1567 instances and 590 features show the capability of the proposed framework to improve the performance of the quality monitoring process in multistage manufacturing systems. The average performance of all classification models increased in terms of sensitivity and specificity by 4.76% and 3.41%, respectively. The ANN algorithm performed the best between all the classification models. We successfully identified the most critical stages which can be used as quality checkpoints. For future work, we plan to improve the model performance by using more advanced feature selection, extraction and classification techniques. Moreover, we plan to use the critical stages as a quality checkpoint to provide the likelihood of producing non-conforming at the end of manufacturing chain products while the intermediate product passes through those stages.","mohamed ismail and ahmed el-assal department of mechanical engineering benha unversity benha 13518, qalubia, egypt mohamed.allam@bhit.bu.edu.eg, ahmed.el-assal@bhit.bu.edu.eg noha a. mostafa mechanical engineering department, the british university in egypt 11837, cairo, egypt industrial engineering department, zagazig university 44519, sharkia, egypt *corresponding author: noha.mostafa@bue.edu.eg; namostafa@eng.zu.edu.eg orcid: 0000-0002-6410-3848",

442,Resiliency Of Manufacturing Systems In The Industry 4.0 Era  – A Bibliometric Analysis,"organizations experience mainly two kinds of disturbances: ones due to natural events (such as earthquakes, hurricanes, etc.) or ones resulting from man-made events (such as theft, power failure, etc.). hence, many organizations strive to sustain resiliency to be able to deal with the various disturbances caused by different risks; and manufacturing systems are not any different. in manufacturing, disturbances could affect the outgoing product quality, the state of different machines, inventory levels, supply chains, or even entire factories. manufacturing systems that are not resilient enough to withstand short- and long-term disturbances may suffer from dire consequences, such as delayed product launches, unfulfilled orders, customer dissatisfaction, etc. due to the importance of having resilient manufacturing systems, the purpose of this work is to provide a bibliometric analysis of the recent research efforts on manufacturing systems resiliency in today’s industry 4.0 era. one of the findings of this work is that there is an increasing interest in this topic in the last five years.",industry 4.0,"Manufacturing systems, like any other organization, experience both natural and man-made disturbances occurring unexpectedly and adversely affecting their operational performance. Accordingly, the resiliency of manufacturing systems against such disturbances has become an important topic in both academia and practice; especially in today’s IoT and Industry 4.0 era. Hence, this work presented a bibliometric analysis through a three-phase review methodology on the recent publications in this field. From this analysis, it was observed that there is an increasing interest in this field during the last five years and the majority of the publications were from reputable academic journals. In addition, the top three countries with the most authors’ affiliation are Germany, the United States, and France. This work, despite its importance, is still in its preliminary stages and could be further developed in the future. One idea is to further extend the search space through backward and/or forward tracking of the considered publications. Another idea is to classify the reviewed publications according to their research area scope and research methodology used. This work has also the potential of allowing researchers to 1) identify the current state-of-the-art research areas within the field of manufacturing systems resiliency in the Industry 4.0 era and 2) highlight the existing research gaps for moving forward within this field.","ahmad e. elhabashy, sara el-breshy, and hadi fors production engineering department alexandria university alexandria, 21544, egypt ahmadelhabashy@alexu.edu.eg, eng-sara.mohamed1520@alexu.edu.eg, and hadifors@alexu.edu.eg asmaa harfoush school of mechanical, industrial, and manufacturing engineering oregon state university corvallis, or, 97331, usa harfousa@oregonstate.edu",
443,The Challenges Of Industrial Revolution 4.0: An Evidence  From Public Administration Ecology In Indonesia,"as predicted by experts, rin 4.0 will be an era that can determine an organisation's life and death, including government/state organisations. this research aims to determine the ecology of public administration in indonesia in the face of the industrial revolution 4.0. the formulation of the problem raised in this paper is how the challenges of the industrial revolution era 4.0 (rin.4.0) and how the ecology of indonesian public administration. the study's primary design is to present evidence and facts about public administration ecology in indonesia, which are then analysed to obtain a comprehensive conclusion. the study found that the challenges of the industrial revolution era 4.0 (rin.4.0) are about (1) the development of information technology and the increasingly critical demands of the public pushing for public administration reforms in all governance of public organisations. (2) the development of information technology and the public's increasingly critical demands encourage public administration reforms in all public organisation governance. (3) as the influence of rin 4.0, the demand for quality public services in the community is increasing rapidly, but the capacity of public organisations still limited; and (4) education in the field of public administration, both curriculum development, and in the method of learning, in general, is still conventional in its research. in summary, the results of a study on strategic conditions regarding public administration are the pillars of public administration development that greatly influence the implementation of public policies, both within the central government and local and even village governments.","ecology, globalisation","Based on and review as presented, finally, some notes need attention regarding the ecology of public administration in Indonesia facing the era of the Industrial Revolution 4.0 (RIN 4.0) as follows. The challenges of the Industrial Revolution Era 4.0 (RIN.4.0) are (1) the development of information technology and the increasingly critical demands of society; (2) public administration reforms in all governance of public organisations. (3) demands for quality public services in the community; and (4) education in public administration, both curriculum development and learning methods. The development of information technology and the increasingly critical demands of society have led to public administration reforms in public organisations' governance. Technological advances have formed a new world order with no knowledge of national boundaries that accelerates globalisation with the spirit of competition and free markets in various parts of the world and is filled with all regions of the country demanding increased national competitiveness. It also has implications on discipline and system of public administration, both in developing and developed countries. Meanwhile, some nations have succeeded in utilising technological advancements to improve quality and efficiency, especially in managing services and policies by utilising technology in public administration systems developing as Indonesia must work hard to catch up. It was realised that with the cultural transformation of apparatus resources, the response was still very low (especially in developing countries).It is evident in formulating public policies, creating conducive state government activities, and realising public officials' transparency and accountability. Demands for the need for quality public services in the community, mainly as an effect of RIN 4.0, are increasingly rapid. On the other hand, they are faced with the ability of public organisations that are still limited. This gap must be increased immediately so that the gap is not too far away. One of the urgent efforts to do is a total reform of the education system at the elementary, secondary, and tertiary levels. Human resources as human capital must continue to be improved in terms of their knowledge, skills, and attitude. Thus, it is necessary to develop Good Education Governance that involves the state/government, the business world, and the community in the management of education in Indonesia. Education in the field of public administration, both curriculum development and learning methods, is generally conventional. The study of the discipline and administration system has not been developed in an interdisciplinary manner. It has not been able to face various substantive problems that are the responsibility of the administration system. In the Industrial Revolution 4.0, the institution that organised education in the field of public administration should be able to implement a digital campus system. The development of all aspects of life that is globalising very rapidly will affect sooner or later on public administration. The role and function of public administration in all sectors of public organisations will be an obstacle in realising good governance if public administration is not able to respond optimally, according to the demands of the times. As an illustration in practice, several obstacles were found, including the system of checks and balances of state institutions has not been implemented optimally, effective law enforcement has not been implemented, cleansing money politics practices such as in eradicating collusion corruption and nepotism is still selective, the lack of commitment and competence in realising national values and national struggles in accordance with UUD 1945.","a. rina herawati, hardi warsono, teuku afrizal department of public administration faculty of social science and political science universitas diponegoro tembalang, semarang, jawa tengah 50275, indonesia rinahera1508@gmail.com, hardiwarsono@lecturer.undip.ac.id teukurian@lecturer.undip.ac.id jumadil saputra faculty of business, economics and social development universiti malaysia terengganu 21030 kuala nerus, terengganu, malaysia jumadil.saputra@umt.edu.my",
444,Green Technology For Extracting Coffee Oil And Biodiesel  Production: An Application Of Spent Coffee Ground,"spent coffee ground (scg) was studied as a potential source of oil feedstock for biodiesel production as an alternative waste utilization instead of disposed of as municipal waste. this study using microwave- assisted extraction (mae). the optimal condition of mae obtains of n-hexane (4v/v) as extraction solvent, microwave power 460 w, solvent to the material ratio eight ml/g, extraction temperature 72℃, and time 42 min. the oil yield of 24.70 % reaches under optimum conditions. free fatty acids (ffa) of the extracted oil are converted into fatty acid methyl ester (fame) by base-catalyzed esterification. the study investigates the effect of temperature, ffa ratio to methanol-cao solution, and reaction time either. with one step alkali-catalysed transesterification, oil conversion to methyl ester can be enhanced from approx. 42–75% by increasing the reaction time, the reaction temperature, and the methanol-cao/ffa ratio. however, a complete oil conversion can only achieve by utilizing a two-steps transesterification process. the results showed that 4.4 l of biodiesel was produced from 1 kg of spent coffee ground. as such, this study expected this study to lead to the paradigm shift in spent coffee ground management with the ultimate target of zero-solid discharge highlights. proceedings of the 11th annual international conference on industrial engineering and operations management singapore, march 7-11, 2021 © ieom society international 4905",,"In this study, extraction of coffee oil from a spent coffee ground powder was successfully extracted by using microwave-assisted extraction method. To obtain maximum results, the impact of several parameters was investigated such as microwave power, the ratio of material to the solvent and the duration of extraction. The results showed that the best condition required to achieve maximum yield 1.52% was the power of 600 W with material to solvent ratio 6:1, time of 8 min. Therefore, it can be concluded that the extraction of coffee oil from SCG with MAE is an efficient and efficient extraction method. The GCMS analysis showed that. Coffee oil contains high triglycerides and free fatty acid.

446,Tariqa Of  Sammaniyah Palembang In 1900-1945:  Struggle And Game Power Of The Tariqa Sammaniyah Scholars In,"this study aims to discuss the struggle of sammaniyah scholars in maintaining the existence of sammaniyah tariqa at the beginning and in the middle of the 20th century. the struggle of these scholars began since the dutch removed the islamic-malay poliltics from the neighborhood of palembang sultanate palace in 1824. although the dutch had left indonesia and there has been a change of power, apparently the struggle of islamic scholars to maintain the exposition of the order is still done. the method of study used in this research is qualitative with genealogical approaches, where researchers analyze the relationship of power built by the sammaniyah scholars in spreading islam and maintaining the teachings of orders. the different treatment experienced by the sammaniyah order has made the islamic scholars make a strategy so that they can endure the middle of the regime. establishing a power relationship with the power regim is one of the steps of sammaniyah scholars in maintaining the order through the process of islamization.","tariqa sammaniyah, palembang, regim power","There are two threats faced by the ulama of the Sammaniyah tarekat in Palembang in spreading the Sammaniyah tarekat, namely the threat that came from the Dutch colonialism and the threat that came from the reformists. The Dutch colonial dislike for the clerics of the Sammaniyah tarekat and Muslims in general when the Dutch colonialist abolished the Malay-Politics in Palembang. The trigger for this dislike was not only that trade in Palembang was controlled by Muslim merchants - both local and from the Middle East, the Sammaniyah tarekat movement was also a threat to the continuity of Dutch colonial rule in Palembang. Meanwhile, the threat that comes from the reformists is a form of threat that comes from Islamic reformers who try to destroy all forms of innovation that are not in accordance with the teachings of the Koran and Hadith. The threat would certainly affect the spread of the Sammaniyah tarekat in Palembang because if it was not faced, the Sammaniyah tarekat would disappear from Palembang. To deal with this, the Sammaniyah clerics took various methods so that the Sammaniyah tarekat in Palembang continued to develop. The political situation that developed at the beginning of the twentieth century required the clerics of the Sammaniyah tarekat to participate in the political situation that occurred at that time. The joining of the ulama of the Sammaniyah tarekat into NU was a way to defend Islamic teachings and the teachings of the Sammaniyah tarekat which were considered bid'ah among the reformists.","maintaining the existence of the tariqa sammaniyah rudy kurniawan ph.d candidate, graduate sociology in faculty of social and politic sciences, universitas brawijaya, malang, indonesia, rudykurniawan@fisip.unsri.ac.id darsono wisadirana, sanggar kanto, siti kholifah postgraduate lecturer in faculty of social and political sciences universitas brawijaya, indonesia darsono_wisa@ub.ac.id; sanggar.fisip@ub.ac.id; ifah_18@yahoo.com m chairul basrun umanailo universitas iqra buru, indonesia chairulbasrun@gmail.com",

460,Investigating The Features Of Indonesia Stock Price During  Covid-19 Pandemic: An Application Of Merton Jump,"the covid-19 pandemic has had a major impact on global financial problem increasingly erratic stock price movement, including in indonesia. in general terms, stock prices have some features that describe price movements. these features are jump, volatility smile, and leptokurtic. these features are obtained by modelling the stock price with the best model. this paper investigates the merton jump diffusion (mjd) model and implemented stock prices in indonesia to see if the model could capture some stock price features during the covid-19 pandemic. mjd model is built based on the black scholes model by adding a poisson jump process with the parameters are intantaneous expected return, volatility, jump intensity, mean, and standar deviation. the parameter values estimated by using the maximum likelihood estimation algorithm and computed using matlab. the indonesian stock price being modelled is 10 blue chips stocks during the covid-19 pandemic period 23/12/2019 –23/12/2020. the result shows that blue chips stocks in indonesia exhibit several jumps by jump intensities values. moment density of mjd reveals the presence of leptokurtic feature by excessive kurtosis and indicated volatility smile by skewness. it is found that the mjd model is suitable for modelling indonesia's stock prices during the covid-19 pandemic","jump, leptokurtic","In conclusion, the Indonesian Blue Chips stocks have several jump prices, which jump parameters results and the log- return. The probability density function shows that the stock has leptokurtic characteristics as evidenced by a kurtosis value that exceeds 3. It shows the abnormalities of stocks, namely the volatility smile feature as evidenced by positive and negative skewness values indicating stock returns are non-symmetrical. Therefore, the MJD model fits into Indonesia's Blue Chips share price data because it can detect stock features during the financial crisis caused by the Covid-19 Pandemic.","diffusion model dhea putri adriani, ratna herdiana and widowati faculty of science and mathematics universitas diponegoro tembalang, semarang, jawa tengah 50275, indonesia dheaadriani@student.undip.ac.id , ratnaherdiana@lecturer.undip.ac.id, widowati@lecturer.undip.ac.id teuku afrizal faculty of social science and political science universitas diponegoro tembalang, semarang, jawa tengah 50275, indonesia teukurian@lecturer.undip.ac.id jumadil saputra faculty of business, economics and social development universiti malaysia terengganu 21030 kuala nerus, terengganu, malaysia jumadil.saputra@umt.edu.my",
461,A Decision Process For The Applications Of Artificial  Intelligence In Sustainable Operations And Supply Chain,"artificial intelligence (ai) has a growing and wider presence in academic studies and this presence has affected many fields, such as business research, which has picked up on the subject, and ai is now researched from a more holistic perspective, with operations and supply chain management being recognised as one of the areas that is most likely to benefit from ai applications. in addition, many companies have pushed towards using ai in their supply chain processes in order to achieve sustainability. the influence of ai inevitably extends well beyond the production line. it refers to all business units involved in planning, manufacturing, transporting and selling goods. as a result, companies will need engineering business managers who are well-equipped with know-how of the technological changes that may affect their market and workplace in order to effectively navigate them. this paper proposes a framework that can be used as decision making tools, providing steps for practitioners to consider before and after implementing the ai techniques in their engineering businesses. the framework was developed considering the barriers, enablers and challenges of ai implementation.","operations, sustainability","This study has explored how AI might support smart and intelligent operations in multiple industrial sectors, with an ultimate goal to improve and attain sustainability. The study has reviewed 90 articles collected from journal databases. The journals have been classified based on their document type, year published, the research purpose, problem, AI technology, industry sector and its benefits, in order to carry out a descriptive analysis. It has also developed a thematic analysis of sustainability in the applications of AI in OSCM. Themes were proposed before undertaking the thematic analysis. The findings from the review indicated that some techniques have been used more widely than others among the many distinct AI techniques available. The results indicated that Artificial Neural Networks are the most prevalent AI tool, which are typically used to find complex patterns that cannot be identified by humans. The barriers, enablers and challenges that could be posed from implementing the AI were also presented. Most of the studies conducted presented similar challenges, that using AI in OSCM is difficult because most of the technologies were not fully developed and lacked an integrated framework. The review findings indicated that AI has vast potential to attain sustainability in OSCM, for instance, it could enhance productivity, provide better monitoring systems for waste management treatment, and could also minimise energy consumption thus leading to cost reduction. The decision- making process for an engineering business manager has been proposed in this study, which was based on the findings from the literature review. There are several steps and key factors to be considered by the engineering business manager before implementing the AI technique, as AI technology implementation is not only about the technology itself. It is important for success to consider the business case and apply the technology to it, rather than the other way round.

467,Enhancing Cyber Security In The Philippine Academe: A  Risk-Based It Project Assessment Approach,"cybersecurity devices such as anti-virus, intrusion detection, and prevention system, firewall, network access control, are reactive responses to cyber-attacks because it is based on the known signature. however, security analytics and security information, and event manager are devices, that can gather data about the historical behavior of attacks and correlate it to one another. the significance of this research is to precisely predict if an attack were about to happen, many industries only act if an attack was already happening inside their network or has done significant damages already to the business. this research would significantly help industries, to gain insights on the security events on their network. artificial intelligence can instantly predict and suggest if a person can potentially harm based on people's record of good behavior. this can be related to a computer’s normal pattern of behavior in the network and once an anomaly happens an unusual behavior can be detected. hence, the best application of artificial intelligence in cyber security is to put out a fire before it spread out, preventing data breaches that can cause damages to people's lives and material assets.","cybersecurity, data breaches","Cybersecurity devices such as anti-virus, intrusion detection, and prevention system, firewall, network access control, are reactive responses to cyber-attacks because it is based on the known signature. However, security analytics and security information, and event manager are devices, that can gather data about the historical behavior of attacks and correlate it to one another. To answer the research question, “what can effectively detect emerging cyber-attacks, and prevent them from happening”? The answer is the use of vulnerability index, which considers cost, risk, features and the different cases of cyber- attacks, coming up with vulnerability index that was formulated using risk assessment, nominal group techniques, with the corresponding configuration, from options 1 to 4 it can pre-empt cyber-attacks to avoid infrastructure damage. The vulnerability index, serves as a basis on how A.I. will treat the system, the higher the risk, based on the weakness of the system; The higher the safeguards are placed on the system with high vulnerability, this will be the basis for the decision making of the A.I. application. In return, enhancing the cyber-security in the Philippine Academe. Artificial Intelligence can give suggestions which accomplish objective 1; identifying the type and conditions of cyber- attacks, and learn based on historical data which is objective 2; to predict emerging cyber-attack, the more data it has, the better it becomes. A.I. can sort out thousands of logs prioritizing the most severe threat, according to the vulnerability index of the system, preventing infrastructure damage accomplish objective 3. 5. Recommendation Artificial Intelligence is a great tool to help humans do their jobs efficiently and effectively. It can help humans in decision-making with augmented reality, especially in situations that go beyond human capabilities, such as sorting through thousands of security event logs that were generated by various systems and network devices daily. Sorting through and correlating all security events logs are cumbersome and very time-consuming. Before deciding to act upon a cyber-attack can be too late, because the attacker has already infiltrated the network and created damages before noticing it. Being proactive and making quick decisions based on A.I. findings, is the key to prevent cybersecurity incidents from happening. If in case, all cyber-security measure fails for people, process and technology, business continuity and disaster recovery plan should always be included in the organization, as the last resort for the business to survive during negative events. Artificial Intelligence behavior analytics can be used primarily in premises security, malicious behavior can be monitored in airports, concerts, public gatherings, etc. In recent years the interest to improve the reliability of deception and hostile intentions detection techniques is related to the need of increasing the safety of citizens threatened with terrorist attacks. In particular, the Philippines government through its security agencies is looking for and financing research on modern lie detection techniques. There are different opinions on whether we can determine who is planning a hostile act merely by observing behavior. Some researchers are convinced that scientific methods of detecting hostile intentions, among others by detecting deception, can help to catch a terrorist and provide security. In China, a giant screen displays the faces of pedestrians who dared to jaywalk, unaware they were being watched. But it wasn’t police who caught them, it was street-side surveillance cameras equipped with the latest in facial recognition technology. For China’s government, that means not only being able to identify any of its 1.4 billion citizens within a matter of seconds but also having the ability to record an individual’s behavior to predict who might become a threat. Artificial Intelligence can instantly predict and suggest if a person can potentially harm based on people's record of good behavior. This can be related to a computer’s normal pattern of behavior in the network and once an anomaly happens an unusual behavior can be detected. Hence, the best application of Artificial Intelligence in Cyber Security is to put out a fire before it spread out, preventing data breaches that can cause damages to people's lives and material assets.","michael francis m. aquino and marvin i. noroña school of industrial engineering and engineering management mapúa university, manila, philippines mfmaquino@mapua.edu.ph, minorona@mapua.edu.ph",

Therefore, it can be concluded that the use of digital folktales improves vocabulary mastery of grade VII students of SMP Negeri 9 Buru. Based on the results and conclusions of the study, we recommend that English teachers; first, using multimedia- based digital folktales in learning vocabulary for junior high school students, because with this media, students can easily know, understand, and remember vocabulary. Second, always designing and implementing learning activities in the classroom with the support of a multimedia system in order to attract and motivate students in the teaching and learning process so that learning objectives can be achieved properly. Researchers teaching English as a foreign language should conduct more comprehensive research using digital folktales because the combination of stories, images, sounds, text, and animation in digital folktales can be an authentic language input in developing the ability to read and hear English as a foreign language.","abd. rahman, m chairul basrun umanailo, saidna zulfiqar bin-tahir universitas iqra buru, maluku, indonesia rahmanabd716@gmail.com, chairulbasrun@gmail.com, saidnazulfiqar@gmail.com amanan soleman saumur ekonomi syariah (mua'malah) pascasarjana iain ternate email.amanansoleman65@gmail.com syahrir ibnu fakultas ilmu budaya universitas khairun ternate, indonesia syahrir.ibnu@unkhair.ac.id abdul malik iskandar sociology education department of megarezky university amalikiskandar@universitasmegarezky.ac.id heksa biopsi puji hastuti kantor bahasa provinsi sulawesi tenggara heksa.biopsi@kemdikbud.go.id",

472,A Case Study On The Pre-Career Activities And Its Effects On  The Career Success Of College Graduates,"career success is the accomplishment of desirable work-related outcomes at any point in a person’s work experiences over time. this can be quantified objectively through salary, position, and promotion. the study investigated the relationship of college graduates’ involvement and performance in co-curricular and extra-curricular or collectively known as pre-career activities to their career success after graduating from college. furthermore, this study explored the personal and interactive skills acquired by students in pre-career activities that are key to advancing their careers. for data gathering, graduates from mapua university with a degree of bachelor of science in civil engineering and chemical engineering were asked to answer a questionnaire. numerical methods such as anova was used to assess whether pre-career activities have a significant effect on career success while regression analysis was utilized for determining the relationship between student leader development and professional career success. the results of the study showed that there is a significant difference (p < 0.05) between the career success of graduates with and without pre-career activities during their years of stay in the university. also, it is more probable that students joining such activities will obtain a personal skill such as determination and interactive skills such as teamwork and leadership. to conclude, one must be in the leader position rather than just a member in the academic organization to maximize the benefits of pre-career activities.","career success, personal skill","The results of the study show that grades have a very little or minimal effect on objective career success such as highest attained position, monthly salary, and length of promotion. Furthermore, the study suggests that there is a significant difference in the career success of graduates with and without pre-career activities. On average, the career success of graduates with pre-career activities are higher compared to those who did not participate. The significant pre-career activities that contribute to skills development are of academic co-curricular activities such as student councils and honor societies. It must be noted that to fully maximize the effect of pre-career activities, one must be in the leadership position rather than a member for years. The significant skills needed to advance careers are determination, problem solving skills, and commitment for personal skills while on the other hand, teamwork, leadership, and interpersonal skills for interactive skills. The greatest benefit of pre-career activities is the development of the interactive skills needed to advance one’s career.","john paul m. nieles, chols q. miso, and marvin i. noroña school of industrial engineering and engineering management mapúa university, manila, philippines jpmnieles@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, misochols@gmail.com, minorona@yahoo.com",

This paper suggests using RPA to provide improvement in the current state-of-the-art in each of the municipalities in Metro Manila. The decision-makers during a disaster require data in a timely, accurate, and convenient approach to decrease its damage and casualties. Surveillance of natural disaster zones using manned helicopters and airplanes is slow and limited by human endurance and physiological needs. An RPA will operate at a fraction of the cost of manned aircraft and give more endurance and persistent surveillance. Being resilient of the constituents in our municipality is not enough, RPA will increase the innovation in humanitarian operations of DRRMOs in Metro Manila. Logistic RPA's that can supply goods are not yet well matured but still can be considered. This solution will drastically change the information space of decision- makers and help to save more human lives.

It started with identifying the gaps in the current selection process thru an assessment. The assessment showed 5 gaps. Notable on these gaps were the absence of any MCDA tool and the traditional approached used as showed with Economical and Technical criteria only being considered as major criteria. The second objective is to ensure that sustainability will be a key goal. Environmental and Social criteria were added. This resulted in the selection process to be holistic. Finally, the proposed decision support tool was used. FAHP and FTOPSIS were utilized to calculate criteria weights and ranking scores respectively. Workshops thru MS teams were conducted with 8 experts who provided valuable inputs enabling this study to select the most sustainable WWT technology within the given criteria. Results verified that with appropriate tools to be used selection process will not be cost-driven but sustainability-driven.","using ahp and topsis with fuzzy sets nico bautista carlos and marvin i. noroña school of industrial engineering and engineering management mapua university, muralla st., intramuros, manila nbcarlos@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, minorona@mapua.edu.ph",
475,Preparedness Of Philippine Aviation In Implementing  Automatic Dependent Surveillance – Broadcast (Ads-B),"air transportation is challenged by the increasingly high-density airspace traffic, thus aviation being a very complex system is highly reliant on technology advancements to ensure the highest levels of safety. as aviation transitions from a ground-based system to a satellite-based system, a wide scale of system re-designing presents one of the biggest system engineering challenges to aviation organizations globally. countries in america and europe, faced with very high traffic density, have since been working on the preparation for this transition. the asia pacific region is in the same predicament, driven by a surging demand that will account for more than half of the new air passenger traffic forecast in the region, according to the latest edition of iata’s 20-year forecast from 2015 to 2035. this research aims to assess the preparedness of philippine aviation in automatic dependent surveillance – broadcast (ads-b) transition and to determine the key success factors to an eventual ads-b implementation, by way of benchmarking with the latest and more advanced us federal aviation authority (faa) and european union (eu) eurocontrol surveillance systems.","airspace capacity, aviation system","ADS-B would affect many system components and hence, the FAA safety certification process includes the aircraft, aircraft components, air traffic control systems, airports, aircraft operators, procedures, pilots, and air traffic controllers. These will be needed to complete safety requirements and will form part of the components needed in the adoption of ADS-B technology. Traffic density in the Philippines is still low and the installation of new radars with enhanced coverage area/volume throughout the continental airspace is more than sufficient to meet current separation. As radar is still the cost-effective solution at present and shortly, the possibility of reducing aircraft separation from 10NM up to 5NM is still possible. Hence, there is no urgency to introduce ADS-B in the near term. The period between now and the traffic forecast that will get close to New York/New Jersey statistics (sometime in 2030), can be used to fill the gaps and prepare for the implementation of ADS-B for the long term. The availability of ADS-B data from Tagaytay Radar recordings can be a useful means to monitor and evaluate ADS-B signals without forcing airspace users to equip nor incurring a lot of up-front cost in infrastructure. Also, at the same time, there will be no disruption in any part of the surveillance and ATM systems. The studies made and the implementation approach of FAA and Eurocontrol on ADS-B could then be adopted as appropriate to the intended application as a gauge in the evaluation of available ADS-B records and traffic profile from all other radars. Any further development in ADS-B avionics will not have an adverse impact on the Philippine surveillance system much less on cost. While the ADS-B technology matures, the Philippines will be in a better position to make a seamless transition as the cost will decrease and benefits will increase. CAAP can make use of the data recordings in Tagaytay Mode S radar. There are at least eight and a half (8.5) years of ADS-B data to process, evaluate, and analyze the population of airspace users’ equipage and performance. Obtain statistical data used for correlation with different safety- or security-related observations throughout those years. This may require high capacity analysis tools used in Europe or the U.S. The data structure in the ADS-B signal can give an idea of what data are needed in aircraft performance requirements and how it should be structured in a database for ADS-B operational certification of airspace users together with their fleet. Safety cases can be used to come up with a safety model. This safety model can, in turn, be a factor in determining the separation model, and consequently, the surveillance model can be determined as the operational concept is made clear. All these things will be contained in the regulation or rule on the ADS-B operational acceptance. Then the certification process can be designed. Option on SBAS requirement for radar performance equivalence can be that of Japan’s Multi-functional Transport Satellite augmentation system. This however would need to be part of the avionics design for the Asia Pacific region. Cost- benefit analysis together with the business case should be undertaken to give airspace users economic and business impact foresight. Appropriate changes should be carried out in the automation system of the air traffic controller.

477,A Capability Index For The Filipino Elderly Home Care: A  Community Based Approach,"in the view aging in place, the most suitable home care system will be of interest in a community-based approach that meets the basic needs and service requirements that ensured the well-being of senior citizens and/or elderly filipino. the study focuses only on home care concerns and factors in the philippine setting, lgu, and family-oriented practices as regards aging and elderly care. it is conducted in manila city-based communities/barangays and excluded province-based elderly care that is generally home-cantered due to the absence of accessibility and government attention in rural areas. the main objective of the study is to create a capability index in determining the type of elderly care system and to formulate community-based implementation platforms accordingly. manova and pearson correlation were effective tools in determining the impact between the current provisions factors and demographic variables involved to form the capability index in evaluating the current situation of the elderly and their capacities. the study also formulates a community-based platform to determine the type of elderly care system. through this, areas of weaknesses can be easily identified and facilitate the development of appropriate program measures that a community can consider enhancing the capabilities of the elderly in their reach.","aging in place, capability index","and Recommendation One of the key factors that the elderly need is an active living community that provide interactions and social environments such as family, friends, and neighbors. There are national laws on the elderly, from accessibility standards to setting up senior citizens’ centers, discounts on purchases, and providing pensions. The Philippine government, like any other country, has policies and programs to take care of the elderly and provide them the needs and support.

478,Scheduling Footwear Moulding Injection Machines For A  Long Time Horizon,"the paper deals with a relevant scheduling problem associated with moulding injection machines. a footwear company, equipped with advanced automation machinery, faces true difficulties in planning the injection equipment production. it is crucial to respect delivery times without disruptions. there are many conditions associated with footwear and technological issues to consider, such as the weekly demand for different models and sizes, which is major to satisfy them on time. the moulds for each size of a model and distinct available machines, with varying quantities of positions for the moulds, are other concerned matters. changeover times, which occur when changing moulds, are critical. stocks are also considered. the time horizon attains tens of weeks. we developed an integer optimisation model with the objectives of minimising both changeovers and stocks. that initial model underwent a few simplifications, acceptable from a strategic and technological point of view, due to the impossibility of reaching admissible solutions. the new version can solve the real dimension problems optimally, those that matter. the paper describes one case, and the solution obtained. the new approach followed, and the solutions obtained, are essential for the company, given the planning difficulties; moreover, the method may also be relevant for any footwear industry facing similar combinatorial optimisation problems.","scheduling, footwear, march 7-11","and Future Work Production with mould injection machines is one of the possible processes to manufacture footwear. In particular, it is used for technical and performance footwear. The company is equipped with advanced automation machinery. However, there is a need to plan production on that injection equipment to avoid delivery failures. But this is a critical and challenging problem. This paper investigated and solved such a scheduling problem, having as planning horizon tens of weeks. The problem's characteristics are: the demand for different models and sizes is defined weekly; each size of a model has its mould or moulds; some of these moulds are common among some models and sizes; there are distinct machines with different quantities of positions for the moulds. A new optimisation model to minimise the changeovers and stocks was developed, which seemed to best represent the situation under study. Nevertheless, it was impossible to attain the optimal solutions for the cases that matter in practice. Consequently, some simplifications understood by the company were performed, which did not compromise the solutions' viability and quality. In conclusion, the optimisation procedure could obtain good solutions, satisfying the weekly demand, for a long time horizon. The future work will start by focusing on the presented optimisation model and using an approximate method to solve it, based on Metaheuristics. In this way, we expect to avoid some taken simplifications.","parisa sadeghi, luís guardão and rui diogo rebelo inesc tec - technology and science campus da feup, rua dr. roberto frias, 4200-465 porto, portugal parisa.sadeghi@inesctec.pt, rui.d.rebelo@inesctec.pt josé soeiro ferreira inesc tec - technology and science and faculty of engineering, university of porto rua dr. roberto frias, 4200-465 porto, portugal jsf@inesctec.pt",
479,Situational Awareness In Indoor Emergency Response For    First Responders: A Bibliometric Approach,"firefighters are consistently acting as first responders in the event of a fire tragedy in a building. the us national fire protection association (nfpa) has described lost inside as a significant cause of trauma to firefighters. the us national institute for occupational safety and health (niosh) has also stated that disorientation and inability to locate victims lead to firefighters' death. during the establishment of fire emergency response operations, the development and use of situational awareness are necessary to help first responders better assess the indoor changing circumstances and make informed decisions. first responders often lack situational awareness capability to quickly assessing a building's layout upon initial entry. one of the challenges is to provide the real-time quickest route to the first responders regarding the disaster area. this paper offers a review of situation awareness in the first responders' indoor emergency response between 2010-2020. the review is based on the bibliometric analysis of publications retrieved from the scopus database. the review results aim to provide a knowledge base and overview of situational awareness for the decision-making process of first responders in indoor emergency response.","first responders, indoor navigation","This bibliometric analysis aims to detect situational awareness for first responders in an indoor emergency. The Scopus database has found 50 bibliographical documents that enable the current state and trends of the topic to be reviewed and visualized. However, more than 90% of the corresponding documents have been published since 2013, and the first document was found in 2007. This trend shows how this new field of research was established. Furthermore, this topic is indeed multidisciplinary and covers both engineering and the environment. From the analysis, it can be seen that first responders' situational awareness in indoor emergencies is not getting enough attention from researchers. Existing research is more on the technology used such as VLC which is the strongest cluster. Also, radio frequency signals in cluster 2 are related to firefighting rescue tasks and the technology and infrastructure used. Meanwhile, based on the citation count, the indoor positioning system gets the highest number of citations than others, including situational awareness.","asep id hadiana, safiza suhana kamal baharin and zahriah othman center of advanced computing technology (cact), faculty of information and communication technology, universiti teknikal malaysia melaka melaka, malaysia p031910031@student.utem.edu.my, safiza@utem.edu.my, zahriah@utem.edu.my",
480,Impacts Of Digital Technologies On Supply Chain  Performance: A System Dynamics Approach,"the advent of industry 4.0 and associated digital technologies makes it possible to share information and access data real-time. such a capability needs to be investigated in the supply chain management (scm) to study the joint impacts of digital technologies on transforming sc members’ behavior. in this paper, cloud computing, internet of things, and big data analytics have been selected due to their relevant effects on real-time information sharing within different sc echelons rather than inside one echelon. moreover, the implementation of these technologies in real sc requires high investments. also, due to the increased complexity of the sc after applying these technologies, their impacts on sc behavior and performance should be determined precisely. this paper proposes simulation as a cost- effective and comprehensive method to investigate how digital technologies affect sc performance. a three echelon manufacturing sc has been simulated by using system dynamics (sd) modeling under different scenarios in both traditional and digital scm. the results reveal a significant improvement of sc performance, in terms of inventory level and cost as well as order fulfillment ratio, in digital scs compared to traditional scs. future research will further develop the model by validating the simulation results with real cases from the industry.","supply chain, performance, system dynamics","Industry 4.0 is a significant revolution that covers a wide range of digital technologies such as Artificial Intelligence, Cyber-Physical Systems, RFID technology, IoT, CC, BDA, and Advanced Robotics. The concept of Industry 4.0 transforms digital businesses in all industries and sectors. In this context, SC is one of the emphasized fields of research. The traditional SCs need to metamorphose quickly by implementing digital technologies to survive in rapidly changing markets. However, a limited number of papers have been focused on the importance of assessing the Industry 4.0 transition within an SC network perspective, and the impact of different digital technologies on each partner of the SC. Therefore, the present study contributes to close such a gap by discussing the key effects of CC, IoT, and BDA technologies within the SC network on a dynamic basis. The complexity of SC is increased significantly by applying CC, IoT, and BDA. Moreover, the implementation of these technologies needs a considerable amount of investment. Hence, simulation methods might assist the evaluation of these changes in a cost-effective and efficient manner. In this regard, to find the answer to the first research question posed in the present work, SD modeling helps academicians and practitioners to analyze the possible impacts of the new complex SC structure resulting from the adoption of digital technologies under different scenarios. In particular, academicians can study the advantages of a digitalized SC on its members and how it changes their behavior, as well as the criteria that could be adopted to improve SC performance. For practitioners, this work offers a valuable approach to evaluate the above mentioned impacts and to assist them in making decisions about the investment in SC digitalization. To answer the second research question, the main outcomes of this study are as follows. The proposed digital SC model has shown improved service level, inventory cost, inventory level, and inventory gap for all the members of the SC compared to traditional configuration. Thus, it can be concluded that implementing digital technologies in SCs has a great impact on making them more integrated. Additionally, it increases transparency and collaboration among chain members leading to more strong relationships. Like all research, this paper has some limitations. First of all, in the present SD model only the operational costs have been considered, and the impact of the initial investment of these technologies has not been addressed. Additionally, there is no real data from industries to validate the results of the SD model. Moreover, in this paper, just the three Industry 4.0 technologies more promising to stimulate real time information sharing and connection among SC members have been considered. Finally, in the current SD model the impact of combination of these technologies on the sustainability issues throughout the SC has not been focused on. Hence, future research can use real data to validate the results and assess the performance of the present model. Moreover, by the development of other technologies such as Blockchain and Additive Manufacturing, it could be possible to add those technologies to the investigated ones and study their impacts in combination with each other on SCM s. Also, future research can study the amount of initial investment for each technology to investigate its impact on the behavior of SC members. Besides, the evaluation of the influence of the present model on the sustainability issues can be one of the interesting directions for the development of the current work. For instance, some criteria could be added for the effect of the present model on human resources as the social dimension for sustainability issues.","abror hoshimova,b, mahsa mahdavisharifa*, anna c. caglianoa a department of management and production engineering, politecnico di torino, corso duca degli abruzzi 24, 10129 - torino – italy b department of aerospace and mechanical engineering, turin polytechnic university in tashkent, kichik khalka yuli st.17, 100095 – tashkent - uzbekistan abror.hoshimov@polito.it, mahsa.mahdavisharif@polito.it, anna.cagliano@polito.it",

First, Covid-19 pandemic is the major limitation and lead to low response rate or returned in the study. E-mailing and phone call is the only method used by researcher for data collection along 2 months survey period. Also, the respondent who asked for answer the survey assumed that was a scam and certain respondent refuse to answer the survey due to them tight by their company rules. 6.2 Recommendation for Future Research Future research is recommended to open the study area by involving others state within Malaysia as well as others sector instead of specified only Selangor manufacturing industries.

483,Developing Performance Measurement Tool For Slow-Onset  Humanitarian Supply Chain Operation,"the aim of this paper is to propose a conceptual performance measurement framework that can efficiently assess and evaluate the supply chain operation of school-meal programs (i.e. one of the focused slow-onset humanitarian aid operations by large humanitarian organizations). such framework is derived from the well-known supply chain operational reference (scor) model. numerous studies have applied the scor models to evaluate and enhance the performances of sudden-onset humanitarian relief operations, while application of the scor model on slow-onset humanitarian supply chain operation is scarce. since the designs for operations of the sudden-onset and slow-onset disasters differ from one another, the scor application needs to be adapted. this paper is among the first to explore the applicability of the scor model on slow-onset humanitarian supply chains. the proposed conceptual framework identifies the scope and content of the school-meal supply chain. it also visualizes process configuration, where different stakeholders, processes, and flows are comprised. the conceptual framework serves as an initial stage of our full development of the scor model and its detailed performance metrics to evaluate the school-meal supply chain. over the long-run, we aim at delivering a practical performance measurement tool to assist humanitarian logisticians in improving their supply chains.",,"This paper describes the application of the SCOR model on the SMP. The SMP is a long-term humanitarian aid operation to alleviate the suffering from slow-onset disasters. Since the design for humanitarian operations of slow- onset disasters is different from those of sudden-onset disasters, the SCOR framework and its applications need to be reconstructed. Over the long-run, we aim at developing the practical performance measurements based on SCOR process","narath bhusiri help logistics asia singapore 247671, singapore narath.bhusiri@kuehne-stiftung.org huay ling tay school of business, singapore university of social sciences singapore hltay@suss.edu.sg","References

484,Online Social Networks As Supporting Evidence For Digital  Forensic Investigation: A Revised Model,"in line with the increasing significance of technology today, the use of digital technology in digital forensic investigation has increased as well. the effect is that many investigations that require the expertise of digital forensics are unable be completed timely by law enforcement agencies around the world. being consistent with the use of online social media which is the focus of the world nowadays, too many incidents of digital and physical crime have been linked to it. therefore, a digital forensic model specifically for online social networks needs to be developed to obtain the best evidence and investigation results. a literature review related to digital forensic, models that have been developed in digital forensic and online social network has been conducted in this study. the results found that most studies involve general investigations and processes that overlap with each other. moreover, there is no model yet to formulate a systemic investigation in the online social network. to overcome this problem, we have developed a standard model for digital forensic investigation of online social networks in this study. this model combines some of the models that have been developed before and added some new activities that are appropriate to the investigation.","cybercrimes, digital evidence",,"norulzahrah m. zainudin, nor asiakin hasbullah, muslihah wook, suzaimah ramli and noor afiza mat razali department of computer science, national defence university malaysia kuala lumpur, malaysia norulzahrah@upnm.edu.my, asiakin@upnm.edu.my, muslihah@upnm.edu.my, suzaimah@upnm.edu.my, noorafiza@upnm.edu.my","References

485,A Genetic Algorithm Approach For Scheduling Jobs On  Identical Parallel Machines,"scheduling is an essential function in production management. scheduling determines what is going to be made, when, where and with what resources. parallel machines scheduling problems have many industrial applications. this paper presents a hybrid approach using a genetic algorithm to investigate the identical parallel machine scheduling problem with an objective to minimize the tardiness penalty cost. a numerical example is presented to demonstrate the approach.","parallel machines, reduce inventory","In this paper, a genetic algorithm approach is presented to solve the identical parallel machine scheduling problem. The objective is to minimize the total penalty cost, which includes earliness as well as tardiness penalty cost. The hybrid approach involving the genetic algorithm combined with backward-forward heuristic is used for obtaining the near optimal solution to the problem. In future, the performance of the genetic algorithm for different crossover, mutation, etc. can be investigated and also compared with other metaherustic approaches. The problem complexities like batch splitting, sequence dependent set ups, etc can be explored. Also, the algorithm can be used for developing the integrated approach between production scheduling and maintenance for parallel machine problem.

489,Innovative Disassembly Sequence Applied To A Virtual  Mechanical Reducer,"the life of industrial products is getting shorter due to the rapid evolution of technologies. because of that, the creation of models that are interested in last part of the product’s life are becoming extremely relevant. in recent years, many investments have been made in the recycling of raw materials and the reuse of end-of-life (eol) products in order to reduce the waste of resources. strategies of design for environment (dfe) have been searched and, for this reason, the design for disassembly (dfd) has become a fundamental phase in the product life cycle with the subsequent creation of design techniques aimed precisely at disassembly. using this methodology, the designer can study and plan the optimal sequence which should be based on countless factors and criteria because there is not a straightforward path or a single combination of operations to follow. this paper describes and compares multiple disassembly methods based on minimum disassembly time with reference to a worm gear reducer. in particular, the component was made entirely on cad (solidworks) and the sequences were applied in a virtual environment. in this way, it was possible to evaluate different algorithms and obtain the optimal disassembly sequence that minimize the overall disassembly time.","disassembly, virtual reality, cad, sequence",", a clear grouping of the methodology related to their principles and their field of application should be performed to simplify the analysis. In this paper, the choose of two comparable methodology was done aiming this result. 6. Conclusion The study of the two methods reported different results for planning an optimal sequence. The first method used appears to be more immediate and simpler in application, but it may be too long and laborious for products with a large number of components since it needs the definition of various large matrices. This algorithm obtained a sequence that can be developed in 741.8 seconds, which turns out to be a longer time than the one obtained with the second methodology. It is considered appropriate, however, that the first study allows less simplification of the product leading to a simple selective disassembly process which therefore provides less chance of error in the implementation of the process itself.

492,Application Of Quick Scan Technique To Increase  Productivity In Garment Manufacturing Industry,"the quick scan technique has been pioneered by the cardiff logistics system dynamic group (lsdg) in collaboration with two of their industrial research partners, enables a heath check to be undertaken on a supply chain to identify and rank areas where improvement would yield most value. one of the main types of product produced by the company is long sleeves shirt. the purpose of the quick scan method is to understand and inspect the related raw materials, cost, and resources. in addition, this research identifies the advantages and disadvantages of using the recommended “quick hit” for process improvement in applying with the short-term and long-term strategy. according to the preliminary finding, the one of the most important factors in the supply chain. furthermore, production analysis was undertaken in conjunction with value stream mapping. it was found that several non-value- added activities was presence in the production flow. the application of ecrs was applied to eliminate and reduce unnecessary process and to re-integrate production flow. finally, the advantages and disadvantages of applying quick scan was discussed which offers a new dimension of diagnosing supply chain activities within the garment manufacturing plant in thailand and ways it can compete with domestic and global market. keyword quick scan, value stream mapping, garment industry, thailand 1. introduction at present, business in small and medium industries plays an important role in thai economic system in various aspects. informal small industrial enterprises or enterprises with single owners are regarded as small and medium enterprises (smes). the number of these enterprises is around 540,000 – 720,000 enterprises i.e. 90% of smes so these enterprises provide a large source of employment in thailand. on the other hand, textile and garment industry is also important for thai economy in terms of employment and export. it is a manufacturing industry from upstream to downstream in 3 types namely; upstream includes industry in natural and synthetic fibers; midstream includes industry in spinning, woven and knitted fabrics, bleaching, dyeing, and printing; and downstream includes industry in finished production. proceedings of the 11th annual international conference on industrial engineering and operations management singapore, march 7-11, 2021 © ieom society international 5414",,"Application of Quick Scan technique in garment industry It helps case studies companies to understand the problem and the cause. Due to the delay in delivery from a total of 25 days of work, work can be reduced to only 16 days. That reduction of work has adopted Quick Scan techniques for finding the cause and solving. Together with the use of value stream mapping and ECRS, it is a tool that provides a clear view of wastes in the manufacturing process. Because the stream of value analysis must be analyzed in the present and future state, in line with Quick Scan that can be formulated in the medium term. The reasons for delivery delays found from the study are for several reasons, such as inefficient production planning problems. Complicated production planning Including the import of raw materials which affect the production within the company. The lack of technology to help communicate within the organization. Causing communication delays and each department does not have a standard or a strict requirement. Which will give wrong communication or errors in operations The benefit of the Quick Scan application in this industry is that it gives the company a clear overview of the organization. Clearly see the problems in the processes And can act quickly to fix And does not affect the production process As we deliver faster, the company can accept more orders.

493,Impact Of Covid-19 On The U.S. Energy Production,"the covid-19 pandemic impacts exceed the world's imagination to go beyond health-related issues to impact every single aspect of our lives, including how we produce and consume energy daily. this research aims to provide an in-depth analysis of the impacts of the covid-19 pandemic on renewable and non-renewable energy production. the study selects the united states (u.s.) due to 2020 energy data readiness at the time of the study. the u.s. energy data is mainly collected from the u.s. energy information administration (eia) from january to july 2018 to 2020, and august 2019 and 2020.. the data is analysed by thoroughly studying the energy value variations month-by-month. the study outcomes show that, as a result of the covid-19 lockdown and restrictions on people's mobility and activities, non-renewable energy has a drastic decline, while renewable energy has significant growth. the residential sector's energy consumption notably increases with the lockdown's imposition, while the other sectors decrease. the prices of fossil fuels are slightly affected by the pandemic, where the maximum drop in prices is approximately $24.64 for petroleum liquids.","energy production, energy consumption, fossil fuel costs, covid-19 impacts","This research paper examines the impacts of the novel coronavirus on energy production, energy consumption by sector, and fossil fuel costs. The study uses USA energy data collected from EIA, for the first seven months of 2018 to 2020, and August 2019 and 2020's fuel prices. The study outcomes show that the lockdown and restrictions on the population's mobility and activities as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic have prominent impacts on energy. The overall U.S. non-renewable energy production drops in 2020 to be even less than 2018's production at some points. Nonetheless, the production of renewable energy production increases by more than 100% of the previous years' production. That is due to the various renewable energy projects completed just before the pandemic.

4. Results and Discussion 
 
A preliminary empirical study involving 40 respondents has been conducted. It took a case study at a popular 
coworking space office and service in Indonesia. First step, through purposive sampling using online survey, the basic 
psychological needs of the customers were exploited and identified. It was found and finalized 19 coworking space 
service attributes, and refined to be 12 attributes after Kano’s categorization filtering process. The Kano’s 
categorization focussed on both attractive [A] and one-dimensional [O] performance. Kano’s attractive [A] is 
something not expected by the customer, but if it is fulfilled then the customer will be delighted. It refers to the 
unspoken needs of customer. Kano’s one-dimensional [O] is linearly-correlated level of fulfilment and satisfaction. It 
means that more fulfilment of capacity for the attributes will increase the satisfaction level."

507,Design And Fabrication Of Efficient Electromagnetic Braking  System For Bangladesh Railway: A Prototype Approach,electromagnetic brake is a new and revolutionary concept. electromagnetic braking system is a modern technology braking system used in light motor & heavy motor vehicles. the purpose of this research work is to develop a concept of designing and fabricating an electromagnetic braking system for bangladesh railway which can be used in lieu of existing frictional braking system. the methodology is based on creating a magnetic field on the heads of e-shape core through electricity and attaching circular ferromagnetic material parts under every train carriages. this created magnetic field penetrates train wheels and circular ferromagnetic parts to steadily reduce train motion. this research work finds the proposed electromagnetic braking system reliable and efficacious. the proposed electromagnetic braking system is found to be efficacious for both high and low speed train. this paper presents the implementation of electromagnetic braking system through a prototype.,"e-shape core, reliable","The complete idea and research work of designing and fabricating of electromagnetic train braking system was carried out considering the existing drawbacks of conventional frictional braking system of Bangladesh railway. Though many developed countries are moving forward with the advanced technology in train braking system, Bangladesh railway completely rely on outdated braking system policy. This research work will hopefully be a guidelines to improve the existing braking system of Bangladesh train. The purpose in this research work was to generate and apply an amount of magnetic force in a form of magnetic flux into train wheels and circular ferromagnetic material parts which will be sufficient to resist the kinetic energy of train and eventually stop the train. This purpose can be proceeded either by controlling current flow directly or by maintaining air gap between circular ferromagnetic material parts and middle head of E-shaped electromagnet. Due to some technical limitations, this research work of designing and fabricating electro-magnetic braking system followed the procedure of controlling current flow directly to vary magnetic flux according to the kinetic energy of train. The other method of maintaining air gap for the design of electro-magnetic braking system can be implemented in the further future.","raise uddin chowdhury, rafat mahmud hridoy, md. rafiquzzaman, aftab uddin sifat department of industrial engineering and management khulna university of engineering & technology raiseipe@gmail.com, rafathridoy1@iem.kuet.ac.bd, rafiq123@iem.kuet.ac.bd md. norozzaman jiko department of electrical and electronic engineering khulna university of engineering & technology",

The emergence of financial technology began to replace cash transactions. Economically, transactions without using cash can create efficiency in the economy. This study aims to develop pre-existing knowledge. Researchers examine the experience of users using digital payment services. Using this research, service providers can improve their digital payment services; entrepreneurs can develop transaction methods to increase income. Consumers can get the maximum benefit from using this technology. Other researchers can also use this research as a basis for further study. Using data analysis conclusion, researchers can deduce all factors which are satisfying users. These factors are the convenience of digital payment services, a sense of security, offer promos that benefit users, and follow prevailing trends. There are some drawbacks in services that need to be improved from a user's point of view. They implied that those services are often facing problems with networks. The user trust in platform security from an attacker is low. The user thought that supporting facilities and infrastructure are still inadequate. Platform service does not facilitate the elderly. Some users felt that some policies in fees and balances are burdensome.

It was followed by Bank Syariah Mandiri with 0.60% and 7.31% respectively in original and modified DuPont models. This research found that Bank BNI Syariah had the highest Return on Assets and Return on Equity which showed that the Bank had been running efficiently. BNI Syariah could manage their assets productively while maintaining the efficiency of the Bank. Merger blended all banks' performance. BNI Syariah was in the worse off position since the performance of merger bank was less than standalone BNI Syariah Ratios. For other banks, the merger would be favourable to leverage their financial performance.","mahdawi, triyono department of economic universitas trisakti grogol, 11440, jakarta barat, indonesia mahdawi1601@gmail.com, ttriyono@gmail.com sarman sinaga faculty of business and economics universitas darma agung petisa hulu, medan baru, 20153 sumatera utara, indonesia sarmansinaga17@gmail.com daniel collyn, rika surianto zalukhu sekolah tinggi ilmu ekonomi bina karya tebing tinggi padang hulu, tebing tinggi, 20631 sumatera utara, indonesia daniel.collyn@gmail.com, rikazalukhu@yahoo.com jumadil saputra faculty of business, economics and social development universiti malaysia terengganu 21030 kuala nerus, terengganu, malaysia jumadil.saputra@umt.edu.my rico nur ilham faculty of business and economics universitas malikussaleh blang pulo, muara satu, aceh utara, 24355 aceh, indonesia riconurilham@unimal.ac.id syawal harianto politeknik negeri lhokseumawe buketrata, blang mangat, 24301 kota lhokseumawe, aceh 24301 syawalhariato@pnl.ac.id",

As PPE was utilized at an increased rate, and issues with the supply chain consecutively arose. Various healthcare facilities throughout Massachusetts and the Northeast reported a shortage in PPE resulting in staff having to re-utilize supplies such as N-95 masks, and face-shields. Additionally, there were various issues in communication & procedural inconsistencies as healthcare facilities struggled to provide optimal care to affected patients while simultaneously working to decrease risk of potential outbreaks (Fig. 1). As displayed by Figure 1, various departments and facilities both on the regional and national level are involved and impacted in a joint effort to contain the virus. Figure 1: Departments involved with affected COVID-19 patients. To obtain a clearer insight into the various issues in healthcare facilities brought upon by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, an online survey was conducted to several front-line Boston Medical Center (BMC) hospital staff. This survey contained various questions pertaining to complaints and the procedural/supply chain issues brought about by the pandemic. This data was then analyzed, a pareto chart was created to adequately display the results of this study [8].

530,A Non-Disruptive Ecological Innovation On Concrete Block  Manufacturing: A Product Viability Study For The Philippine,"the construction industry plays a significant role in the national economy. in the philippines, there are very limited research studies involving the use of waste materials as an additional component in producing chb. other asian nations such as hongkong and taiwan have been efficiently using waste materials as a component of their chb. the current study has shown that a mixture of chb consisting of 3% rubber waste, in terms of its overall volume, yields the best results, both in terms of its specification and its costs. these results were also backed up by other tests in which it had shown in the one-way anova testing that there is a significant difference in results for each different mixture. this means that the waste materials added to the mixtures had a significant effect on the end product. the cost-benefit and value analyses yielded the positive ecological benefits and advantage of innovatively using waste materials as input to chb manufacture, a breakthrough in the philippine construction industry.",one-way anova,"The results of the study have shown that the eco-CHB are all viable and can be used in the Philippine construction industry. It was just a matter of which among all the tested mixtures is the most optimal for use, which was also discovered through several assessments considering specific criteria. The data gathered from the assessment have shown that a mixture of CHB consisting of 3% rubber waste, in terms of its overall volume, yields the best results, both in terms of its specification and its costs. These results were also backed up by other tests in which it had shown in the one-way ANOVA testing that there is a significant difference in results for each different mixture. This means that the waste materials added to the mixtures had a significant effect on the end product. The cost-benefit analysis also made clear that even though the cost increases due to added raw materials, the increase in the benefits it provides compensates for how much the increase in cost was. This also means that manufacturers of these eco-CHBs can increase the selling price due to its added benefits. Therefore, the primary hypothesis of the study based on related studies from different countries can now be accepted, and possibly implemented in the Philippine construction industry setting.","construction industry ephraim ryan joya, arnel buan jr., and marvin i. norońa school of industrial engineering and engineering management mapúa university, manila, philippines rembjoya@gmail.com, buanarneljr@gmail.com, minorona@yahoo.com",
531,Exploring The Approaches And Strategies Of Upgrading  Informal Settlements: Learning From Policy And Practice,"access to “adequate housing remains a big challenge in south africa, despite efforts since 1994 to deliver affordable housing to about 2.3million poor households through project-linked housing subsidy schemes. the current housing backlog in south africa stands at 2.1million households, and approximately 1.2million of these families live in informal settlements under conditions which pose serious threats to their health, safety and security. against this backdrop, the government introduced ground- breaking housing policy reforms in 2004, which included a programme devoted to the upgrading of informal settlements.” the new initiative, crowned as the “upgrading of informal settlements programme” (uisp), had the objectives to “eradicate” all informal settlements by 2014. with increased urbanisation, cities “become more challenged by the influx of people, which puts pressure on service delivery and infrastructure. chapter 2 of the bill of rights section 24 states that; “everyone has a right to the environment that is not harmful to their health or well-being and to have their environment protected for the benefits of the present and future generations” (republic of south africa constitution, 1996). consequently, this study aims to explore the approaches and strategies of upgrading informal settlements: learning from policy and practice in the city of ekurhuleni. it seeks to identify and flesh out the key policy gaps, in order to inform further policy learning. this study adopts relevant information from the qualitative and quantitative research approach. it applies a case study research design, using information from books, journal articles, national policy documents, publications and news reports, as well as internet sources. data were collected through questionnaires (city officials responsible for the uisp and policy implementation, and ngos personnel assisting within the uisp in the city of ekurhuleni), structured in-depth interviews, with key informants from the city of ekurhuleni (town planners and ngos officials responsible for uisp) together with observations, map surveys and photographic surveys of the upgraded settlements. the findings pinpoint the existence of comprehensive national legislative and policy frameworks in support of the slum upgrading initiative. however, the evidence suggests that the goal of slum eradication is still farfetched, due to several problems and challenges. the identified an apparent gap between the policy rhetoric, and the reality of implementation, which is characterised by notable inconsistencies, tensions, and problems. these have hindered the programme’s ability to make realistic improvements in the lives of slum dwellers.",(developing,"gives guidelines on what can be done to address the prevailing challenges.

532,Flexible Job-Shop Scheduling Problem With Sequencing  Flexibility For Just-In-Time Production Systems,"scheduling in a flexible job-shop environment is a crucial task that allows the smooth flow of materials. traditionally, this problem considers a predetermined sequence of operations and due dates to deliver the jobs. in this paper, a new formulation of the flexible job-shop scheduling problem is presented. in the proposed model, flexible sequences for the jobs are allowed to enable more alternatives for scheduling. additionally, just-in-time approach is considered in order to complete each job. hence, the problem allocates operations to machines and sequence them according to precedence relationships. moreover, jobs' deliveries need to be on time to satisfy customer's requirements and reduce storage costs. therefore, a mixed-integer linear programming model is formulated to minimize the sum of weighted earliness and weighted tardiness simultaneously. the model is implemented in a numerical experiment to show its applicability. the proposed model is intended to be used in production systems that are just-in-time oriented.",just-in-time,"Fierce competition in the market has encouraged organizations to look for ways to minimize waste. In order to align with this trend, JIT scheduling helps to minimize the costs related to early and tardy deliveries. Additionally, flexible job shops allow the production of a job that may have different processing sequences. Hence, in this paper, a MILP formulation has been introduced to address the FJSP with sequence flexibility and just-in-time deliveries. The developed model minimizes the sum of weighted earliness and tardiness of the deliveries. The model was tested in a small example, finding the optimal solution and demonstrating that the consideration of sequencing flexibility and JIT environment represent a real-world problem. The model can be used to solve small to medium instances, and it can serve for representation purposes. The model's significance relies on the inclusion of more realistic settings that many industries have and have been studied independently. Future research avenues consider creating larger instances, implementing real scenarios, and developing a solution method for larger cases such as metaheuristics.

533,Modeling The Influence Of Hazardous Road Sections:  Features Of Road Traffic Accident Occurrence In Tunisia,"road safety is a broad topic that includes many aspects, such as road conditions, vehicles, the environment, and driving characteristics. understanding how every factor contributes to the frequency of accidents is therefore not a simple task. modeling the frequencies of traffic injuries in dangerous road segments may therefore give detailed insights into the safety consequences of explanatory factors for the frequency of accidents. thus, based on the variable of interest, many modelling approaches have been applied. the focus of this research is to explore the relationship between dangerous crashes on certain road sections and a variety of geometric, road, traffic flow, and spatial characteristics in the region of monastir in tunisia. accident statistics for 70 accident-prone road sections were obtained for this purpose between 2013 and 2018. a negative binomial model was used in the analysis, and the empirical results are of great interest. the presence of national highways, high speed limits, and the existence of drainage systems and crash barriers can increase the number of crashes on unsafe road sections. nevertheless, the presence of a correct alignment, roads with two-way lanes, the presence of vertical and horizontal signs, and roads without parking help reduce the frequency of accidents. this study therefore provides some useful insights into tunisia’s dangerous road segments, and these may help tunisia’s public authorities to develop effective interventions.","tunisia, road safety, accident frequency",,"attig ines department of economics faculty of economic sciences and management of sousse university of sousse, tunisia attigines2@gmail.com ouni fedy department of transportation and logistics higher institute of transport and logistics of sousse. university of sousse, tunisia fedy.ouni@gmail.com harizi riadh department of business administration. university of bisha, bisha, saudi arabia college of business, po. box 1113, bisha, 61922, saudi arabia rharizi@ub.edu.sa",
534,A Conceptual Framework For Adopting Ambidexterity In  Circular Supply Chains,"the incorporation of the circular economy principles into supply chain management leads to a circular supply chain (csc), which fosters the perpetual flow of materials in a cyclical manner without damaging the environment, society or economy. this perpetual flow is essential for organizations to survive in an ever-increasingly dynamic environment and in a natural resource-constrained economy (nrce). therefore, organizations, which aim to implement csc must seek to identify an intermediating factor, which should simultaneously foster reactive supply chain strategies to manage natural resources limitation and proactive supply chain strategies for uncertain environment. the concept of ambidexterity enabling the simultaneous pursuit of exploration and exploitation aligns with the principles of csc. however, this concept has not been investigated in the csc literature to date. within this context, the aim of this paper is to propose a conceptual framework to adopt ambidexterity in csc. the framework has a two-dimensional hierarchy that includes eco-efficiency aimed at reactive strategies, and eco-effectiveness aimed at proactive strategies: both regenerative and restorative from supply chain process perspective, closed-loop and open-loop/cascading from flow perspective. this paper provides a conceptual framework with four propositions that should enable the adoption of ambidexterity in csc.","circular economy, supply chain, ambidexterity, exploration",,"tanja nathan, benny tjahjono, jason begley and jordon lazell centre for business in society coventry university, coventry cv1 5fb, uk nathanrt@uni.coventry.ac.uk, benny.tjahjono@coventry.ac.uk, jason.begley@coventry.ac.uk, jordon.lazell@coventry.ac.uk",
535,Land Development Processes And Property Rights: Topdown And Bottom-Up Approaches In Windhoek Namibia,"land and housing ownership are a popular bone of contention in cities. it has unearthed many injustices and sparked numerous protests pertaining to rights and access to the city. as the two have embodied different meanings in different societies over the centuries. the apartheid regime and its strict control over property and ownership created severe inequalities and injustices for the post-apartheid city. at present, cities in the global south are challenged by the coloniality of these injustices. where the heterogeneity of said challenges alone hinder the citizenship, socio-economic and spatial inclusion of the urban poor in the city. this study investigates dual land development processes and their associated property rights in windhoek to understand their implications and propose an alternative to the spatial planning and development praxis in the city. as a mixed methods approach, the study gleans insights on land and housing development processes, delivery, and the characteristics of tenure security and rights in windhoek. together the findings illustrate the features influencing the land and housing ownership and development nexus in windhoek over the past three decades. the mixed methods approach was ideal for this study as it facilitated a detailed investigation of a complex phenomenon.","property rights, land development, ownership",,"romancia shoonga, trynos gumbo and eric makoni department of urban & regional planning university of johannesburg 25 louisa street, johannesburg, 2028 rncshoonga@gmail.com, tgumbo@uj.ac.za, emakoni@uj.ac.za","references are 
governed by financial means or not. Another study can run a spatial analysis of the city's growth from 1990 to 2021. 
This would add a geographically scientific element to the spatial transformation of the post-apartheid city. Another 
study can look at determining which part of the city developed the fastest by dividing the city into four geographical 
blocks (i.e., north, south, east, and west) and conducting a spatial longitudinal study, spanning from 1970 to 2030.  
9. Recommendations 
This part of the study is a call to action, where the researcher proposes suggestions that would improve future research, 
policy, and practice. Given the contemporary nature of the housing challenge, it is perhaps the obvious course to take. 
The suggestions to follow are not exhaustive but are suggestions to aid the holistic approach to understand the nexus 
between land and housing ownership and its development in the Windhoek context. The first and most important 
course of action to be taken is arranging a housing environment indaba. It should be led by the state and must include 
all the housing environment stakeholders. Secondly, the top-down approach needs to incorporate the socio-economic 
survey in order for urban planners to initiate the mixed-income living environment. This will set the tone and standard 
for the other stakeholders in terms of innovations and public-private partnerships. There needs to be a clear 
understanding of the interlinkages within the industry, the greater economy, the environment, and the stakeholders. 
The state and housing stakeholders need to invest in conducting research to better understand the landscape according 
to the consumer's preferences. The above points illustrate a simplified framework that would inform the trajectory of 
affordable housing within the Windhoek context. The engagements cannot be once-off but may decrease in frequency 
once the interpretations and regulations are clarified for all the stakeholders. Each step influences the prior and 
subsequent steps as they are all interrelated in one way or another.

536,Governance Mechanisms For Managing Municipal Solid  Waste: A Review,"the rural-urban drift has led to increased population and generation of municipal solid waste. local governments are unable to cope based on current governance mechanisms resulting into unsustainable management of municipal solid waste. this results into unsustainable management of municipal solid waste thereby threatening both public health and the environment. the solid waste management challenge has been approached with a technical solution overlooking governance mechanisms as can be evident by the persistent municipal solid waste challenges. governance mechanisms are meant to exercise control of the sector and if enhanced would result into sustainable municipal solid waste management. a literature review was conducted to identify governance mechanisms for managing municipal solid waste in developed and developing countries. the study has shown that developed countries have implemented robust policy and laws and have strong institutions that provide oversight roles for managing municipal solid waste. zambia has governance mechanisms for managing municipal solid waste. however, the country still faces challenges in managing municipal solid waste and therefore calls for enhanced governance. the results of the study would be useful to policy makers, waste managers, the private sector and international partners in order to achieve sustainable municipal solid waste management.","governance, mechanisms, municipal, solid",,"kachikoti w banda1, bupe g mwanza2, erastus m mwananumo3, ian nzali banda4 1, 2, 3, 4 university of zambia department of civil and environmental engineering school of engineering university of zambia lusaka, zambia billkachikoti@gmail.com1, bupe.mwanza@gmail.com2, erastus.m.mwanaumo@gmail.com3 iannzalibanda@gmail.com 4","References

538,Room For Improvement? – Current Issues In Highly  Automated Manufacturing,"background – companies have to constantly improve and adapt to the dynamically changing conditions, in order to remain competitive. this implies a fundamental change in the organization and the mindset of employees, as well as a continuous improvement of internal processes, in both direct and indirect areas. especially in a highly automated production, thins leads to a new level of complexity, that adds to the difficulty to further improve existing processes. purpose –. this paper gives insights into the discussion of the future role of process improvement in highly automated production and the relevance of new digital technologies to further enhance productivity. methodology/approach – in order to address the research question, virtual focus groups have been chosen as a qualitative approach. seven executives of german large-scale enterprises assessed the future role of process improvements in a highly automated manufacturing setting. findings – results show that the potential for process improvements in manufacturing is still high. while the integration of continuous process improvement aims for incremental improvements, new technologies open up opportunities to address existing inefficiencies, unscheduled downtimes and excessive rework by addressing hitherto unsolved problems.",,"Although large-scale enterprise already invested a lot of effort into the automation and optimization of their manufacturing processes there is still room for significant improvements. On the one hand continuous process improvement continuous process improvement aims for steady but incremental improvements. On the other hand new technologies, such as big data analytics or worker assistant systems open up opportunities to tackle existing inefficiencies, unscheduled downtimes and excessive rework by addressing hitherto unsolved problems. An highly automated manufacturing results in such a complexity that additional digital tools are needed to gather and analyze a rash of data. Here people come to the fore as a further potential source of error. Any process optimization also represents a creative challenge, where one-sided perspectives must be prevented in order to identify best measures. Necessarily, a global perspective must be taken taking digitalized solutions into account. However, it is not sufficient to digitally transform your manufacturing, your entire organization needs to be digital. This is the prerequisite to identify all bottlenecks to be optimized. Consequently, both digitalization and continuous improvement must rely on fundamental organizational change as well as on the adoption of a suitable mindset. Every employee has to support the transformation and must be incorporated into decentralized improvement processes, which are expected to be the most promising approach to significantly increase the efficiency and effectivity in large-scale enterprises. Efforts to date have essentially focused on optimizing the technical aspects of the production methodology. However, due to this limited perspective, the existing efficiency potential can only be exploited to a limited extent. Therefore, further research should concentrate on the integration of the human capital for process improvement and find ways to to implement an suitable mindset to integrate management and behavioral aspects into decentralized optimization efforts.","christoph szedlak, kristin wagner, jasmin ohlig bert leyendecker university of applied sciences koblenz, faculty of operations management konrad-zuse-str. 1, 56075 koblenz, germany {szedlak, krwagner, leyendecker}@hs-koblenz.de",

The incorporation of apps or software in supply chain management leads to the smart handling system. Besides that, it can reduce the reliance on manpower in every process of the organization. Hence, the future of handling warehouse is governed by robotic and cloud software instead of human handling and hard copy such as tagging. Moreover, the sustainability of software and cloud server are assessed with the amount of logistic information that will be programmed in the system. Indirectly, the incorporation of technologies in supply chain management transforms the process into industry 4.0 with a drastic overhaul in the working procedure. Capacity and capability development to up-skill the knowledge of operators and consumers will be enhanced. The growth of business will penetrate the local market and reached the emerging markets in a global level to be on par with the developed countries. As a concluding fact, the revolution in logistic management creates a whole new ecosystem and serve as an example for other business operations.

550,The Influence Of Promotion In Social Media And Word Of  Mouth On The Decision On Selection Of Study Programs,"university competition, especially private universities during the covid-19 pandemic, was very tight. the impact of the covid-19 pandemic is not only on health but has an impact on the economy and also on education. some parents of students experience economic difficulties, so that several universities have experienced a decline in students and prospective students. the selection of study programs is a new problem for prospective students because many universities are closed and only open student admissions online in the current pandemic era. higher education is required to be able to implement effective marketing strategies through promotion. this study aimed to see the impact of social media and word of mouth on selecting study programs at private universities. this research design uses a quantitative research approach with a survey method. the survey was conducted on 215 students from several private universities in palembang city, indonesia. the data analysis technique was performed by multiple regression analysis. the results showed a positive and significant influence from social media and word of mouth on the decision to choose a study program at a private university in palembang city. the digital era has demanded universities to carry out all their activities online so that social media is an effective means of promoting higher education. student satisfaction felt during lectures will convey information by word of mouth and recommend their choice of the study program to others. private universities that rely on student funding are expected to build communication through social media and word of mouth.","electoral decision, private college, promotion, social media","Based on the above discussion, it is concluded that promotion through social media is a fairly effective marketing strategy, and supported by positive Word of mouth will be able to attract prospective students to decide on their selection of a study program for private tertiary institutions in Palembang city. This study did not fully cover all private universities in Palembang, due to limitations due to the covid-19 outbreak. So it is hoped that further researchers can research all universities in the city of Palembang. This research also does not meet all the characteristics of private universities, so that further research can better meet all the characteristics of private and public universities.","at private universities ramadhoni adam students on a management study program universitas bina darma palembang, indonesia ramadhoniadam18@gmail.com muji gunarto*) faculty of economics and business universitas bina darma palembang, indonesia *)corresponding author: mgunarto@binadarma.ac.id",

552,Investigating Soot Blowing Mechanism Of Boilers  Kholofelo Errol Malatji; D.V.V Kallon,"soot blowers are often neglected aspects of the boiler operation in a coal power plant whereas they have a significant impact on the financial bottom line as they improve the efficiency of the boiler. soot deposits are hard to manage if they are left unattended as they form a thick insulating layer, which reduced the efficiency of the boiler. it increases the loss of energy due to high temperature of the exhaust gasses, as well as emissions. sasol has a power station at secunda, south africa. sasol uses soot blowers as means of cleaning the boiler during operation which are operated manually. the purpose of this paper is to investigate the soot blowers of the boilers and determine their strengths and limitations as well as the areas that need improving. the paper focuses mostly on the steam soot blowers and comparing it to the acoustic soot blowers. a literature review was done to highlight the key features of the different types of soot blowers. tests on the existing concept was done leading to a new model to be introduced to improve efficiency. the final concept was created and modelled via simulations.","soot blower, boiler, heat transfer, efficiency","The project was conducted to investigate the soot blowing mechanism of boilers. From research, it was found that the types of soot blowers available were steam, water cannon, air and acoustic soot blowers. Their properties, advantages and limitations were compared to select the most effective one. Steam soot blowers were found to be the most effective on high temperature as and sticky ash and therefore they were selected as the best choice. Acoustic soot blowers were also recommended for lower temperature zones over the steam soot blowers as they have a simple design and they are cost effective as they require less maintenance. Long retractable soot blowers were found to be vulnerable as they have a long lance which experiences higher stress when operating. The introduction of IoT was also covered to show it can optimize efficiency and improve the maintenance of the equipment. 6.

553,Towards The Development Of An Energy Audit Program  For Residents In Freetown,"the increasing electricity demand in freetown, capital of sierra leone. has been a burden on the country’s electricity sector, since the electricity demanded by residents in freetown outweighs the electricity generated by the nation’s electricity generation and transmission company (egtc). this problem has resulted to power shortage leaving many areas within the capital city for hours or days without electricity supply. a major challenge faced by the country’s electricity generating sector is the losses on the distribution and transmission networks, which accounts for 34.5% losses in the capital of freetown alone according to 2017 government electricity report. a 161 kilovolts (kv) of the national transmission network runs from a 250km bumbuna hydroelectric power plant to the freetown substations. another source of electricity loss in freetown, according to the electricity distribution and supply authority (edsa), is non-technical losses resulting from human theft and illegal connections from the national grid by its residents. this paper assesses the development of an efficient energy audit program to minimise electricity loses within freetown. this study involves the use of a quantitative data collection approach using randomly distributed questionnaires to residents within freetown. from the data collected and analysed, shows that the development of an effective and efficient energy audit program within freetown can minimize energy wastage in buildings as well as electricity losses.","electricity demand, power shortage, electricity losses","The main objective of the paper was to investigate the significance of energy audit, the types and procedure of an energy audit were also discussed with a review on some relevance on the energy audit process. The quantitative data collection method using structured questionnaires and the analysis of various sections on the questionnaires was discussed.

554,Analysis Of Safety Performance Of Signalized Intersections In  Abu Dhabi,"this research study's objective was to define the standards that road safety auditors rely on when auditing signalized intersection. further, the research study aimed to determine the safety indicators used by specialists in evaluating existing hubs and prioritizing countermeasures. additionally, the study explored gaps in the decision-making process, which often ignored safety concerns. the research study was divided into two phases. notably, phase one was based on qualitative analysis in which statistical analysis of traffic crashes at the signalized section was conducted. the poisson regression model was utilized in this case. the second phase of the research was based on the qualitative analysis in which interviews were conducted based on the statistical analysis results obtained in phase one. here, interviews were conducted by the corresponding author on ten certified road safety auditors in abu dhabi. in the interviews, the study subjects were queried on several aspects such as the general information regarding their careers as auditors and the decision-making process typically effected at a signalized intersection in abu dhabi. the study participants also explored the significance of some of the variables identified in phase one of the research. the objective here was to validate the outcomes obtained in phase one of the research work and highlight the experience required to enhance road safety by auditors. the variables identified in phase one of the qualitative analysis are highlighted in table 1, table 2, and table 3 in the qualitative research","sayed, & reyad","All in all, the thematic research methodology can be used to analyze fairly complex data in a rather robust and effective fashion. In this work, the interviews were analyzed using the thematic analysis approach. Several inferences were drawn from the finding: i. Abu Dhabi Road Safety Manual lacks the prerequisite parameters extracted from the traffic crash studies which it makes a good road safety manual. As a result, the Abu Dhabi Road Safety Manual needs periodic improvements based on traffic crashes in the city. ii. Skipping early stages of RSA causes poor implementation of the Abu Dhabi Road Safety Manual while auditing traffic safety issues by assigned auditors. iii. Poor signal plans is major cause of crashes at the signalized intersections in Abu Dhabi according to those interviewed and providing physical separation for left turning vehicles in case of using lead lag operation traffic signal should be considered. iv. The safety indicators include: Identifying who can be hurt and how they can get hurt in case of a traffic crash at the intersections; geometric design of the intersections; visibility of the intersections and road; and the effectiveness of the signal phasing used in the intersection. v. It was found that some RSA comments are not being considered seriously. Thus, there are gaps in the decision-making process and ignorance of the safety concerns from the auditing process.

555,Usability Tool Evaluation Using Usability Testing Method At  Pt Media Dokter Investama (Halodoc Indonesia),"halodoc indonesia catalog division staff uses a “tool” in carrying out the work process. this “tool” is undoubtedly a very primary and essential tool for the catalog division staff. this high level of need against the “tool” creates a great enthusiasm to observe deeper into everything from this “tool” like how the tool works, how the staff uses the tool, and how the level of usability tool is. about how the tool works and how the staff uses the tool are known by participating in the staff's work. the usability level of the tool is known by using the usability testing method, where the method can calculate the usability level of four components, such as 1) learnability, 2) efficiency, 3) errors, and 4) satisfaction. based on the type of work, in general, catalog division performs 3 types of work, such as 1) create doctor data and service products, 2) create hospital data, and 3) create and drop schedules also manage doctors and service slots. the learnability component is represented based on the success rate in the amount of 76%. the efficiency component is represented based on the time-based efficiency, in the amount of 0.002 goals/sec. the errors component is represented based on the error rate, in the amount of 0.6. based on the results, it turns out that further review is needed and at this stage, found the addition of 20 issues from the tool and proposed 20 improvement recommendations to the tool on these issues. the proposed improvement recommendations are then measured further by calculating the comparison of satisfaction level between before and after the improvement recommendations are conceived. the satisfaction level measurement is carried out to know concretely whether these recommendations have a major effect on the satisfaction level or not. the results will affect future work quality.","usability, usability testing, halodoc, usability tool","and Suggestions 6.1 Conclusion Based on data analysis and processing, then k esimpulan who successfully obtained are : 1. The level of usability to the tool reviewed based components Learnability, Efficiency, Errors, and Satisfaction. For the Learnability component, the average success rate of the staff is compared with the average success rate according to Sauro, which is 78%, then the staff's average success rate is in the bad category (2% below Sauro's average success rate). For the Efficiency component, The average ideal ratio according to Sauro is 3.20 or 3 times longer than the expert. Therefore, it can be concluded that the working time for the staff was categorized as normal. For the Errors component, the error rate is compared with the ideal error rate according to Sauro, 0.7; So the error rate generated by the staff is in the fair category, but it still needs attention because this figure is almost touching the ideal error rate according to Sauro. For the Satisfaction component, the System Usability Scale (SUS) questionnaire is reviewed within the SUS assessment scale, then the average has Adjective category Ratings ""Poor"", Grade Scale obtained is the value ""F"", and Acceptability Ranges in the category ""Not Acceptable"". This condition is very concerning, so the tool really needs to be reviewed more deeply regarding common problems, this can be done by further interviewing the division team. 2. After further interviewing, there are found 20 issues and the 20 recommendation improvements are given to the tool to optimize the level of usability are redesigning the system from the website tool to add a deletion system/slot removal at the current time; Set back section ""scheduling"" to be able to add and remove add leave at the current time; Set on the application system to not be able to book when the booking occurs on the same day (book button inactive); The added feature is to directly input the clock you want to create; Added the feature ""repeat schedule for next year""; Add section ""Operational License Number""; Rearrange system tools so that they return to ""Personnel List"" instead of ""General Info"", and so on. 3. The 20 improvement recommendations have been proven to be successful as seen from the calculation of the percentage increase in the satisfaction level. It can be seen that the smallest percentage increase value is 44.4% and the largest percentage increase value is 73.4%. 6.2 Suggestions Based on the basis of the conclusions above, the suggestions can be in put forward are: 1. A review of the problem with the tool reflecting the experience of the Catalog Division Staff can be done further carefully. 2. Recommendations for tool improvements can still be discussed carefully both with the Head of the Catalog Division and with the Product Division before making visualizations or prototypes so that the resulting recommendations for improvements are recommendations for fixes that solve the root cause.","selvi and rienna oktarina industrial engineering department bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia, 11480 selvi001@binus.ac.id, rienna.oktarina@binus.ac.id",

Berau Coal Block Parapatan,"the coal mining industry is a high-cost and high-risk business and is significantly exposed to high turbulence of uncertainties. valuation and assessment of a business project that is described as having high complexity and uncertainty requiring a comprehensive analysis. parapatan block of binungan site, part of ccow of pt. berau coal is an active mining area in the last year, which previously stopped operating for six years. the valuation method used by pt berau coal to value a mining project is discounted cash flow (dcf). both the dcf and ro methods are used to evaluate the economical feasibility of the planned project of parapatan block of berau coal. the studied mining project is financially feasible by providing the positive value of npv for all three technical scenario options, reviewed with the dcf valuation methods, the base 4-year production period (base option), 18 years production period with lct moda (option-1), and 18 years production period with bridge moda (option-2). provide the npv as us$ 10.62 million for base option, us$ 10.10 million for option-1, and us$ 8.30 million for option-2. further studies to optimize coal reserves mining using the real options method resulted in an option-1 scenario as an option that could be proposed to management. option-1 provides the best average npv value supported by the expand option scenario, a technical scenario in the form of accelerating investment and increasing production of the parapatan pit mine. option- 1 generates us $ 21.48 million npv with 38% irr. furthermore, this option offers the opportunity for a statistically highest maximum npv of us$ 248 million.","valuation, uncertainty, dcf, real option","To sum up, the need for Berau Coal to implement the expanding scenario of the Parapatan mine project is expected to provide optimal values in maintaining production capacity and maintaining the stability of operational mining costs, a synergizing of various analyses has been conducted in this research to answer the research question regarding the project feasibility and the certainty of the project's return. Where it is financially feasible by providing the positive value of NPV for all three technical scenario options, reviewed on DCF valuation methods. The Discounted Cash Flow analysis shows the NPV is at US$ 10.62 million for base option, US$ 10.10 million for option-1, and US$ 8.30 million for option-2. Other than that, The real options analysis approach presents additional investment technical options related to increased production. It reveals that option-1 obtained the best average NPV value supported by the Expand Option scenario with a value of US$21.48 million and an IRR of 38%. In the high uncertainty scheme, the range of the NPV value becomes wider from US$ -88.8 million to US$ 71.3 million statically. And for the worst one, it can generate negative project value for the company. PT. Berau Coal should pay attention deeper to this issue to mitigate and prevent the risk happens and especially to the key factors that may influence the risk. Due to the project is very dynamic financially and operationally, The market fluctuation, global price index, mine stripping ratio earned, fuel price fluctuation, changes of mining service rate, and hauling distance factor are the most crucial points to be well-handled by Berau Coal. These changes should be addressed with appropriate adjustments to the projected project’s financial return. This study recommends a continuous and regular process of analysis and review on the assessment of the project’s performance.

572,Optimal Promotional Effort And Pricing Policies For A  Multiple Item Innovation Diffusion Model Involving Fuzzy,"with immense competition, coupled with short and unpredictable shelf life of products in some cases, companies rely upon diversifying their product range to disperse risk associated with failure of one product. since pricing is also dynamic, varying with time, there is also a need for the companies to formulate appropriate pricing policies to maximize profits as against expenses incurred in promotion of multiple products. in this paper we device and analyze policies for promoting sales of multiple products in the market through optimal control theory problems. the main aim is to maximize profits while considering multiple product range, demand requirements and optimum pricing policy for an available budget for promotion. to be as near as possible to a real-life situation, the total available budget is taken to be imprecise. further, optimal control model with fuzzy parameter is converted into crisp form by using both necessity and possibility constraints. the solution is derived using pontryagin maximum principle and the entire technique is illustrated by giving a numerical example.","fuzzy parameter, multiple item","Here we see that the total expenditure on promotion in the first scenario is 596216.5531 units whereas in the second scenario it is 609286.2793 units. Thus, we observe that a higher level of expenditure on promotion results in increase in the profit for a fuzzy (variable) budget. The triangular fuzzy number representing the total budget is given by (528000, 600000, 660000), thereby showing that the expense in the first scenario lies in the lower interval (528000, 600000) , whereas the expense in the second scenario lies in the upper interval (600000, 660000). We also note that the increase in promotional effort rates results in the increase in sales.

574,Investigation Of Cracks And Damages At The Bends Of  Soot Blower Tubes,"at the sasol power generating station in secunda, south africa, the ash producing fuels used to fire the boilers cause build-up of combustion by-products on the surfaces of the boiler, including soot, ash and slag on the walls of the economisers, re-heaters and super-heaters. the need to clean up those by-products is identified and the equipment used to reduce this effect at sasol is the soot blower. during the operation of the equipment, it is realized that the tubes of the soot blowers develop cracks that hinders their function. this paper investigates the causes of cracks and damages at the bends of soot blower tubes. a computational fluid dynamics model of the lance tube is presented in this the paper. the section of the tube where the steam and flue gases pass were modelled to obtain detailed distributions. the results of temperature and pressure distributions on the lance tube body is presented. actual temperature and pressure ranges of the boiler were kept at 800-1000 degrees celsius and 800-1000 kpa respectively. the results revealed high temperature at the tip of the lance tube near the nozzle. the intrusion of flue gases results in harmful chemical reactions that cause corrosion to the tubes.","soot blower, heat transfer, flue gases","From the findings, it can be concluded that the cracks are caused not only by one factor but also by a number of factors. One of the factors that contribute to the cracks on the lance tubes, as investigated, is the exposure to high temperatures. This leads to different kinds of stresses i.e. thermal stresses and hoop stresses. The pits that form as a result of a chemical reaction between the stainless steel and the water vapour are causing corrosion on the tubes. The intrusion of flue gases via the air-purge system causes damage to the lance tubes when the water vapour reacts with the material of the tubes.

575,Intangible Risk Assessment Methodology For Projects  (Iramp): Assessing Behavior-Centric Intangible Risks In,"industrial projects are complex sociotechnical systems (e.g., human agents interacting with technology) where the cause-and-effect implications of human actions do not necessarily occur in time-and-space proximity. the proposed methodology, intangible risk assessment methodology for projects (iramp), utilizes a behavior-centric risk breakdown structure, risk causal factors, and a risk inducement matrix linking risks to their causal factors. a metanetwork (i.e., a network of networks) matrix is presented consisting of the interactions among intangible risks, causal factors, human agents, and project tasks. we build upon rasmussen’s dynamic safety model and address the need for a framework to assess causal factors that influence behaviors in the context of energy-sector project management. looking forward, the evolution of technology (e.g., artificial intelligence, automation, robotics, etc.) will increase the need for enhanced social and emotional skills in the workforce to effectively deliver project objectives. consequently, the ability to proactively identify and address the associated “softer” risks could become a source of competitive advantage.","intangible risk, metanetwork matrix",,"capital projects christopher cox kimmel school of construction management western carolina university cullowhee, nc, usa coxhome@ownmail.net hamid parsaei wm michael barnes ’64 department of industrial and systems engineering texas a&m university college station, tx 77840 hamid.parsaei@tamu.edu","References

576,Impact Of Critical Influential Factors Of Knowledge  Management And Innovation On Uae Organization,"although the role in information, growth and communication education is not well known, knowledge management in universities (km). university programme theory, research and other priorities in advanced education remain relatively confined both inside and beyond the organisational sense. knowledge must be created, manufactured and distributed. for supervisors, pupils and professors, this has immense consequences. km's study of higher education institutions allows researchers and specialists to consider the main factors in (and probably external) academia for proper knowledge management results. the goal of this study is to recognize the effect on uae university success of crucial impact factors for information management and management. the findings could illustrate that a difficult relationship between variables and actions relevant to the information climate results in a proper application of km activities and initiatives in the uae. this study will increase the factors of creativity in knowledge management against the success of uae public universities.",innovation,"In the higher education institutions, knowledge management (KM) is not well understood despite its position in knowledge creation, development and communication (HEIs). The philosophy and study of the curriculum of universities and others in advanced education in and without the operational context is comparatively limited. It defines, produces and communicates knowledge. Information. This has crucial implications for their managers, students and instructors. The KM thesis on HEIs helps researchers and specialists to consider key factors of sound KM performance in (and potentially beyond) academia. The objective of this research is to identify the impact on UAE University Performance of critical influential knowledge and innovative management factors. The results are expected to demonstrate that a complex interplay of the factors and behaviours related to the knowledge environment results in the proper implementation of KM practices and initiatives in the UAE.

589,A Pressure Vessel Model Developed Via Submerged Arc  Welding,"in this paper a pressure vessel model is developed via submerged arc welding (saw) method. storage vessels that are design for pressures of about 50kpa are regulated. the transportable gas container are not pressure vessels in themselves, however, the process heating equipment of steam or hot water generation are defined as pressure vessels. the manufacturing of these vessels follow certain health and safety regulations such as iso9001:2015. accordingly, a pressure vessel is designed to be fabricated using these safety standards. in this research the welding current, voltages, and travel speed significantly affects the tensile strength and the hardness. the first factor welding current of about 260, 270 and 280 amperes were used for the investigation. the results show high density and increased material tensile strength and hardness. the welding using saw was done safely and each condition was tested a total of three times by using full factories design. all the components parts aligned properly, there was no misalignment that could be observed.","pressure vessels, material selection","and Discussion This paper developed a pressure vessel via submerging arc welding. For the welding samples the tensile strength and hardness were found to correspond to a formation of pearlite density in the welding metal and heat affected zone (Sharpies and Clayton, et al, p322). On joining these four cylinder components using submerged arc welding (SAW) machine, the process of welding started by submerging the four sides with the small welding seams to give the components the strength then the whole body was considered. The welding seams are big as possible to avoid leaking of the liquids or gases when they are poured inside the train pressure vessel. The DOT 111 train pressure vessel has been replaced by the DOT 117 train pressure vessel which is an improvement on containing and transportation of the liquids or gases (Sharpies and Clayton, et al, p322). It is recommended that hydraulic test be done to see if there is a problem with the train pressure vessel more especially gapes or holes during the welding process. For developing models via submerged arc welding (SAW) machine could improve train manufacturing process, A very well designed 3D solid model of the train pressure vessel fabricated via submerged arc welding will address the problems of welding misalignment. After the submerging process the train pressure vessel would be put in the oven to boost the welding seams. The tensile strength and hardness would improve to give the welding seams strength on the pressure vessel. The welding currents should be started from 260, 270 and 280 amperes (Sharpies Proceedings of the 11th Annual International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management Singapore, March 7-11, 2021","n.v. chauke department of mechaincal and industrial engineering technology university of johannesburg johannesburg, south africa vincentchauke09@gmail.com d.v.v. kallon department of mechaincal and industrial engineering technology university of johannesburg johannesburg, south africa dkallon@uj.ac.za","References

All the sampled locations within the study area were affected by the oil spillage in the study area, which has caused increased radionuclides and heavy metals in the area which exceeded the WHO recommended limit. There were fluctuations in the level of heavy metals analyzed from positions as shown in the diversity of radionuclide substance in water and soil specimen and was chiefly of biological basis. The increased presence of metals like 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃2+ in the specimen containing water shows that the water is polluted and unsafe for domestic or agricultural use. This, therefore, requires strategic policies such as proper clean-up and other Impact mitigation measures (IMM) in the event of oil spillage, regular monitoring of the radiation level, and enforcing environmental legislation to reduce drastic effects to the public.","ngene tochukwu & oyekola peter department of applied physics & mechanical engineering papua new guinea university of technology tochukwu07@gmail.com, petertosin@gmail.com ikpeteboa abigail ministry of water resources bayelsa state abieniye099@gmail.com",

597,Smart Transaction Picking In Tier-To-Tier Sbs/Rs By Deep  Q-Learning,"by the rapid growth of e-commerce, the intralogistics sector is facing new challenges. intralogistics sector requires more flexible, scalable processes with maximum reliability and availability. they are complicated and interconnected systems, whose all components are required to be perfectly coordinated with each other for optimal functionality. in this work, we study an intralogistics technology, shuttle-based storage and retrieval system (sbs/rs), where shuttles are tier-to-tier. in this novel system design, in an effort to increase shuttle utilization as well as decrease initial investment cost, shuttles are designed in a more flexible travel manner so that they can change their tiers within an aisle by using a separate lifting mechanism. due to the complexity of such system design as well as aiming to obtain fast transaction process time by the decreased number of shuttles in the system, we implement a deep q-learning (dql) approach to let shuttles select the best transaction to process based on its targets. we compare the performance of the dql by the average cycle time per transaction performance metric with the other well-known selection rules, first-in-first-out (fifo) and shortest process time (spt). results show that deep q-learning approach produces better results than those fifo and spt.","sbs/rs, deep q-learning, simulation","This paper studies a Deep Q-Learning approach for transaction selection in a tier-to-tier shuttle-based storage and retrieval system. Our aim is to implement a smart selection algorithm for shuttles so that average cycle time of a transaction is decreased. We treat the shuttles as intelligent agents so that they can be trained from their past experiences and make smart decisions in transaction selection. The state information is received from the environment in real time and estimated flow time is calculated by using the DQL algorithm. Based on the results, the best alternative is selected to be processed. The main motivation of this work is to implement an algorithm that is adaptive to changing conditions and able to learn from its experience. The algorithm iterates over time to learn the best possible assignment of transaction to shuttle. The system is simulated in a Python library, SimPy and Deep Q-Network is utilized by using the Keras library. We compare the DQL algorithm’s results with two traditional selection rules, FIFO and SPT. The results show that, for the average cycle time performance metric, 40% improvement is obtained by DQL, compared to FIFO rule, under inter-arrival time of 7.6 sec. Under inter-arrival time of 7.2 sec., this improvement is 68%. When the results are compared with the SPT rule, it is 14% and 17% improvement under inter-arrival time of 7.6 sec. and 7.2 sec., respectively. The results indicate that as the arrival rates increases, namely under higher utilizations of shuttles, the DQL algorithm works better. As a future work, queue related information of transactions could be included in state definition. Hence, reward function may become more precise contributing better selection policy. Those algorithms can be experimented under different warehousing designs such as number of tiers, racks, shuttles, etc.","bartu arslan, banu y. ekren department of industrial engineering yasar university no:37-39, bornova, izmir, turkey bartuarslan@yahoo.com, banu.ekren@yasar.edu.tr",
598,Fault Tree Analysis Of A Reverse Osmosis Plant,": – water resources in kuwait are very scarce and do not meet the ever growing demand. to satisfy this colossal water demand and to compensate for the shortage of freshwater, the government has constructed desalination plants. water desalination processes separate dissolved salts and other minerals from water from brackish, and seawater to produce water suitable for human consumption or irrigations. reverse osmosis (ro) is a proven technology for desalinating seawater; it is pressure driven membrane processes. the analysis in this work enfolds an assessment of the performance of a small reverse osmosis plant with and without an energy recovery pelton wheel turbine. the data collected are from an experimental ro plant in the region; these data are concerned with the failures of several components and subsystems of the plant over a 4-year period of continuous operation. using fault tree technique, the long term of the system is obtained by calculating the unavailability of the different subsystems. since the plant is designed for continuous operation; the operational time was used to assess the performance of the plant key words; energy recovery system, availability, failure probabilities, operational time 1 introduction energy and water and are the essential elements for the development of modern societies; water is essential for the existence of life on the plant, and fresh water constitutes only 3% of the water available on earth. therefore, man countries suffer fresh water scarcity. many countries in the middle east, especially the arabian gulf countries such as kuwait have limited fresh water resources. the gcc countries have resorted to water desalination to satisfy their water demand. kuwait is an arid country, rich in oil resources, but poor in natural water resources it is bordering the arabian gulf. kuwait is a rich, oil- producing country with a gross domestic product (gdp) of around $123 billion. the country does not have significant natural resources of freshwater. the average annual rainfall is only about 110 mm. the rate of freshwater consumption in kuwait is one of the highest in the world (currently, over 600 liters per capita per day) and it is escalating at a staggering rate of about 7.9% annually. such per capita levels of water consumption are considered excessively high, especially where there are limited agricultural and industrial activities [1] therefore, kuwait relies widely on seawater desalination to meet the ever increasing demand; desalination is a process of separating dissolved minerals from saline water. multi-stage- flash (msf) is the desalination process largely used in kuwait for the last 40 years. it is an established technology and is combined with co-generation of electricity. however, one of the main shortcomings of msf is its highly energy consumption. however, reverse osmosis (ro) technologies have also been gradually adopted with some very large plants now in operation in the region. the ro market has considerably increased during the recent years. the major factors affecting the cost of product water of ro plants are the power consumption and capital cost. a pictorial presentation of ro plant is exhibited in figures 1. the plant comprises a seawater feed source; a pretreatment module; a high pressure feed pump; an ro membranes rack; and a post treatment module. ro membranes are two types: spiral wound and hollow fiber [2]. the literature contains several articles pertinent to ro desolation plants. examples are: dejebjian et al. [3] examined the five year collected from an ro plant in egypt to investigate the effect of the design and the operations conditions on performance of the plant. the findings confirmed the sensitivity of plant’s performance to changes in feed water temperature, salinity and pressure. meanwhile, guozhao et al.

It is particularly suited in countries under water stress and with limited energy resources. Since the objective is to minimize the downtime of RO plant under study, the reliability has to be maintained at highest level by designing it at high level and use the top materials for the different subsystems. Additionally, subsystems redundancy is critical because any failure in this system will stop the whole plant. Analysis indicated that the inclusion of an energy recover turbine lowers the availability of the system besides being costly.

Thus, Abu Dhabi Agriculture and Food Safety Authority was used as the case study. The results showed that power distance mediates the relationship between continuous improvement, employee involvement) and organizational performance and therefore the performance of the Abu Dhabi Agriculture and Food Safety Authority also influenced by the continuous improvement and employee involvement directly. These findings are in line with the results of Al-Ettayyem & Al-Zu’bi (2015), Goetsch, & Davis (2013), Hoang, Igel, & Laosirihongthong, (2010), Fotopoulos & Psomas (2010). Likewise, the research results show that there is a positive relationship between (customer satisfaction, continuous improvement, teamwork, top management commitment) and organizational performance (financial) in the Jordanian banking sector, this result is supported by Chen, Liu, Sheu & Yang, (2012). Furthermore, Ghadiri et al., (2013) their findings revealed that the hypothesis test indicate that there was a meaningful relationship between the total quality management and financial performance. Ngambi & Nkemkiafu, (2015); Machimbi, (2017); Al-Damen, (2017); Androwis, Sweis, Tarhini, Moarefi, & Hosseini Amiri, (2018); Worlu & OBI (2019) have agreed that total quality management dimensions positively affect organizational performance. Alghamdi (2018) argued that firms implementing TQM with more advanced performance measurement systems especially those that include financial and non-financial measures have higher performance. Ehsan Jabbarzare (2019) concluded that all of the selected TQM practices (continuous improvement, customer focus, and employee involvement) are significantly correlated with the organizational performance of hotels. This result also supported by Norah Dhafer Al- Qahtani, Sabah Sa’ad Alshehri, (2016) and Chepkech & Cheluget (2017). Also, the current study findings on the mediating role of the power distance supported by the results of Mardani & Jusoh, (2012) who used two of Hofstede’s (1983) national culture dimensions and the six values of total quality management. The sample was collected from 150 managerial personnel of Iranian small and medium enterprises (SME’s) in 30 companies. The survey result is an analysis by regressing cultural dimensions on total quality management values. Their results suggest that power distance is the most influential cultural element and impacts all six total quality management values and masculinity has no significant effect on total quality management values except emphasis on total quality management-oriented training Mardani & Jusoh, (2012). Limitation and Recommendation The scope of the current study was only limited to a single organization; it is therefore recommended that future research extend with the study’s scope with larger samples to include more organizations around the UAE which would help the enhancement and generalization of the outcomes. Also, future research should examine the TQM practices and relationship with innovation performance with other constructs in different settings. In addition, future research should measure the innovativeness of the organization including the product and service innovation within the limitations of the specific organization. Another limitation was that organization performance tenets were Proceedings of the 11th Annual International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management Singapore, March 7-11, 2021","authority abdulla esam alhamd1, mohd yamani bin yahya2 abdullaesam912@gmail.com, yamani@uthm.edu.my department of technology management, faculty of technology management and business, universiti tun hussein onn malaysia (uthm) parit rajah, batu pahat, johor, malaysia","References

The said scanning tool used six OWASP security requirements (MASVS) and using this standard, the specific issues and vulnerabilities, and their corresponding assessment statuses were identified. Based on the survey on the parents, the top three most used parental control applications were revealed, and these are Family Time, Family Link, and OurPact. All these three have their set of security issues detected, ranging from the severity level, 'Low' to 'High'. The total number of vulnerabilities detected in the three mentioned applications ranges from 12 to 16. Out of those vulnerabilities, they have 10 vulnerabilities that are common to each other which are mostly having ‘Moderate’ to ‘High’ severity levels.

602,"Let'S Go Phishing: A Phishing Awareness Campaign Using  Smishing, Email Phishing, And Social Media Phishing Tools","the phishing attacks have been drastically rising in numbers in several platforms such as personal and business emails, short message services (sms), and the emerging tactic that is through social media accounts. with the vulnerability of social engagement and trust in relationships, the study will show how phishing attacks are easily done with just minimal rapport in comparison to unknown senders and promotional links. the creation of a fake phishing website has been done and sent to 107 people - 46 via email, 37 via social media chat, and 24 via sms. data collection has been done through the use of the open-source phishing framework gophish for monitoring the links sent via email, google analytics for links sent via social media chat, and a link click counter for links sent via sms. the results have shown that out of the three types of phishing methods used, social media phishing is where the targeted users are most vulnerable on which has a 24 out of 46 (52.17%) success rate, compared to email phishing which has 6 out of 37 (16.22%) success rate and smishing which has a 1 out of 24 (4.17%) success rate.","phishing, smishing, email phishing","A Post-Experience Survey has been distributed to 23 targeted users, 8 Email Phishing targeted users (5 who clicked the link, and 3 who did not click the link), 12 Social Media targeted users (9 who clicked the link, and 3 who did not click the link), and 3 smishing targeted users (1 who clicked the link, and 2 who did not click the link). The results show that trust is the greatest factor in why the targeted users have clicked the link. This shows that even if their devices or browsers have high levels of security, their interaction, closeness, and trust in other people is their greatest vulnerability. Curiosity is the next factor in why the targeted users have clicked the link. This shows that persuading skills can be a significant characteristic of a penetration tester when dealing with other people, because getting their curiosity can be a way for them to disclose their information. The Post-Experience Survey shows that 13 out of 15 (86.67%) target users did not receive any warning messages upon opening the phishing link. This shows that hosting a fake website on an online hosting application that has a legitimate domain can easily be sent via social media, email, and SMS. If the users trust the sender of the fake website, their sensitive information can easily be gathered. On the other hand, suspicion is one of the ways that a user can be protected from opening a malicious link. The Post-Experience Survey shows that 6 out of 8 (75%) target users have answered that they did not click the link because of their suspicion. This shows that clarifying when suspicion happens can be an additional layer of security for people especially for phishing attacks. 2 out of 15(13.33%) target users had an encounter with a warning webpage upon accessing the link. These users have used Facebook Messenger to access the given link. This shows that Facebook Messenger has a level of security upon sending phishing links. Conclusively, the target users have a 4.6 Mean Value on the answers on the Likert Scale about their rating on the phishing awareness campaign conducted by the researchers, which falls under the Strongly Agree range. This shows that the target users have an overall positive attitude on the process of the phishing campaign.

Organizations that do not fully understand the synergy between 5S and other LM tools face many obstacles when implementing 5S resulting in high chances of failure. The long-term prosperity and sustainability of the 5S method for an organization first requires an analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the approach and correct methods to properly utilize the 5S concept. A success in 5S changes the production to achieve zero changeovers, defects, wastes, delays, injuries, breakdowns, complaints and red ink. The Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) improves when a full 5S program is implemented together with Total Productive Maintenance (TPM) and empowering of shop floor workers to make decisions. The holistic benefits of the 5S are enjoyed in LM when all the barriers associated with implementation of the technique are removed. The availability and management of resources, provision of clear procedures and plant layouts greatly devour the barriers. Delegating responsibilities and the power of decision making to staff guarantee a strong impact on successful completion of each task. It reinforces on employee motivation and validation of the investments required. The lack of expertise affects several fields like computer science and information flow.

Therefore, students who are in need of computer programs with subscription fees that can be used for their school work are vulnerable to a social engineering attack. Having such findings, it was concluded that more than half of the students know how to examine and check all the files they have downloaded in the internet before installing them. Most of them also have anti-virus installed in their laptop but cannot detect the malware from the file they have downloaded. Therefore, students know some ways how to protect themselves from malicious software that are harmful for their computers. In relation to the answer of respondents, most of the students are aware about social engineering attacks and that it is one way to send harmful files or programs to their computers without realizing that they have been compromised.

This software provides the user-friendly interface which can be assessed by anybody without any software knowledge. The developed software not only provides a basic awareness about ergonomics but also guides the user to access ergonomic tools for their activities. It also contains the ISO standards and guidelines which are helpful for manufacturing industries to follow them as a guideline to minimize the work-related ergonomic issue in their industries. It is one of its kind software which can not only be used to gain knowledge about ergonomics but also can be used to evaluate, assess tasks and provide necessary guidelines. To evaluate its capabilities, an example of the Sawmill is considered. Initially the workplace is studied by learning the fundamentals of ergonomics from module 1 of the KBSEAM software. Later the evaluation of the work is carried out using the module 3 of the software. It contain the various assessment tools from which, the REBA tool is used to assess the MSDs issue in lifting and carrying the wooden logs. This issue is solved by using the standard and guideline module of the software. The guidelines are provided in the software, in which various lifting and transporting devices are mentioned which can be used for lifting the heavy load from one place to another in sawmill. This reduces the strain on the worker’s body thereby reducing the MSDs issues among the Sawmill workers.","1sonasale priti, 2hebbal s.s, 3qutubuddin s.m industrial and production engineering department p d a college of engineering, kalaburagi 1priti.sonasale@gmail.com 2shivahebbal@gmail.com 3syedqutub16@gmail.com",

612,Analyzing The Open Electricity Market In Singapore Using  Data Science Approaches,"the open electricity market in singapore (oem) was soft launched in april 2018 by the energy market authority (ema). as a form of further deregulation in singapore’s electricity industry, the oem was established to further promote competition and innovation in the power industry. apart from the default retailer, sp services ltd, households are given the opportunity to select their preferred electricity retailer. with the increasing competition from growing retailers, this study analyses and predicts the market shares of the available retailers using descriptive statistics and creating a multiple linear regression model. out of the identified six retailers, this study is able to obtain predictive modelling equations for sp services, keppel electric and senoko energy supply’s market shares through elimination of variables of no statistical significance.","market shares, prediction","With the heavy reliance on electricity in today’s world, Singapore’s electricity market is expected to grow and improve to keep up with this increasing demand. With the implementation of further deregulation in the household-targeted electricity retail market, the effects of liberalization are prominent. No longer being solely reliant on the default retailer (SP Services), new key players have entered and even dominated the market. This study implements the use of descriptive statistics to explore the variables behind the growth of the electricity market. The results indicate that the launch of the OEM has catalyzed the growth of these new key players to such a large extent that it has resulted in an almost-perfect competitive market, with the HHI decreasing steadily over the years. The market shares of key players in the electricity market have also shown greater fluctuations and will definitely continue to change in the future. Additionally, this study applies a multiple regression linear model for retailers to better identify the variables that are of most importance to their market shares. First, this model incorporates a large number of variables related to the electrical consumption growth in the household sub-sector as independent variables. Second, a stepwise elimination approach is applied for each retailer to identify only statistically significant variables. As such, a customized multiple regression equation is formed for each retailer. Out of the six identified electricity retailers, this study managed to obtain predictive modelling equations for SP Services, Keppel Electric as well as Senoko Energy. Results from the multiple regression model have too corresponded to the trends identified in Figures 1-8. With the identified independent variables revolving around the electrical consumption in household sub-sectors, the variables have proved insignificant to the remaining three retailers, which targets larger consumers. However, this study precludes the consideration of external factors that could affect future electrical consumption in households such as the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic. A partial equilibrium analysis could be incorporated to better investigate the supply and demand in the electricity market. Nonetheless, this model has allowed the examination of the relationship between the market shares of electricity retailers and the electrical consumption within the household sub-sector.

613,An Integrated Project Design For Improving The  Performance Of Small And Medium Enterprise: A Case,"in this case study, we discussed the small and medium-sized enterprise (sme) mushroom that has problems about financial as well as technical problems. in financial aspects, the sme does not have correct financial records to determine a selling price. in technical problems, it faced the absence of product certification as proven a product fulfill a standard that required by the market. this situation made sme's performance not good, even though these products are needed by the market. this study aims to improve the sme in technical and non-technical aspects. we use similar (state the problem; investigate alternatives; model the system; integrated; and re-evaluate) approaches to develop an integrated project design. we investigated that in practice, there are still many smes that have not kept their accounting books and reports properly. the implementation of accounting bookkeeping to provide informative financial reports is still difficult for smes. smes products that have a guarantee will have a higher selling value than similar products that do not have certification. smes need to meet good food production methods for home industry (industri rumah tangga/irt), halal standards and meet food safety aspects. therefore, it is measured on the object of study which refers to the irt standard. measurements are made to measure the incompatibility of the irt that occurs, then corrections are made based on the mismatch and maintain food safety in the production process. several alternative solutions that are implemented will provide smes results that are by the technical standards of oyster mushrooms’ house, and are entitled to apply for good food production method for home industry cppb-irt) and sak emkm certifications.","sme’s, strategic planning, financial, trade","This research has produced alternatives to improve the performance of SMEs and solve existing problems. SME problems are resolved by improving production processes, controlling environmental factors, improving CPPB-IRT, and passing CPPB-IRT audits.

614,Impact Of Cultural Behavior On The Bullwhip Effect In The  Covid-19 Pandemic,"with the broadening of interconnection between national borders, it is paramount to take into account different cultural behavior to enhance the visibility and integration among supply chain partners with the aim to improve organizational performance. there are a few studies exploring the role of culture in supply chain coordination and buyer-supplier relationships that results in the bullwhip effect, but they consider simulation environments or real-life scenarios with minor perturbation. therefore, this study complements the literature by analyzing how the perception of large disruptions in supply chain coordination varies between cultures. more specifically, this paper will investigate the behavioral causes of bullwhip effect during the covid-19 pandemic to illustrate how these disruptions affect the supply chain coordination. the hofstede’s cultural dimensions theory and other three studies were considered when elaborating and applying a multiple-case study approach with semi-structured interviews and podcasts as the main source of data. the results provided a framework of the relation between cultural differences and the bullwhip effect in large disruptions, with the confirmation of a few tendencies that were observed from previous studies, and elaboration of propositions and managerial applications.","bullwhip effect, cultural behavior, service level","on how organizations can adjust to differences in culture and behavior to enhance their supply chain coordination in large disruption scenarios. Operational efficiency in collectivist cultures demands for a strategic shift, whereas individualist cultures do not prioritize trust-based relations (Cannon et al. 2010). Considering the findings and propositions elaborated, it can be suggested that supply chain partners from countries with higher individualism levels might adjust their behavior with processes standardization and technology implementation, such as RFID or artificial intelligence systems, to reduce the constraints of in-person or manual collaboration along the chain. Organizations located in cultures that present a short-term orientation must endeavor building long-term involvement with their partners since this is essential to enhance collaboration and information sharing, as it was pointed by Doetzer (2020). Increasing data sharing, and hence the supply chain visibility, among the partners is indispensable for reducing uncertainty and improving the network coordination, which directly minimizes the Bullwhip Effect. 5.3 Future Research Cross-cultural research involves a wide spectrum of outcomes and patterns, with several nuances that need to be carefully examined before reaching further conclusions. It is paramount to consider that the divergences identified might be a consequence from organizational culture differences and there is an economic and infrastructural gap between the countries in analysis that might interfere in the perception of problems gravity and solution attitude. A strategy to further elaborate on the current findings and improve the sample size of this study is the adoption of a mixed method approach with the creation of a questionnaire with close ended questions that can be sent to a larger poll of respondents, such as it was executed in Tong et al. (2017), with further hypothesis testing and statistical analysis to add value to the results. An interesting research direction can be extracted from the Canadian podcast. Richard Markoff mentioned that the Bullwhip Effect is not affecting the supply chains as much as a phenomenon called Inventory Bounce. For future research, it will be relevant to incorporate the investigation about this phenomenon with the objective to study its nuances and relationship with behavior and culture aspects in the BWE. This study provided indications of the relevance of national culture for improving supply chain coordination which opens doors to further research in the field. Although the Hofstede cultural dimensions theory is widely adopted in operations and supply chain management cultural studies, future research can explore other perspectives in dissimilar cultural behavior, such as the one presented in the GLOBE project (House et al. 2002). 6. Conclusion The study has shown that it is paramount to understand cultural norms and values when developing supply chain relationship strategies. Business practitioners must be aware that trust, collaboration, information sharing, knowledge management and performance contribute to long-term and successful relationships between supply chain partners in individualist and collectivist cultures in different manners. Unexpected events bring more uncertainty to the relationships and require careful consideration to overcome the disruptions. This inductive study achieved its objective to provide a framework of the relation between cultural differences and the BWE in large disruptions, fulfilling the gap of how different cultures behave in decision-making under dramatic circumstances. Moreover, the study supplemented the behavioral causes of the BWE literature by conducting a multiple-case study with interviews and podcasts, rather than the usual Beer Distribution Game methodology.

From the analysis using the huff model to calculate the probability of a consumer's visit to the industrial center, the probability level between industrial centers is obtained. owned by the industrial center of the proposed location, namely in Krajan, Kauman Ponorogo Regency with a visiting probability of 81.09% and the lowest chance of visiting is owned by Santosa Jaya furniture with a probability of visiting 0.25% of the analysis results it is estimated that if an industrial center is established in that location facilitate access to transportation, improve customer service, refill finished goods faster, reduce transportation costs due to fewer routes, better monitor and manage raw material stocks. Approach with the center of gravity method is used to select a location that can minimize distance or cost to existing facilities. For example, it is used to select industrial center locations to supply goods to several furniture industries in a certain area. This approach selects one of the coordinates of the center point. Center of Gravity Techniques Is a mathematical technique used to find the best location for a single distribution point serving multiple furniture industries. This method takes into account the distance to the location of the furniture industry, the number of goods shipped.

618,Design Of Cashless Payment System With Rfid To Improve  Services Of School Canteen: A Case Study,"as we are in the midst of the covid-19 pandemic, people are coping up with the “new normal” and finding ways to prevent transmission of the virus. pen and paper has been replaced by automation that will make life much easier for all. radio frequency identification or rfid is a type of wireless technology that utilizes radio waves in order to transmit data. rfid systems include three parts which are rfid tags, rfid reader, and an antenna. the rfid reader and antenna combination sends out radio frequency energy in order to power up the chip in the rfid card for it to be able to transfer data. when this type of system is applied in payment transactions like in a cafeteria or canteen, it will help eliminate long queues and record inventory and sales within a short amount of time. this paper covers the opinions and views of the customers and concessionaires regarding the alternative approach to the current payment system of using cash in transactions into a cashless transaction system using rfid technology. the researchers used survey questionnaires that made use of the likert scale in order to gather data and analyze the results. the paper shows comparison between the current and proposed processes and highlights the process which can be eliminated in order to improve the current payment system. furthermore, the study includes a prototype design of the payment system with rfid technology.","covid-19, rfid, canteen","RFID is known for its cashless basis transaction on every tollway that the people are driving in, one of its features is the convenience it provides for all the drivers in the country. And with the idea of the researchers to bring it to the cafeteria of the university, it has gained potential as based on the study conducted. With all the results provided, the satisfaction of the students and the concessionaires will definitely increase in time once the said system which is the RFID based payment system in the cafeteria of the HEI’s is going to be implemented in the near future. Given all the benefits that RFID can provide inside the vicinity, a lot of the customers gladly said that with the production of the said payment system it can have the ability to attain the highest potential of the cafeteria inside the university. The different features of the RFID based payment system will include the contactless transaction which can be very beneficial for the university and mostly after this pandemic that the people are encountering nowadays. One feature also is focused on the security of the customers and also the concessionaires itself; one factor that the system gave the students is its ability to track and record their transaction within the day which is also very efficient for the students and the accurate and efficient reports that it can provide for the concessionaires. The results on the survey conducted by the researchers are based on the ideas and opinions of both the customers and concessionaires on the implementation of the RFID based transaction system for the cafeteria, the outcome of the said survey attained positive feedbacks regarding the benefits of implementing the RFID technology to the cafeteria, some responses contained high development of sales and security of the customers while on the other hand, for the concessionaires; they stated that it would affect customer satisfaction and the growth of not only the university but also the cafeteria . As per the results of the study, it was analyzed that this specific technology which is the RFID technology- based Transaction System in HEI’s will greatly affect its growth and development as a full standard and competitive university among the others. It was also said that this certain implementation will solely benefit the satisfactions of both the concessionaires and the students of the university.","roland jay-ar r. espinosa, aiden lemuel t. lumibao, chloe ysabel p. zerrudo, grace lorraine d. intal school of information technology mapua university, manila philippines rjrespinosa@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, altlumibao@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, cypzerrudo@mymail.mapua.edu.ph,gldintal@mapua.edu.ph",

620,Park Model Using Concentrated-Solar-Power Photovoltaics,"the energy harvesting system called the csp otherwise known as the concentrated solar power, are being used to supply energy in a large scale, where the system is being placed in an open, dry, and unclouded area. however, using this system in an urban area still has not been done, as of right now. this project demonstrates a model of an eco-park that uses concentrated solar power onto a set of photovoltaics as its main source of energy, in this case specifically for the lighting. the solar panels are mounted on a pillar that is standing on a platform in the middle of the park surrounded by reflectors, which reflects the sunlight to the panels in order to harvest more energy from the sun. the electricity collected from the panels is then connected to a circuit that combines the cabling from the solar panels, which is then connected into a power bank to charge. and lastly to another circuit which distributes the electricity to the lights around the model. this csp photovoltaics system is aimed to provide an effective way of mounting solar panels in a vertical orientation as opposed to the conventional horizontal orientation as rooftops. vertical mounting of solar panels is more space efficient but requires a csp to provide better access to sunlight over the course of the day. by incorporating this system in an urban setting, especially in under-developed countries such as indonesia, it is hoped that a cleaner and cheaper energy access can be available.","photovoltaics, alternative energy, solar panels",,"darren johanes manua grade 10 sph applied science academy sekolah pelita harapan lippo village tangerang, banten darrenmanua@gmail.com eden steven sph applied science academy sekolah pelita harapan lippo village tangerang, banten eden.steven@sph.ac.id",
621,Resilient Capacity Of Malaysian Schools’ Headteachers In  Adversity: A Review,"educational leaders faced twin challenges of responding to unprecedented community needs while managing radical changes within their own organizations and across the ministry of education plan and action. within a few weeks in march 2020, education in malaysia changed with unimaginable speed and scope, paralleling earlier experiences across the world. the pandemic amplified the urgency of action taken in education sector. face to face learning is at stake, curriculum has been simplified and public examination for primary school was postponed. somehow school leaders especially primary schools need to manage the school effectively. multiple decisions needed to be made, communicated, implemented, and managed which need resilience capacity. in this article, we describe some key resilient elements identified and lessons from experiences as primary school headteachers during this time and within the future to foresee. we draw some experienced from the six high-performing primary school headteachers in malaysia and two from the expertise. there were broad criteria of resilient leaders in primary schools. the criteria fall into categories of leadership whereby resilience capacity within the school leaders towards the school organization, parents, community and stakeholders have to be considered. the consequences of these responses resulted in a renewed recognition for school leaders to be resilient and ingenuity of teachers and primary school students. we provide examples of these lessons, themes and make recommendations for how to manage the school in the “new normal’ of living with covid-19 and global challenges to be prepared with the unprecedented incident which might happens in modern times.","school leaders, high-performing",,"hamidah che abdul hamid, *puspa liza ghazali, ahmad firdause, nik hazimi mohammed foziah and eni noreni mohamad zain faculty of business and management, universiti sultan zainalabidin. 21300 kualanerus, terengganu.malaysia. hamidahcheabdulhamid3366@gmail.com, puspaliza@unisza.edu.my, firdause@unisza.edu.my, nikhazimi@unisza.edu.my, noreni@umk.edu.my sukono universitas padjadjaran, bandung. west java. indonesia sukono@unpad.ac.id abdul talib bon department of production and operations, university tun hussein onn malaysia, malaysia talibon@gmail.com *corresponding author: puspaliza@unisza.edu.my",

623,"Covid-19 Vaccine Track And Traceability System  Warattra Singkarin, Kwinyarut Poungsangthanakul, Kunyapak Teekakun","logistics and supply chain play a very important role in business and industry these decades. track and traceability is one of the key components in making supply and chain more efficient. furthermore, in healthcare supply chain, track and traceability must be in place to ensure the safety of patients at the downstream. while all sectors in the world have the massive impacts from the covid-19 pandemic, the world is starting to realize the importance of vaccine and it eventually becomes the only hope of the humanity. hence, the vaccine supply chain becomes the major concerns in the healthcare sectors. temperature control throughout the supply chain activities e.g. storage, transportation and distribution are vital. thus, not only tracking location and activity, temperature must also be monitored. each of every vaccine has its own storage temperature in order to remain its quality and efficiency. one of the examples is our expectation covid-19 vaccine. the sources reveal that the temperature storage range can be varied from -70 to 25 degree celsius. from the authors’ previous research, we identified problems about the supply chain and the certain requirement for the storage temperature of vaccine. then, we invented the substitution of traditional ice pack used in nowadays’ transportation to the liquid nitrogen cooling system. the research was concluded that liquid nitrogen has better performance in both terms of temperature stabilization and the period of time keeping temperature within desired range. however, our previous vaccine cold box by liquid nitrogen did not have the ability to track and trace the location nor monitoring the temperature real time. thus, in this study, an effort is made to develop the covid-19 vaccine track and traceability system. firstly, the iot system will be implemented. rfid tag with temperature sensor will be applied in the cold box. then, the reader will collect the data and send to cloud server. at this point, the temperature data will be forwarded into two directions. one is to control the solenoid valve which is located in the cold box for releasing liquid nitrogen to the right amount wanted. another is to display and collect the real time temperature at the dash board for the temperature monitoring. moreover, the previous study’s calculation process has shown that there is another factor related to the length of time vaccine cold box could maintain temperature within range. it is the thermal conductivity rate of the material used for the exterior of the cold box. we can easily increase the length of time by using the material with lower thermal conductivity rate. after the cold box is built, we will set experiments to test the efficiency of the system, collect and analyze the data before the conclusion is reached.","covid-19 vaccine, track and trace",,"and pramote namyang satriwithaya school bangkok, thailand wsingkarin@gmail.com , kwinyarut2546@gmail.com , 10903kunyapak@gmail.com and pramotenamy@gmail.com",
624,Biaxial Tensile Test System: Articular Cartilage Properties  In Biaxial Vs. Uniaxial Tension,"b ackground. the articular cartilage of the femoral condyles is at the distal end of the femur and is a main load- bearing tissue of the knee. during skeletal growth, the condyles expand substantially, increasing in diameter in humans by ~54% from age 11 to skeletal maturity. during such growth, articular cartilage stretches biaxially, including in the anterior-posterior and medial-lateral directions. however, most previous studies of articular cartilage tensile properties have used a uniaxial configuration. h ypothesis & aims. we hypothesised that a biaxial stretch device would reveal that the tensile properties of articular cartilage are affected by stretch in both of the orthogonal axes. thus, the aims of this study were (1) to develop a biaxial test system, and (2) to use the device to test if biaxial and uniaxial tensile properties of articular cartilage are different. m ethods. a biaxial test instrument was constructed to allow application of displacement and measurement of load along both vertical and horizontal axes. the system consisted of a scaffold system, pulleys, and two electronic scales. the scaffold provided a rigid vertical test frame with a horizontal cross-bar. along the vertical axis, stretch was controlled by manual advancement of the cross bar along threaded rods, with load measurement via a scale underneath. along the horizontal axis, stretch was controlled by manual movement of lines, redirected by pulleys, one of which pulled against a scale for load measurement. cross-shaped samples were attached to the test instrument via four lines, two vertical and two horizontal, attached to clamps that secured the sample. an articular cartilage sample was tested in uniaxial and biaxial tension. a porcine knee joint was obtained from a local butcher. an articular cartilage specimen, with the articular surface intact, was isolated by dissecting out a cruciform shape and undercutting the articular cartilage to release a sample with an (8.1mm)2 central region, four (8.1mm)2 arms with ~2mm for grasping, and a thickness of 1 mm. samples were subjected to (1,2) uniaxial tests, in the (1) vertical and (2) horizontal directions, and (3) a biaxial test, with strains of 0% or 18%, 36%, or 54% in along one or both axes according to the test. photographs and loads were recorded after each test increment. r esults. the desired strains (±1%) were achieved by adjusting the loading lines. the uniaxial loads (in newtons) at 18, 36, and 54% extension were 7.74±1.24, 21.07±0.69, and 45.57±7.62 in the stretch direction and much lower 1.67±0.42 (-78%), 5.38±0.54 (-74%), and 10.07±2.46 (-78%) in the orthogonal direction (held at 0 extension). the biaxial loads in the stretch direction were substantially larger, 8.38±0.62 (+8%), 24.31±0.42 (+15%), and 61.25±6.24 (+34%) n, respectively. d iscussion. these results (1) establish a simple but functional biaxial tensile test system, and (2) confirm preliminarily that loads along the stretched axis are much greater with biaxial than uniaxial testing. additional samples are currently being tested.","biomechanics, cartilage, biaxial, uniaxial",,"aadi biswas 10th grade, singapore american school (high) singapore, 738547, singapore aadibiswas1@gmail.com van w. wong, b.s., albert c. chen, ph.d., robert l. sah, m.d., sc.d. department of bioengineering university of california, san diego la jolla, california, 92093 united states of america vwong@ucsd.edu, acchen@ucsd.edu, rsah@ucsd.edu",
625,Evaluation Of Factors Affecting Air Cargo Terminal  Operation Performance During Covid-19,"covid-19 affecting to aviation industry in many aspects, not only in passenger side, but also in air cargo. this crisis impacts a lot on air cargo capacity due to the change in actual flight movements. the operation process needs to be change according to the new law and regulation and to comply with who. the problem raised when volume of air cargo is unstable which affect to management planning. this paper analyzed (1) how pandemic disease impact shipping and cargo operations and (2) significant factors affecting to air cargo terminal process due to covid-19. evaluating the factors that has a significant impact to air cargo terminal operation performance is main contribution for this paper. using mcdm technique, best-worst methods, to identify and rank the factors. as a result, manpower and handling process are the top factors affected from pandemic disease. to answer the research questions, this paper revealed two contributions; first the industry would understand the current situation and the factors that need to be solve first. second, this paper also provides the policy and practice for practitioner in order to utilize air cargo capacity.","logistics, covid-19","In according to Table 6, to enable cargo terminal operational performance during this trying time, the operators shall seriously look into these first three factors to enhance handling performance. Manpower, Handling process, and Cut- off time are respectively significant to all relevant stakeholders especially cargo terminal operators. With this difficult time, most of the aviation company reducing its cost by laying off stuffs. This decision effect to human resource management. When manpower resource is becoming shortage, air cargo terminal must optimize the existing amount of manpower in order to cope up with the unstable demand. Handling a special vaccine also requires skillful manpower and handling process. This is totally impacting to service quality and handling flow provided to shippers, consignees, and carriers. In addition, as mentioned earlier, time is matter to air cargo transport to satisfy shippers. To transport products by air is lesser carrying capacity while more expensive logistics cost, shippers will ship their goods by air when goods is very important to arrive at the desired time to destinations and shorter time is preferably significant. Shorter cut- off time is helpful to shippers to have times to transport just finished goods from manufacturers to airports, especially when COVID-19 vaccine is ready to ship. This is the nature of air cargo after its production process. If cargo terminal operator agrees on shorter cut-off time meaning that the in-house handling process must be faster and more efficient to deliver to aircraft side on time. Therefore, cargo terminal is mandatory to review their handling procedure to fasten airline transit/transfer time. Proper handling service is necessary to be well-performed by cargo terminal operators to airlines. As the top three factors are somehow relevant to timing required by airlines. Cargo terminal shall seriously consider these three factors in order to satisfy airlines, shippers, freight forwarders and consignees. The question is how to handle cargo with nil irregularity and faster in cargo terminal custody. This is important to cargo terminal to gain higher standard of their operational performance in all area of handling activities.

627,The Plausibility Of Recycling Used Tennis Strings As 3D  Printing Filament,,,"Based on the above experiment, polyester could be suitable as a replacement for 3D printing filament, however Nylon may not be. This is because Nylon filament oxidises, making it useless. Polyester melts completely, without oxidation, by 290 ℃. This is much higher than the melting point of PLA (160 ℃). Unfortunately, this means that printing with polyester filament would be energy inefficient in comparison to PLA. Polycarbonate-ABS (PC-ABS), another type of filament, prints at a comparable temperature to that of polyester. This indicates that polyester could potentially replace PC-ABS. This would need to be tested in a printer which is capable of printing at such temperatures (like the Stratasys F370 3D printer), however I currently do not have access to one. The uses of polyester as a substitute for PC-ABS is the topic of another article. I believe that as 3D printing gains wide acceptance, a critical feedstock for this can be provided by the sporting industry. This will make the sport more sustainable and benefit our planet. While I studied tennis strings, the methods presented are applicable to other racquet sports like squash and badminton.",,

631,Investigate The Effect Of Zinc On Depolymerized Pet,"polyethylene terephthalate (pet) is a common synthetic polymer material, which has a wide range of applications. however, with the overuse of humans, more and more pet the product was found to be improperly recycled. the alcoholysis method is a depolymerized pet method with simple reaction conditions, a mild reaction process, and less unnecessary by-products. also, the ester exchange reaction in the esterification reaction is combined with the alcoholysis method for the reaction. the alcohol used in this study-ethylene glycol (eg) can be esterified with the free acid. because zinc metal is an amphoteric substance, can catalyze the reaction and produce new esters and new alcohols. use zinc in waste batteries as a catalyst to depolymerize pet into monomer polyethylene terephthalate (bhet) and discuss in-depth the factors affecting the reaction and its development and application. using zinc from waste batteries as a catalyst is not only low cost, but also more in line with the core of this research-green chemistry. this research has searched through optimal conditions and found that 5 grams of pet can be depolymerized when the catalyst usage is 0.2 grams, the reaction time is 4 hours, and the reaction temperature is 180 degrees. keyword alcoholysis method, pet, catalyze, waste batteries, polyethylene terephthalate 1. introduction in addition to reducing people’s space for activities, improperly handled plastic products will also have a series of effects on marine life. for example, in southern thailand, the death of a whale caused national mourning. i have accidentally eaten more than 85 plastic bags of garbage, and the endangered finless porpoise and short-nose dolphins have also been found eating plastic in thailand many times. back in taiwan, the coastal garbage per kilometer is 2.4 times that of japan and 1.7 times that of south korea. there are as many as 13 large black garbage bags per 100 meters proceedings of the 11th annual international conference on industrial engineering and operations management singapore, march 7-11, 2021 © ieom society international 6740",,"Through comparison with other polyester recycling methods, it is understood that the alcoholysis method is more environmentally friendly and efficient than other methods. According to the literature discussion, it is known that zinc metal can be used as a catalyst to accelerate the reaction. In this study, we used self-dismantling of the waste battery to collect the zinc shell of the battery and cut it to use as a catalyst to try to catalyze the depolymerization of PET. Experimental research can indeed use zinc metal as a catalyst to depolymerize PET. Put the sample to be tested into DSC and then the system starts to heat up to the temperature you want to set, and observe the weight loss and heat flow change of the sample during this period of time, and the heat flow of the sample Change to determine the melting point of the sample. The characteristic peak of the melting point of the product falls near 110°C, which is consistent with BHET. Therefore, it can be determined that the product of this study is indeed PET monomer BHET.

637,Identification Of Critical Success Factor For Sustainable  Supply Chain Management Drone Logistics In Indonesia,"infrastructure indonesia in building national competitiveness and to support the implementation of the master plan for the acceleration and expansion of indonesian economic development 2011 – 2025. the main thing is logistics in urban areas, because urban logistics has a function as a link in national networks as well as global networks. the main cause in urban areas is road congestion, resulting in delays, in addition to environmental impacts such as carbon dioxide emissions. to overcome this, this study analyzes a new mode of transportation with new technology, namely drones. a drone is an unmanned aerial vehicle or unmanned aerial vehicle (uav). this drone technology can be a solution for the logistics system to be efficient. a sustainable supply chain is one that is better at identifying current and future environmental and social impacts and finding ways to reduce them. environmental and social impacts are important in this industrial 4.0 era, especially for new technologies that will enter the indonesian market. this research focuses on the objective of identifying the critical success factors (csf) to implement the sustainability of the application of logistic drones as a mode of delivery in urban areas in indonesia, to determine the contextual relationship between csfs. the method used in this study is to use a structural hierarchy model (ism). the results obtained were that there were 8 levels out of a total of 18 csfs identified. level 8, the most important is the global marketing factor, where this factor aims to provide a competitive advantage in the global marketing space by implementing a green supply chain. these results can be a recommendation to the government and business people to focus on the most influential factors for the success of a logistics drone business in indonesia.",drone logistics,"The ISM model to identify CSFs in logistics drone implementation in Indonesia has been carried out. Taking into account 18 CSFs from 6 identified factors. The results obtained were that there were 8 levels out of a total of 18 CSFs identified. Level 8, the most important is the global marketing factor, where this factor aims to provide a competitive advantage in the global marketing space by implementing a green supply chain. Level 7 is also important, followed by the factors of Corporate Social Responsibility, Regulations and standards, Low Initial Cost, and Skilled Workforce. So it can be said that Organizational Factors, Business Environmental Factors, Regulatory Factors, and Economic Factors are important in the successful implementation of logistic drones in Indonesia. However, due to the limitations of researchers, the respondents in this study were still limited, and there were no respondents from the government. A disadvantage of this study is not yet consideration with other modes of transportation, such as motorcycles online, and other expeditions. So that this can be considered in future research, so that the results match the real conditions and can be used as recommendations to the city government for the application of drone logistics to support the national logistics system.

638,Proposed Design Of Ergonomic Roof Tile Transportation  Equipments In Bekonang Roof Tile Company,"life in a fast-paced era demands a company to increase its productivity. one of them is the bekonang roof tile company which is located in sukoharjo, central java. the demand is quite stable and allows an increase in demand production, requiring bekonang roof tile company to carry out the process more efficiently. however, in the process of making roof tiles, there are still less efficient activities, namely in the material handling process for wet tile transportation. the material handling process is only done manually, using only 2 hands by the operator. this condition can increase the damage during the wet tile transportation period because it can change the tile and also the tile is prone to falling. therefore, it is necessary to make ergonomic equipments to increase the productivity of the bekonang roof tile company. after adding the equipment for transporting tiles, within 12 minutes there were 135 tiles obtained more than not using equipment, namely 21 pieces.","roof tile company, ergonomic, transportation","After conducting research and problem solving, it can be concluded that: 1) One of the less efficient activities in the process of making this tile is the material handling process for transporting wet roof tiles. The material handling process is only done manually, using only 2 hands by the operator. This condition can increase the risk of damage during the wet tile transportation period because it can change the tile mold and is also prone to falling. In addition, from a time perspective, it is less efficient because the operator carries out repeated activities with only 2 tiles that can be transported and at the same time it takes up production time because the operator carrying out the transportation is the operator involved in the production process. 2) Several alternative solutions to solve the above problems are improving the layout of the facilities, increasing the number of operators, and designing transportation aids. The alternative chosen is the design of facility aids. This is because the repair process can be done at a lower cost and does not interfere with the production process. 3) With the improvement in the form of transportation aids simulated using arena software, it is estimated that there is a significant comparison where within 720 seconds, 78 tiles were obtained manually and 141 pieces with assistive devices.","amirul wika rosida, dwi puji astuti, farhan al azhar widyaputra, and widya puspitasari, r. hari seyanto, muhammad hisjam, roni zakaria department of industrial engineering, faculty of engineering, universitas sebelas maret surakarta, indonesia amirulwikarosida@student.uns.ac.id, astutidwipuji608@student.uns.ac.id, farhanfvz@student.uns.ac.id, widyapuspitasari75@student.uns.ac.id, hstyan97@gmail.com, hijam@staff.uns.ac.id, ronizakaria@staff.uns.ac.id",
639,Dynamic System Simulation Model For The Fulfillment Of  Soybean Logistics To Maintain Soybean Price Stability,"one of the industrial commodities made from agricultural raw materials that has the ability to compete is soybeans. the fluctuation of soybean commodity prices is a crucial issue in indonesia every year. the current problem is that the demand for soybeans continues to increase, but it cannot be matched by domestic production, local soybean production is still low and cannot meet demand. to fulfill it, imports were carried out which continued to increase every year. the dependence of soybeans on imported products has consequences on local soybean prices that are not able to compete, resulting in price instability. central java is one of the provinces that produces the second largest soybean in indonesia after east java. the problems involved in the logistics of the central java soybean supply chain appear to be interrelated, namely the price of imported soybeans is still low, the flow of imports is still high, so the price of soybean farmers is still priced cheaply, so farmers are not enthusiastic about planting soybeans. due to the low planting interest of farmers, the soybean production capacity will also decrease, the local soybean supply will decrease so that it is increasingly dependent on imports, import volumes will increase, local prices are increasingly unable to compete, farmer welfare decreases (demotivation), supply is increasingly reduced and the volatility of prices was getting out of control. this study will develop a dynamic system model for the fulfillment of soybean logistics which aims to maintain soybean price stability. researchers focus on examining the relationship between variables in the fulfillment of soybean logistics in central java, namely regarding the need for food (demand), the total availability of soybeans (supply) and the price of soybeans (distribution) using a dynamic system framework. this research is also expected to identify the determining factors in increasing the competitiveness of local soybeans to meet the needs and desires of consumers in the soy-based industry through policy simulations in an effort to increase the competitiveness of local soybeans on the national market and stabilize soybean commodity prices that can benefit two parties, namely producers and consumers. this study adds and considers post-harvest factors, competitor commodity price factors and output in the form of a decision support system (dss) application using powersim studio 10 software to support government and stakeholder decision making. the results of the model scenario can be used as supporting material for government decisions and stakeholders in strategy development and can use the results of these simulations to make strategic decisions.","soybean, price stability, system dynamic, simulation model",,"isna nugraha master program of industrial engineering, faculty of engineering universitas sebelas maret surakarta, indonesia isna.nugraha@student.uns.ac.id muhammad hisjam and wahyudi sutopo research group of industrial engineering and techno-economics department of industrial engineering, faculty of engineering universitas sebelas maret surakarta, indonesia hisjam@staff.uns.ac.id, wahyudisutopo@staff.uns.ac.id",

642,Shared Capacity Routing Problem For Buy-Online-Pickupin-Store Order Fulfillment,"buy-online-pickup-in-store (bops) is one of the omnichannel retailing models which is getting popularized nowadays (gallino & moreno, 2014; gallino, moreno, & stamatopoulos, 2017; gao & su, 2016; glaeser, fisher, & su, 2019; song,wang, liu, & li, 2020). motivated by complexities of bops environment, we propose a generalized model for the order fulfillment in bops retailing to minimize the delivery cost of the bops orders. a variant of the problem is characterized by paul, agatz, and savelsbergh (2019) and paul, agatz, spliet, and koster (2019). typically, the bops orders are delivered at the pick-up-points (pups), which are generally the traditional retail stores. the customer can order online and pick up the order from specified pups. big retailers like walmart and tesco are using the dedicated warehouse for the fulfillment of the online pup orders (delaney-klinger, boyer, & frohlich, 2003; hübner, kuhn, & wollenburg, 2016). the context allows that daily two vehicles visit the stores, one for replenishing the store inventory and the second for delivering the pup orders. the joint planning of both replenishment and pup routes is difficult due to operational constraints as replenishment routes are well planned in advanced and pup routes are planned much later because of the shorter lead time of the pup orders. however, there are possibilities of exploiting the spare vehicle capacity of the replenishment vehicle, by piggyback the pup orders on it, so that the total delivery cost of pup orders is minimized.","bops, omnichannel, transportation, capacity sharing",,"rajendra baraiya and rohit kapoor operations management & quantitative techniques department indian institute of management, indore prabandh-shikhar, rau-pithampur road, indore, madhya pradesh, india - 453556 f17rajendrab@iimidr.ac.in, rohitk@iimidr.ac.in",

If the visualization gives the business descriptive information, the models give the business predictive information that aids them to make decisions to optimize their business operations. The decision tree is one of the several models used by the business to classify and make predictions. Several businesses and industries had already recognized the benefits of using data science in their business which is why data science is becoming a trend.

Findings of this study revealed that: • Both LCC and FSNC passengers do not give importance to the quality level of Food Services. • Time management and Service Provided by Flight Attendants factors are the most important factors for FSNC passengers. FSNC company managers should assure on-time departure and arrival. They should also give importance to the quality level of in-flight services and perform service right the first time. • LCC passengers do not give too much importance to Service Provided by Flight Attendants factor but Service Provided by Airport Stuff factor is the most important factor. • LCC passengers are not as sensitive as FSNC passengers for the Time Management factor. • Facilities were also a very important factor for FSNC passengers. FSNC airline companies should make improvements in the modernization of their facilities.

647,Physical Assessment And Perceived Quality Of Ejeepney In Metro Manila,"the transportation sector made headway in terms of the service quality experienced by users of public utility vehicles like electric jeepneys through the modernization program regulated by the government. the gradual adaptation of e- jeepneys and promulgation on the operations concerning public road usage are governed based on the five principles of public transport which include criteria of reliability, safety, accessibility, environmental soundness, and comfort. at present, the electric jeepney is still in small stages in terms of public transit. with this, the study was conducted to measure the perceived quality of e-jeepney and validate the user’s perception through qualitative and quantitative assessments to be able to recommend improved specifications which will increase the user’s level of satisfaction. the assessment focused on go electric e-jeepney operating at paranaque integrated terminal exchange. using statistical analyses and link length system’s acceptability, the important findings of the study include passengers’ and driver’s low satisfaction level on comfort determinants among the indicators established and unaccommodated dimensions of the passenger cabin and workspace for driver whereas improved specification of design variables was proposed using relevant design tools. this can be concluded that the current e-jeepney does not mostly conform in terms of comfort criterion as confirmed on the results of the evaluation.","perceived quality, satisfaction level, indicators","The passengers and drivers were neither dissatisfied nor satisfied on the comfort experienced with the current design of E-jeepney and resulted continuous low satisfaction ratings from both respondents. Among the measurement indicators, safety criterion was rated by the passengers with the highest satisfaction rating and satisfied as perceived while it was service reliability for drivers. Most of the dimensions of the passenger cabin accommodated the corresponding population for each cabin part of the E-jeepney while the driver’s workspace obtained more unaccommodated standard dimensions which can be concluded that the driver’s scope required more improvements. It can also be concluded that the determinants used under each criterion are essential in the overall satisfaction rating of E-jeepney’s users since the behavior of the ratings given by the respondents reflect on the overall rating model. Lastly, most of the improvements on E-jeepney were in terms of comfort, environmental soundness, and accessibility whereas anthropometric principle was considered while other design input required compliance with operating equipment installed in E-jeepney to address reliability and safety.","ellaine c. villegas, niño chino b. ledres, and rene d. estember school of industrial engineering and service engineering management mapúa university 658 muralla st. intramuros, manila ecvillegas@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, ncbledres@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, rdestember@mapua.edu.ph",

649,Using Machine Learning Optimization To Predict Autism In  Toddlers,"autism is a developmental disorder that is often identified by complications with social interaction and communication. even though knowledge about it has increased and instruments such as the ados and adi are available to assess the disorder, it is usually distinguished from observable symptoms, which makes it especially difficult to diagnose. a variety of concerns arise because of this issue, one of them being long-term symptoms, which can be mitigated with early screening and consequently early treatment. this research focuses on improving the diagnosis pipeline of autism by training and testing several state-of-the-art machine learning models with an autism spectrum disorder dataset from the university of california, irvine, and using machine learning methods to quantitatively identify the most significant indicators of autism in toddlers. we first designed a neural network classification model and random forests classification model, and then we trained/tested them to identify the presence of autism in toddlers. we also used feature selection through lightgbm parameter optimization to identify which physical characteristics are most significant in giving rise to autism. the outcome of this study was a highly accurate classifier for predicting the presence of autism and significant information on the importance of several physical characteristics in indicating autism. this enhanced diagnosis is critical as it leads to a more personalized and early-stage treatment, which can alleviate the effects of autism thereafter.","machine learning, neural networks, random forests","In this study, novel research is performed regarding the detection of autism in toddlers. First, machine learning models were designed and optimized to achieve high performance in being able to detect autism in toddlers using physical, non-invasive data. Further, computational methods are used to quantitatively determine the importance of each physical feature. There are several notable takeaways from this work. First, it was observed that the standard neural network and optimized random forests model both achieved perfect fits on the testing set. This led us to conclude that standard machine learning models are sufficient to act as a reliable clinical decision justification system in the diagnosis of autism in toddlers. The most significant aspect of our work and the aspect that is a unique research contribution is the quantitative evaluation of the importance of the physical features used to detect autism. As discussed in Sections 5.1 and 5.2, we quantitatively identified the most to least significant features and drew inferences regarding the relation between physical characteristics and the presence of ASD. This information is significant because it is useful for clinicians to properly analyze results in order to determine whether a child has autism. Knowing, for example, that question A4 is significantly more indicative of ASD than question A10 or that the presence of Jaundice in a child has almost no statistical indication of ASD will be useful for helping a clinician make a more accurate and informed diagnosis for a child. Therefore, highly useful information for pediatricians that make autism diagnoses is uncovered in this study. Through or methodology, data collection, and analysis, we fully achieved both of our research objectives. We developed two highly accurate machine learning models to detect ASD in toddlers using only physical characteristics, and we quantitatively identified the physical characteristics that are the most significant indicators of ASD in toddlers.","arjun singh, zoya farooqui, branden sattler, unyime usua, michael helde arquest student science and engineering network irvine, ca arjsingh2004@gmail.com, zoya.farooqui@gmail.com, basattler2368@gmail.com, unyimecusua@gmail.com, michaelhelde11@gmail.com",
650,Croptimize: A Novel Robot To End Agricultural Yield  Inefficiencies Through Crop Switching,"problem statement/purpose: currently, many farmers plant crops that have grown well on their land for generations. however, climate change is starting to cause sizable decreases in crop yields. meaning, crops native to certain areas which previously flourished are now becoming less compatible to their environment. mit professor, arnaud costinot, found that roughly 66% of crop yield issues can be fixed by relocating farms or crop-switching. the purpose of croptimize is to allow farmers to determine the most optimal crop to grow on a certain plot of land and adapt to climate change’s negative effects on yields. it utilizes a mobile robot unit, a knn machine-learning algorithm, and environmental data to suggest the best crop(s) to grow in a certain region. methods: first, several data points regarding optimal conditions for growing several crops around the world were collected and put into a csv database. next, we assembled the robot. we gathered several sensors to test environmental conditions (soil ph, humidity, above-soil temperature, sunlight intensity, and npk nutrient concentration). we connected these sensors to an arduino mega using various breakout boards, which interprets the sensor data it collects and sends it to a raspberry pi through a serial connection. the raspberry pi uses the collected data to run the ml algorithm and outputs results to a database. we organized the components in a casing and added a chassis for mobility and autonomy. the robot was deployed at an open field in grant county park to collect data, and we used that data to determine the most fit crops for that plot by using a knn clustering algorithm. our algorithm cross-compares 200,000+ data points from our plant database with the data from the field; the plants from the database with the strongest correlation to the field’s conditions were outputted as the most suitable crops. croptimize provided accurate results due to its constant readings throughout the day, on different areas of the field. results: croptimize outputted a crop that best fit the tested plot of land. in our experiment, it outputted ‘spinach’ as the optimal crop for the following conditions: ph levels ranging from 6.5 to 7.1, above-soil temperature ranging from 56 to 74 degrees fahrenheit, roughly 8 hours of sunlight (at an average of 890 lux), and humidity levels ranging from 63% to 68%. when we tested different parts of the park on different days, the robot received different input values and outputted other fit crops for the plots of land. they included artichoke, cucumber, and guar bean. conclusions/discussion: the promising results of croptimize demonstrate the potential it has in reversing numerous inefficiencies in producing crop yields. by testing locations around the world, it can help farmers figure out what optimal crops they can switch to, and figure out where they can relocate their preexisting crop, such that it will grow better. through practices of crop-switching or relocating crops, which croptimize enables, farmers can adapt to the imminent and negative effects of climate change on crop yields. proceedings of the 11th annual international conference on industrial engineering and operations management singapore, march 7-11, 2021 © ieom society international 6932",,,"pranav palleti, shivam pathak, ashok devireddy, pranav prabhuram, sameer iyengar, sukhamrit singh, and ankit kapoor evergreen makers evergreen valley high school san jose, ca 95148, usa palletipranav4432@students.esuhsd.org, pathakshivam3712@students.esuhsd.org, devireddyashok4995@students.esuhsd.org, prabhurampranav6502@students.esuhsd.org, iyengarsameer4196@students.esuhsd.org, singhsukhamrit0431@students.esuhsd.org, kapoorankit5630@students.esuhsd.org","References

652,Kawaii Analysis On Education-Based Online Game On User  Behavior (Case Study: Jalasi 2 Application),"currently, the developments of education-based online games throughout the world including indonesia have increased sharply. accordingly, one of the latest online educational games in indonesia is called jalasi 2. this game offers many kawaii elements purposely designed to attract children to play this educational game. basically, this research is to test the hypotheses of h1: perceived kawaii on intention to use, h2: perceived ease of use on perceived satisfaction, h3: perceived usefulness on perceived satisfaction, and h4: intention to use on perceived satisfaction. after that, the study also tests the hypothesis of h5: perceived satisfaction on intention to use. the target consumers of jalasi 2 are indonesian children between the ages of 8 and 12. to know how many indonesian children are interested in the effect of kawaii in jalasi 2, analysis of theory reaction action (tra) and structural equation modeling (sem) was utilized using amos software. according to the structural model test, the results obtained by the perceived kawaii (pk) variable indicated a very significant effect on the intention to use (itu) by 1.339. this indicates that kawaii latent variable possesses an important role in jalasi 2 content, which can lure children’s interest in playing this game.","sem, tra, kawaii, educational game","Based on the results of studies in the field, which shows users behavior during interacting with educational games, respondents stated that kawaii-based educational games can attract users' attention. Respondents assessed that at the beginning of opening the JALASI 2 game display, starting from their eye view, then interacting with a focus on color combinations (kawaii characteristics), symbols, objects, people assimilated from native Japan to Indonesia, helps them to understand that JALASI 2 is an educational game. The findings of this study are valid and can be used as a basis for recommendations for further research. Regarding the role of kawaii in the JALASI 2 educational game, there are several supporting factors for kawaii that cause this game to be accepted by children, among others, are the advantages of the system and knowledge provided in JALASI 2. The results of this test are proven in terms of reusability, the respondents states that there are no system error that happens while the game is running. In terms of the usefulness of this educational game, it is obvious that, it provides more benefits to users with the existence of general knowledge outside the non-conventional learning system, namely formal learning in schools. The ease with which users interact in educational games will make it easier for players to understand games like educational games. This proof is very much needed to support children's sustainability to play educational games. Based on the testing of the SEM hypothesis, the results are as follows: 1. H1 is perceived kawaii on intention to use. It has still not been proven that there is a direct influence on intention to use. This test proves that the role of kawaii cannot immediately get users to play repeatedly. 2. H2 is perceived ease of use has an influence on perceived usefulness, this is related to the existing system in an educational game, whether when users play games experience problems with the system or not. The content of educational games, of course, lies in the questions given in the game, whether the user has previously read while studying at school or the knowledge provided is new knowledge for children. 3. H3 is the latent variable perceived usefulness has a strong positive effect on perceived satisfaction. These results prove the usefulness of a knowledge that is available. Children feel satisfied when they are playing educational games. 4. H4 is the latent variable intention to use has no effect on perceived satisfaction. This output cannot be proven in the reality of society.

(2) to determine the extent to which plantation sub-sector companies are listed on the stock exchange indonesia 2017- 2018 applies psak 69, both full and partial implementation. (3) to find out the comparison before and after the application of psak 69 in terms of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure. this research was conducted at plantation sub-sector companies listed on the indonesia stock exchange for the 2017-2018 period. the sample used in this study were 15 companies. the sample was selected using purposive sampling method. the analytical method used in this research is descriptive qualitative which functions as an analyzer of the data that has been collected. the analysis carried out resulted in several things that needed to be known, including that all the companies studied had started implementing psak 69 in the 2018 financial year. the company retrospectively applied psak 69, except for one company with the company code magp which was still implementing it partially. the comparison between before applying and after applying if viewed from the recognition, that is, before application an asset in the form of living things is recognized as a stock, whereas after application an asset in the form of a living thing is recognized as a biological asset. judging from the measurement, before application biological assets are measured at cost while after application are measured at fair value. judging from the presentation and disclosure, there is a reclassification of inventories to biological assets as well as restatement because there are gains or losses due to the application of psak 69.","psak_69, among others, raising livestock","This study aims to determine the analysis of the application of PSAK 69 agricultural accounting in the plantation sub-sector listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange (BEI) in 2017-2018. Based on the results of the analysis test conducted by the author, it can be concluded as follows. The application of agricultural accounting to Plantation Sub-Sector Companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange 2017-2018 is in accordance with PSAK 69. There are 15 companies in this study, all of which starting from January 1, 2018 have used PSAK 69 as a standard financial statement for assets biological. To what extent are the plantation sub-sector companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange in 2017-2018 implementing PSAK 69, either fully or partially. It is known that the fifteen companies listed on the stock exchange are applying PSAK 69 retrospectively, except for PT Multi Agro Gemilang Plantation Tbk. (MAGP) which still applies partially. Supported by the absence of a biological asset account in the statement of financial position, because in this company the application of PSAK 69 did not significantly affect its financial statements. Comparisons before and after the application of PSAK 69 in terms of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure are as follows: Judging from the recognition, in 2017, before the implementation of PSAK 69, all companies recognized assets in the form of living things as inventories. Meanwhile, in 2018, after the implementation of PSAK 69, all companies recognized assets in the form of living things as biological assets in current assets, except for PT Multi Agro Gemilang Plantation Tbk. (MAGP) which still recognizes assets in the form of living things as supplies. Judging from the measurement, in 2017, before the implementation of PSAK 69, all companies measured biological assets at cost. Meanwhile, in 2018, after the implementation of PSAK 69, all companies measured biological assets at fair value. Judging from the presentation and disclosure, the company applied PSAK 69 for the first time having reclassified its inventory account to “Biological Asset” and had restated the information regarding any gain or loss resulting from the application of PSAK 69, except for PT Multi Agro Gemilang Plantation Tbk. (MAGP) which did not perform reclassification and did not restate its financial statements because the impact of the application of PSAK 69 was immaterial, so restatement was impractical to do.

Job Training has an effect on Employee Performance. So that the first hypothesis which states that job training can improve employee performance is acceptable. 2.). Employee status do not have a significant effect on employee performance. So the second hypothesis which states that the Employee Status variable affects Employee Performance is not accepted. 3). Partially the Job Training variable has an influence on Employee Performance, but the Employee Status variable does not act as a moderating variable in relation to Job Training on Employee Performance. So that the third hypothesis is not accepted The theoretical implication of this research succeeds in providing an explanation of the consistency of the effect of job training on improving employee performance. So that to improve employee performance, companies need to improve job training programs for their employees. However, the effect of Employee Status on improving Employee Performance is weak and insignificant on Employee Performance. The Employee Status variable cannot act as a moderating variable on the increase/effect of Job Training on Employee Performance. The practical implications are: that the improvement of job training programs needs to be done continuously, by evaluating training programs in accordance with technological developments. As for the status of the core employees for forest fire control, they should be permanent employees of the company, while the reserve unit is still managed by a contract system.","agung setyabudi forester & masters students of management, postgraduate programs, bina darma university, palembang, indonesia. setyagung01@gmail.com muji gunarto management department of economics and business faculty, bina darma university, palembang, indonesia mgunarto@binadarma.ac.id anis marjukah management department of economics faculty widya darma university, klaten, indonesia anismarjukah69@gmail.com",

This development of awareness encourages a management concept to face new changes, one of which is called business sustainability (BS). The COVID-19 pandemic situation is a serious challenge for organizations implementing sustainability. Environmental changes such as the COVID-19 pandemic encourage companies to adapt through their capabilities. The purpose of this study is to fill the literature gap by building a conceptual framework that combines socially responsible operations and socially responsible innovation during the COVID-19 pandemic. Another thing also explores the role of dynamic capabilities for sustainability. Dynamic capabilities are attractive because of their potential to improve organizational performance outcomes, particularly in the COVID-19 pandemic situation. Dynamic capabilities that focus on dynamic managerial capability and dynamic innovation capability in an effort to develop the company's sustainability. Managerial capability and innovation capability are believed to be capabilities that have a dominant role in socially responsible operations and innovation. The results of this study on this concept indicate that organizational capabilities provide an understanding of organizational reconfiguration, to develop resources and capabilities (Eisenhardt & Martin, 2000). Studies in the field of operations management show a strong concern regarding how companies use operating capabilities, dynamic innovation capabilities in sustainability efforts.

664,Dynamic Planning Integrated To Production And  Maintenance In Composites Industry: Application Of Mase,"in the composites industry, each change must take into account lot of parameters before being able to set it up. this requires an important amount of data sharing in a limited time. nonetheless, only a minor part of this data is concretely used by the planners for an almost real-time analysis and optimization within production systems. this paper proposes a multi-agent approach for dynamic planning integrated to production and maintenance. according to the supply chain operations reference model (scor), to focus on the process of transforming products to a finished state to meet projected or actual demand, we will work on the “make” area of supply chain. this paper aims to present the problem of supply chain dynamic planning considering maintenance interventions and using a multi-agent system (mas). the main objective of the system is ensuring collaboration between three different entities, planning, production and maintenance in order to take better decisions. to model the proposed system, we used the multi- agent system engineering (mase) methodology.","supply chain, planning, maintenance, production","In this paper, we presented a model of a Multi-Agent System for a dynamic planning integrated to production and maintenance in the case of composites industries. Indeed, the designed MAS allows structuration of the planning task and enables an instant decision making for an efficient chain. The system modeling was made using MaSe methodology. Our MAS allows communication and negotiation between the agents : production, maintenance, planning and supplying. The next step in this work will be the implementation of agents and proposing optimization models as a decision making tools for production planners. And finally, some tests with real data must be done to validate this architecture.

667,Prediction Of Student’S Performance Using Random Forest  Classifier,"measuring student performance based on both qualitative and quantitative factors is essential because many undergraduate students could not be able to complete their degree in recent pasts. at present, students’ dropout rate in university is gradually increasing and many bright students sometimes just cannot cope with the universities. the first-year result of a student is very important because in the majority of cases this drives the students to be either motivated or demotivated. so, the first-year student performance of a renowned university in bangladesh is investigated in this paper. this research is mainly based on finding the reasons for students’ different types of results and then predicting students’ performance based on those eleven significant factors. for this purpose, a popular supervised machine learning algorithm, random forests (rf) have been used for classifying students’ different levels of results and predicting students’ performances. the input dataset for both training and testing were taken by merging the values obtained from two surveys done on students and experts using fuzzy anfis analysis. the result exhibits that rf can perform the classification of multiple classes based on many distinguishing features with 96.88 percent accuracy. this proposed model can also be applied to predict course-wise students’ performances and its precision can also be greatly improved by adding new factors.",fuzzy anfis,"In this work, we propose a hybrid model for predicting first-year university students’ performance in the final examinations. The fuzzy ANFIS is incorporated with RFC to develop that model. Our experimental results illustrated that our proposed model is proved to be effective and pragmatic for the accurate prediction of students’ progress, as compared to some traditional machine learning algorithms. The accuracy of the prediction of the RF model is 96.88%. It is also found that the students’ effort and creating good notes (factor-11 and factor-1) are the two key factors that have a great impact on students’ success. So, early detection of these factors’ ratings could yield valuable insights for a better educational environment and assistance to students’ performance. In conclusion, we point out that the students’ attributes implemented in our work are not bounded rather more new attributes can be introduced in our database to improve the quality of our model. Not only new attributes but also more experts can be added to get more insight into factor ratings. This proposed model can be applied to analyze the senior students’ performance also. Besides, support vector machine (SVM), deep learning algorithms like Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) can be implemented for comparative analysis. However, more data could be integrated by considering other university students’ conditions, which would be more versatile. In addition, students’ progress can be evaluated subject-wise.","sourav kumar ghosh and farhatul janan department of industrial and production engineering bangladesh university of textiles dhaka 1208, bangladesh sourav@butex.edu.bd & janan_ipe@butex.edu.bd",

According to the findings, 64% of participants had no idea where to purchase organic products. In the case of the consumer initiative, it was discovered that participation from individual awareness were through television, newspapers, social media, blogs, friends, and relatives found insignificant. Second, several variables were created depending on the objectives. First, the effect on their behaviours toward consuming organic food, which infers that organic goods have health advantages, but that these benefits are often exaggerated; in this respect, 50.1 percent of the participants preferred agree and strongly agree. The second goal is focused on expectations for products that sound amazing, with 33.3 percent of the participants; agreeing or strongly agreeing. Finally, it has been discovered that consumers' awareness of organic food and its effect on their behaviours toward purchasing organic food was discovered that 58.8% of the participants agreed or strongly agreed with the buying decisions. Their final goal found based on a number of factors, firstly towards Consumers' health consciousness (43 percent), Secondly, Places of buying preferences are almost online, and thirdly for Satisfaction and Frequency of buying based on performance also found much higher, because people are willing to buy more often organic products based on performance. And after all Organic product may lead to be ascending as sustainable business in present scenario.

697,Productivity Improvement In Textile Industry Using Lean  Manufacturing Practices Of 5S & Single Minute Die,"this research was conducted in a leading textile industry of pakistan. the focus of the research was the reduction of overall changeover time at flatbed printing machine. the machine was facing longer changeover times due to which the overall equipment efficiencies and productivity was affected. therefore, the aim of this study was to reduce changeover time to improve productivity by applying lean manufacturing (lm) technique of single minute exchange of dies (smed). the changeover activities were recorded and analyzed. the time & motion study was conducted and internal & external activities were identified. few potential internal activities converted to external. the remaining internal activities were of optimized by suggesting optimal method. the standardization is suggested for proposed solutions to the bottleneck activities so that the same problem will not occur in the future. it has been observed that the smed implementation along with 5s leads to decrease in changeover times and waste elimination. the changeover time was reduced from 142 minutes to 117 minutes which in turn increased the overall productivity of flatbed printing machine. it can be further minimized by proper training of concerned workers and creating awareness among them about lean environment.","lean manufacturing, textile, changeover","This research has identified and uncovered different perspective of changeovers, internal and external as well as value added and non-value-added activities and their consequences on overall productivity.This study focuses on the critical factor of production system such as changeover and suggest ideas to reduce the time duration of changeover to cope with longer changeover time issue. It also emphasizes on the activities that are related to cause changeover delays. Earlier the changeover time of flatbed printing machine was about 142 minutes but now by applying SMED, an essential lean technique and by solving the confronting problems of the changeover, the time spent in changeover is almost 117 minutes. It means that there is reduction in Changeover time now. This study can be used as an effective tool for any industry if the general procedure is applied and expected confronting problems are considered. Nowadays many businesses whether it be service industry or manufacturing industry, their success is truly based on how in the best way they manage and maintain their time and resources. Therefore, in this modern era, the goal of many research studies is to innovate many of such techniques that could help in optimum utilization of the resources and to manipulate the tasks to be completed in minimum time period. 7. Future Implications Due to smaller span of time, the researchers only focused on time study and somehow method study. There was still space for the analysis of macro motion and micro motion study of workers for various operation. Motion study will lead to less fatigue of workers and operation time will also be optimized.

711,Digital Transformation Of Supply Chains During Crisis:  Covid19,"to optimize the process of decision making, supply chain management proposes a set of methods to coordinate the independent actors. however, the difficulty arises once supply chains are treated by different forms of risks, such as natural disasters, weather conditions, terrorist attacks or even global pandemics. this paper, based on an empirical study of supply chain actors, studies the digital transformation of supply chains during global crises. the results of our study show that it is necessary to adapt the digital transformation of supply chain as a solution to global crisis. in order to deal with this problem, a general analysis is necessary to study the effect of pandemics on the supply chain. thereafter, the appropriate digital systems can be adapted. this paper tries to show new research directions to academics and practitioners in adaption of new digital systems.","digitalization, crisis","Accelerating the digitalization of the supply chain is needed to enable the supply chains during pandemics (Taghipour, 2018). In this case, it is essential to addapt more sophisticated simulation techniques (Currie et al. 2020; Cauhois et al., 2017). The impact of the covid-19 crisis on the supply chain, in particular on production systems, confirms that the 4.0 industry and digital manufacturing can play a critical role for SC resilience and ripple effect control (Ivanov and Dolgui 2019), because during the crisis, companies that adopt this digital industrial management mode, which is part of Industry 4.0, are best positioned during the pandemic crisis, and in the planning of future recovery processes (Dubey et al. 2019; Ivanov and Dolgui 2020; Ivanov and Das 2020). We need to strengthen the resilience of the supply chain including through increased SC viability (Ivanov and Dolgui 2020). Due to the problems encountered during pandemic crises throughout history, especially the Covis-19 crisis, and in today’s computerized world, we must start to develop the supply chain towards 100% digital. Especially with the arrival of the 5G, digitization will become a necessity in the near future. Researchers need to conduct research on the security of digital tools, as well as the connection of company networks and information systems, because we are on a part of the company that contains sensitive information that can be used by a company's competitors to eliminate it. So, the question is: “is the digitalization of the supply chain secure?”.","atour taghipour and mohammed merimi faculty of international business normandy university le havre, france atour.taghipour@univ-lehavre.fr , mohammed.merimi@univ-lehavre.fr",
712,Association Rule Mining For Driving Behaviors And Road  Traffic Accidents In Kuwait,"one of the serious problems in kuwait society is the road traffic accident (rtcs). our research objective is to find unknown association rules between rtas and/or driving behaviors from our questionnaire data. an online questionnaire collected rtas and driving behavior data (n=296). the apriori algorithm found 1,733 rules, and each association rule was scrutinized. if pedestrians-involved traffic accidents occur, the probability of no experience in driving school was 2.98 times higher. if drivers had impaired vision problems (e.g., myopia), the probability of a pedestrians-involved accident was 2.04 times higher. these findings may indicate the importance of driving school experience and visual acuity test at driving license issuance in kuwait.","driving patterns, 2019","We used the Apriori algorithm to find the association rules between a road traffic accident and Kuwait's driving behaviors. We discovered that pedestrian-related accidents were related to a lack of driving school experience. Pedestrian-related accidents were also associated with the myopia problem in Kuwait. Eleven percent of myopia people did not wear glasses while driving, while all hyperopia and astigmatism people reported wearing glasses. This information may be helpful for the law-enforcement agency and the government reduces road traffic accidents in Kuwait.

713,On The Dependency Of Material Flows On Quality And The  Configuration Of The Inspection System,"the flow of materials is a major constituent of in-plant logistics and the material handling system is a key factor in the performance of production/manufacturing system. similar factors govern resource requirements and material flows. in particular, quality factors and the configuration of the quality assurance – the inspections' system. nonetheless, only recently has the association between material flows, quality levels and the configuration of the inspections' system been noticed. consequently, the dependencies of material flows on quality levels and the configuration of the inspections' system can be examined. the quality levels, the configuration of the inspections' system, and inspection error rates significantly affect the volumes of material flows. in addition, the configuration of the inspections' system affects the structure of the material flow network by adding nodes – inspection stations, to it and changing the flow paths, accordingly. these effects are demonstrated, examined and discussed in this talk.","material flow, material handling, quality, inspection errors",,"moshe eben-chaime department of industrial engineering & management ben gurion university of the negev be'er sheva, israel even@bgu.ac.il",
714,Quality Assurance In Engineering Education: Accreditation  And Its Global Influence,"historically the quality of engineering education has been controlled by the institution itself and monitored by the national level government organizations. as engineering has become a more global profession, issues of quality assurance and competitiveness of engineering education were being intensifying continually. with the effect of globalization 3.0 (2000-present), the concern of quality assurance and competitiveness of engineering education has been amplified further. in general, as education has been impacted by globalization, schools and education systems now are competing on a global arena rather than just local or national competition. accreditation board for engineering and technology (abet), founded in 1932 as an engineering professional body, dedicated to the education, accreditation, regulation and professional development of engineering professionals and students in the united states. however, the less developed countries were facing difficulties to maintain quality of engineering education as required in the global market. as a consequence, developed countries do not find a smooth supply of competent engineers. with this realization, the international engineering alliance (iea), a global not-for-profit organisation, seeks to improve engineering education and competence globally. it fulfils this mission through its constituents: education agreements that are concerned with standards, best practice accreditation processes and mutual recognition of accredited engineering programmes and agreements for defining and recognising professional competence. an explicit outcome of iea is the washington accord originally signed in 1989. this accord is an international accreditation agreement for tertiary-level engineering qualifications between the bodies responsible for accreditation in its signatory countries and regions. with this, the accreditation had become increasingly prescriptive and a powerful tool for quality assurance. it is a “quality stamp” which ensures that an accredited programme has undergone a rigorous process of external peer evaluation based on predefined standards and complies with the minimum requirements. this paper focuses on the outcomes of accreditation to enhance excellence in engineering education. previous studies in various national contexts are reviewed and the question of whether accreditation can really uphold a sustainable engineering education is answered.","accreditation, higher education, quality assurance, march 7-11","In this paper the quality assurance systems and accreditation of engineering programme have been discussed. The central view of this paper is how the engineers can successfully work in global environment beyond the national boundary. It also briefly discussed the basic requirement of engineering accreditation under Washington Accord and its benefits. This paper showed the followings. 1. Great opportunity for import/export of human resources with engineering background. Engineers can communicate and performs engineering activities in a team beyond the national boundaries. 2. Great opportunity for third world country to provide engineering education at least with minimum fulfilment of Washington Accord requirement. 3. Washington Accord is an outcome based education with specific outcomes that are basically common with other signatories. 4. In general, Washington Accord has open the door of globalization in the field of engineering and mentoring the signatories. 5. It has specified everything for accreditation which is consider a very good guideline but too much specification also leads to poor uniqueness.","mohammad yeakub ali1, seri rahayu ya’akub2 and ramesh singh3 mechanical engineering programme area, faculty of engineering, universiti teknologi brunei tungku highway, gadong be1410, brunei darussalam 1yeakub.ali@utb.edu.bn, 2serirahayu.yaakub@utb.edu.bn, 3ramesh.singh@utb.edu.bn muataz hazza f. al hazza mechanical and industrial engineering department school of engineering, american university of ras al khaimah po box 10021, united arab emirates muataz.alhazza@aurak.ac.ae erry y. t. adesta department of manufacturing and materials engineering, faculty of engineering, international islamic university malaysia, p.o. box 10, 50728 kuala lumpur, malaysia eadesta@iium.edu.my",

720,A Multi-Objective Optimization Model For An Algal Biofuel  Supply Chain Integrating Resource Recirculation,"demand for energy is only expected to grow in the near future due to global population growth which result to a rise in environmental concerns with the diminishing supply of fossil fuels along with the rise of greenhouse gas emissions. biofuel production from microalgae biomass has been proven to be a viable alternative for fossil fuels; however, challenges are faced regarding its economic sustainability. the integration of processes to yield various high-value bioproducts have been implemented to raise profitability and sustainability. incorporating a circular economy outlook, recirculation of resource flows is maximized to satisfy economic and environmental sustainability through waste minimization. previous modelling studies have not looked into the opportunity of integrating continuous recirculation and reuse of resources. in this work, a novel multi-objective optimization model is developed centered on an algal biofuel supply chain that simultaneously optimizes cost and environmental impact, integrates inputs and processes aimed towards a closed loop process flow, and adopts the principle of resource recovery and recirculation. a case study is solved as proof of concept and to illustrate the design methodology, optimal solutions based on economic and environmental performance are analyzed. scenario analysis is also performed to analyze system behavior under varying conditions.","algal biofuels, supply chain","and Recommendation This study introduced a multi-objective optimization model for an algal biofuel supply chain incorporating resource recirculation aiming to maximize profit and minimize environmental impact. Having optimized the two objectives separately, displayed the tradeoffs that occur between the environmental and economic objectives. When profit is maximized, conflict is evident as the environmental impact increases. With the implementation of impact minimization, yields a net loss for the biofuel supply chain given that less revenue is generated due to lowered biofuel production. The consideration of both objectives in a multi-objective optimization model strikes a balance between the two objectives. Future work may look into the incorporation of different methodologies to properly estimate the environmental impacts such as Life Cycle Analysis. Moreover, the incorporation of uncertain parameters into the optimization model such as demand, recovery rates, and process unit product yield is a possible extension for this research. Another extension to this research is looking into the effects of resource recirculation on the product quality of the supply chain through the constant reuse of material. Lastly, the use of real-life data for the estimation of parameters in the model would likely yield more appropriate results to be applied in real-world industry applications.","celine marie a. solis, jayne lois g. san juan, and dennis e. cruz industrial engineering department de la salle university 2401 taft avenue, manila, philippines celine_solis@dlsu.edu.ph, jayne.sanjuan@dlsu.edu.ph, dennis.cruz@dlsu.edu.ph",
721,Food Waste Management Of Restaurants In Kwazulu-Natal  South Africa,"food waste is one of the major concerns for environmental and socio-economic sustainability in both developed and developing countries. the extent and complexity of the global food waste problem has brought it to the forefront of environmental agenda. in particular, food wastage is of critical importance for the hospitality sector, whose operations generate excessive food waste. this sector is one with significant potential for food waste prevention. this study examines the nature and extent of food waste in a restaurant in south africa. the study further investigates measures undertaken to monitor and manage food waste, and barriers facing food waste management in a restaurant. thirty restaurants participated in this study and the data was collected through an online survey questionnaire that was emailed to restaurant managers for completion. the results indicate that whilst restaurants are engaging in some forms of food waste management practices, they are faced with a number of challenges. the main challenge preventing effective food waste management practices is the lack of awareness on the importance of monitoring food wastage. better technology is a possibility to reduce the time to monitor and measure food waste. using food waste as a form of environmental benefit needs consideration.","food waste, restaurants, barriers, management",,"saijal sucheran department of industrial engineering durban university of technology durban, south africa saijalsucheran@gmail.com oludolapo a. olanrewaju department of industrial engineering durban university of technology durban, south africa oludolapoo@dut.ac.za","References

722,Optimal Restoration Of Community Structures For  Enhancing Interdependent Infrastructure Network,"community structures exist in different infrastructure networks such as water, gas, and power networks, among others, where each network is split into multiple sets of components. such sets are sparsely connected but have densely connected components within each one of them. such community structures are formed in infrastructure networks based on physical connections within each network or their spatial characteristics, among others. however, infrastructure networks depend on one another for their proper functionality. though the interdependencies across infrastructure networks can improve their efficiency, they make them highly vulnerable to any disruption. in this work, we address the interdependent network restoration problem from community structures restoration perspective. that is, how to restore community structures in a set of infrastructure networks that are physically interdependent following a disruption. accordingly, we propose an optimization model using mixed-integer programming aiming to enhance the resilience of the system of interdependent infrastructure networks. the model provides a set of restoration tasks for each infrastructure network, according to their influence on the performance of their respected networks, and allocates and schedules the selected restoration tasks to the available work crews. the proposed model is demonstrated with a system of interdependent infrastructure networks considering different disruption scenarios.","resilience, restoration","In this work, we study the INRP from community structures restoration perspective. Accordingly, we propose a restoration model using MIP to restore community structures in a set of infrastructure networks that are physically interdependent following a disruption. The objective of the model is to enhance the resilience of the system of interdependent networks considering the availability of time and infrastructure-specific resources. The model provides a set of restoration tasks for each infrastructure network, according to their influence on the performance of their respected networks, and allocates and schedules the selected restoration tasks to the available work crews. Multiple factors could affect the trajectory of resilience enhancement for the system of interdependent networks: (i) the disruption size (i.e., number of disrupted network components), (ii) nature of the interdependencies among networks, (iii) recovery durations of disrupted components, and (iv) availability of work crews for each network. In addition, available time and budget could also limit the restoration process. The proposed model could be extended to consider: (i) other interdependencies among infrastructure networks (e.g., geographical interdependency), (ii) location of work crews, (iii) accessibility of the roads, (iv) parameters uncertainty, and (v) cascading disruptions. Finally, community structures could be identified using different algorithms based on different perspectives, i.e., other than Fast Modularity algorithm.

726,Life Cycle Assessment Of Ordinary Portland Cement (Opc)  Using Damage Oriented (Endpoint) Approach.,"the cement industry's environmental impact is fast becoming a significant concern with a continuous increase in population. different studies were carried out to understand this impact and potential damage, but more concrete results are required. this study aims to verify the damage caused by a cement industry to areas of significance to life (aosl). the tool used for this evaluation is the life cycle assessment (lca) of ordinary portland cement (opc). the evaluation outcome showed that the clinker production phase has the most significant damage to both human health and the ecosystem because of high co2 emissions. the resources prone to scarcity are natural gas, coal, clay, and most importantly, petroleum. with this evaluation, the life expectancy of individuals, the species loss, and economic value loss resulting from extraction because of damage caused by environmental impacts from the cement industry can be calculated annually in every country.","clinker production, damage, lca","This evaluation was carried out on 1kg of ordinary Portland cement. The endpoint approach applied in this study presents 22 different environmental impact categories classified into three damage categories of AoSL. Clinker production contributes 70.1% to HH and 77.8% to ES, affecting humans and species' health because of the amount of CO2 emitted at this production stage. In both damage categories, 67.3% and 79.9% CO2 were emitted, respectively. This is in line with what is in literature but now with an exact percentage. CO2 emission causes global warming which brings about climate change that affects both humans and the ecosystem. In the two damage categories, other primary emissions such as NO2, SO2, CH4, particulate matter were emitted into air and water though minimal compared to CO2 gas. Using RS such as natural gas, coal, clay, and petroleum in OPC production can lead to scarcity, especially petroleum (crude oil). Therefore, this study concludes that the clinker production pro cess emits the highest CO2 gas and, thus, the most hazardous production stage to both human health and the ecosyste m. On average, about 0.74kg of CO2 gas was obtained for every 1kg of OPC produced. It also concludes that cement' s continuous production can lead to the scarcity of resources such as petroleum, natural gas, coal, and clay. As seen above, ReCiPe makes use of DALY, Species/yr, and USD2013 as units of HH, ES, and RS damage categories, respectively. Disability-adjusted life years (DALY) have to do with the years of life spent or years of life damaged because of environmental impacts. Hence, with this evaluation, we can easily determine the years of damage to people's lives in an entire based on the production output of such a country. Furthermore, the evaluation has shown that whatever affects species affects human beings seeing that almost all the primary emissions affecting human health jeopardize the ecosystem. Also, humans feed on some of them and are also part of their environment. Species/yr denotes the species lost within a specific period (the year in this case) to water bodies and the environment as a whole; this can also be evaluated for a nation per year. Also, damage to resources is based on the monetary value of economic loss due to the increase in costs because of extraction.

The results obtained demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of MPA and TSA to competitively solve the ED problem in comparison with other methods in the literature. The convergence curves of the proposed methods also highlight their fast convergence capabilities when applied to the two test systems. Furthermore, the promising results obtained in this study is an indication of the potential of using the MPA and TSA to solve even more complex optimization problems.","oluwafemi ajayi, reolyn heymann and ewaoche john okampo centre for collaborative digital networks department of electrical and electronic engineering science, university of johannesburg, south africa.",

732,Product Defects Analysis Using Six Sigma Method – A Case  Study At Rice Milling Company,"the industrial field requires the company to improve product quality to meet customer satisfaction. the performance of the company affects customers as the key decision-makers to define the quality of products or services. as a food provider, rice milling company has a big role in maintaining its performance to supply rice. rice milling company needs to have a good quality of products and services by enhancing the management of quality, one way is by reducing the number of defective products. this research aims to perceive the most causes to eliminate defect causes through continuous product improvement. the data collection was conducted at company x as a rice milling which uses the six sigma method to calculate the data and its solutions are performed using microsoft excel. thus, it was obtained that the quality of rice is quite good with the sigma level is 2.368 and defect rate of 192,672 million productions (dpmo), also the process capability is 0.246. there are four types of defects which are bugs, groats, immature rice, unknown object. the main contributor of defect is groats with 38.6% of total production. as a result, it needs to be fixed to improve the production quality.","six sigma, dpmo, microsoft excel, process capability","and Suggestions Based on the research conducted, we could conclude that: 1. The probability of defect is 192,672 kilograms of rice for one year, which means that in one million opportunities there will be 192,672 chances that the production process will produce defect products. 2. The sigma level is 2.368, which is above the industrial average level in Indonesia, but still need improvement to reach zero defect. 3. The capability process of the Company X is 0.246 which means that company need some improvements to eliminate the uncontrolled processes. 4. The largest contributor of the defect is groats with 38.6% of total production, then followed by immature rice with 29.8%, bug with 29.0%, and the last is unknown object with 2.6%. 5. There are four causes of defect, which are man, method, materials, machine, and environment that should take into consideration in order to reduce product defect and approach zero defect. Several suggestions could be done for further research as follows: 1. Further researcher could conduct the observation with the longer period to get an accurate number of total production and defects. 2. For further research it could be done using another tool in order to have a deeper analyzing of the data collected.","indah chyntia bella rosa, tiara risa damayanti, ade lita kusumaningrum, and sri susilawati islam industrial engineering study program sampoerna university jakarta, indonesia indah.rosa@my.sampoernauniversity.ac.id; tiara.damayanti@my.sampoernauniversity.ac.id; ade.kusumaningrum@my.sampoernauniversity.ac.id; sri.islam@sampoernauniversity.ac.id",
733,The Role Of Economic Growth And Information Technology In  Military Development,"a number of study show that the relationship between economic growth, information technology, and military development is ambiguous. some countries with good economic growth reduce their military budget. however, some more developed countries even increase their military budget. in addition, some less developed countries yet promote their military development. this study aims to examine the relationship between economic growth and information techology, such as internet and mobile phone subscription, with military development. the data used came from the world development data of the world bank covering 260 countries in the world and employing panel data regression using the fixed effects model. the dependent variable is the military expenditure (current usd) and the independent variables are gdp (current us$) and the number of mobile cellular subscriptions. the results of the study show that gdp and mobile cellular subscriptions have positive and significant associations with military expenditure. an increase of one us dollar in gdp is associated with an increase of us$ 0.0109002 in military expenditure (current usd). meanwhile, an increase of one unit of mobile cellular subscription is related with an increase of us$ 38.28941 in military expenditure.","economic growth, regression","Military spending can be influenced by several factors. The results from the panel data of 82 countries during 2009–2017 in this study show that time, GDP, and the number of fixed broadband and mobile cellular subscriptions are all positively associated with military spending significantly and statistically. However, further studies to find the total factor productivity to develop a nation and to improve human welfare should be carried out.

734,Evaluation Of Window Parameters Of Noncontrast Cranial  Ct Brain Images For Hyperacute And Acute Ischemic Stroke,"most of the recent study about deep learning in medical images have revolved the ability of deep learning models to interpretation of diagnostic result and anatomical recognition. however, deep learning can also be used to enhance a wide range of non-interpretive issues such as image enhancement that relevant to radiologists and patients. for ischemic stroke, a noncontrast cranial computer tomography (ncct) is imaging technique used for diagnosis. the cerebral infarction in early stage on ncct is difficult to notice because of limitation of image. normally, the patients need to do a computer tomography perfusion (ctp) for identification the damage, but it takes time while the proceedings of the 11th annual international conference on industrial engineering and operations management singapore, march 7-11, 2021 © ieom society international 179",,"In this work, we presented and evaluated the window parameters, window level and window width for hyperacute and acute ischemic stroke classification on NCCT images without CTp by using deep learning. The dataset contains two classes of brain that is normal or lesion (ischemic stroke). The NCCT image pixel is 12 bit or 4,096 level of the intensity which contain the different composition in image, thus we performed contrast enhancement by determining the suitable windowing parameters (WL, WW) from our 14 predefined windows via 5-fold cross validation. Every training data need to prepare by skull-strapping and image augmentation in 54 ways of affine transformations i.e. flipping, rotation, and translation. We applied transfer learning from brain hemorrhage stroke classification model that it used the Inception V3 engine and transferred that weights to initialize our model and adding some convolutional layers to meet our condition. The result of proposed window parameter and classification model achieved a good performance with NCCT images of hyperacute and acute stroke. We found that the model can well predict with window level at 35 and window width at 95, it gets the area of under curve at 90.84% and average accuracy of 82.20% For the limitation of this approach, it needs to be adjusted the window level and window with by manual for finding the highest accuracy. However, we can take benefit of this image enhancement to support the image segmentation in the preprocessing part which can be extended in the future.

736,Observations On New Initial Basic Feasible Solution (Ibfs)  Methods Published In The Literature For Transportation,"the time required to reach the optimal solution for transportation problem (tp) is primarily dependent on the quality of the ibfs method. therefore, many researchers are involved in developing a new ibfs method for tp. another reason for proposing new ibfs methods is that most of the organizations are expecting better solution than the best solution in comparing with the type of expertise and technology required for obtaining the best solution. based on our detailed analysis of the literature, it is observed that there are 105 ibfs methods are presented in the literature. though many ibfs methods are reported, to the best of our knowledge, no study systematically reviewed all the reported ibfs methods in the literature. so, this study addressed this gap. from the detailed analyses of the literature it is observed that (a) except a very few studies, all the reported studies in the literature did not follow the required research processes to claim that the proposed method(s) is(are) performing better/superior to the benchmark procedure(s) considered in their respective study, (b) almost all the researchers considered the vam as benchmark procedure but not the latest better performing ibfs method(a) reported in the literature; (c) a few sets of authors proposed different ibfs methods and published in different journals, but they never compared their own proposed methods together; and (d) though there are 143 different tiny size transportation problems reported during 1965 to 2020 in the literature for performance analysis, all most all the research studies considered only a very small number of tiny tp instances out of these 143 instances, which are favoring their proposed method(s), for their performance analysis. these observations are substantiated by solving all the 143 tiny tps, identified in the literature, considering a set of latest ibfs methods published in the literature.","problem instances, march 7-11",,"problem m. mathirajan department of management studies, indian institute of science, bangalore-560012 msdmathi@iisc.ac.in m. vimala rani vinod gupta school of management, indian institute of technology, kharagpur-721302 vimala@vgsom.iitkgp.ac.in","References

737,Critical Factors Of Supplier Selection In The Food  And Beverage Industry Of Saudi Arabia: A Fuzzy-,"to ensure business sustainability, businesses seek reliable suppliers that can meet their customer's expectations. selecting reliable suppliers can be a winning strategy providing a competitive advantage in the market over competitors. therefore, unlike many other operational functions, supplier selection is regarded as a strategic function within companies. however, when evaluating and selecting suppliers, procurement departments must build their selection process based on certain factors that they deem most important to their business activities. the food and beverage industry are not an exception to this scenario. the purpose of this study is to reveal the set of the most critical factors of supplier selection in the food and beverage industry of saudi arabia. a designed survey was conducted to collect information about factors that play a major role in supplier selection from the perspective of decision-makers, supply chain professionals, and procurement officers in the food and beverage manufacturing companies of saudi arabia . subsequently, the fuzzy technique of order preference by similarity to the ideal solution (fuzzy-topsis) approach was used to rank the factors based on their importance. the findings of the study revealed a ranked set of 35 critical factors influencing supplier selection. the top five critical factors are speed, demand capability, customer service, communication system, and responsiveness. implications of this study include assisting the food and beverage industry of saudi arabia for a better supplier selection using the revealed set of ranked critical factors as selection criteria.","critical factors, supplier selection, fuzzy-topsis","To sum up, the obtained results are generally concerned with three main issues i.e., time, service, and capability. Hence, the top five factors ranked in Table 4. This crystallizes the challenges being faced on food and beverage companies in Saudi Arabia while evaluating and selecting between suppliers. In addition, the strictly reflects the nature of the food and beverage industry in Saudi market. (Marshall 1997) classified supply chain strategies into two categories, low-cost strategy, and responsive strategy. Hence, the respondents have shown that the strategy that is suitable to be incorporated in Saudi, as the highlighted criteria are concerned with speed, demand, capability, and responsiveness. Additionally, many companies have multiple items sourced from multiple suppliers, thus, constructing multiple models for these multiple items. If this case occurs, other alternative approaches should be considered e.g., Goal Programming. Finally, the Implications of this study aims in revealing the most critical factors and assisting the food and beverage industry of Saudi Arabia for a better supplier selection process using the revealed set of ranked critical factors. 6.

739,A Review Of Green Marketing Strategy Literature: Minireview Approach,"green marketing is one of the strategic efforts to create a business based on environment and health, has been known in the late 1980s and early 1990s. there are many terms regarding green marketing, including environmental marketing, ecological marketing, sustainable marketing, green marketing and societal marketing. green marketing develops in line with the public's attention to environmental issues so that society demands responsibility from business people in carrying out business activities. this paper seeks to provide literature on green marketing or sustainable marketing. reviews of green marketing are carried out by reading and analysing 34 review journal articles and summarised in two tables, namely journal articles and publisher distribution and article categorisation based on their subject. the problem faced in this study is that companies must understand that when entering the market, it does not cause confusion in consumers' minds and does not violate regulations. there is a mismatch of market perceptions with consumer perceptions, the existence of uncertain market competitive pressures, even though the government has enacted laws to allow consumers to make better decisions and motivate consumers to be environmentally friendly. there is always difficulty in determining policies that cover all environments. and lastly is the lack of consumer knowledge about environmental issues, causing companies to represent products or services in a market where consumers do not believe that the product or services being promoted is environmentally friendly. in conclusion, this study finds a significant effect of green marketing on its brand image, impacting consumer purchasing decision behaviour.",green marketing,,"ryan firdiansyah, monizaihasra mohamed, mohd yusoff yusliza, jumadil saputra and zikri muhammad faculty of business, economics and social development universiti malaysia terengganu 21030 kuala nerus, terengganu, malaysia ryan.firdiansyah.1979@gmail.com, monizamohamed@umt.edu.my, yusliza@umt.edu.my, jumadil.saputra@umt.edu.my, zikri@umt.edu.my abdul talib bon department of production and operations universiti tun hussein onn malaysia 86400 parit raja, johor, malaysia talibon@gmail.com",
740,A Sequential Heuristic For Production-Inventory Planning  And Supplier Selection Based On Quantity Discounts In A,"this paper addresses an integrated new problem of production-inventory planning and supplier selection based on quantity discounts in a closed loop supply chain (clsc) environment where backorders are allowed. the process of remanufacturing, specifically the problem of recovery of components from the acquired used products and remanufacturing of the components as-good-as new is considered. an existing mathematical model has been considered and modified in line with the current problem. since the proposed mathematical model is computationally intractable for solving large scale real-life sized problem, a sequential heuristic method is proposed and the same is seen to provide near optimal solution for small scale problem instances. furthermore, though the prime objective of the study is maximizing profit, the heuristic is designed in a way that encourages deriving maximum benefit from acquired used products even though it might result in compromising on total profit. this is in line with the motto of clsc to reduce dependency and use of virgin raw materials and also reduce disposal in landfills.","production planning, remanufacturing, supplier selection","and future scope A production planning-inventory management problem of CLSC is addressed related to a component remanufacturing environment considering backordering and quantity discounts. Particularly, the present study considers multiple products, multiple components, multiple raw materials, multiple planning periods, multiple suppliers, and multiple discount intervals. As the problem is computationally intractable to get optimal solution, a SHA has been proposed. The performance evaluation of the SHA is observed over 9 randomly generated small scale problem instances in comparison with a mathematical model available in the literature. Using the RPD as a performance metric, we conclude that the proposed heuristic gives near optimal solution as compared to the mathematical model. Future research can look into relaxing certain assumptions of the present study and comparing the performance of the proposed heuristic with the ILP model. Development or application of efficient metaheuristics could also be addressed. As the current study only considers RPD as the performance metric, future studies can compare the heuristic and ILP model using various other performance metrics.

741,Another Empirical Application Of The Similarity  Confirmation Method In Evaluating The Madm Methods,"a ‘similarity confirmation method’ (scm) was recently proposed for comparing the final results obtained using different multi-attribute decision-making (madm) models. in a 2018 study entitled ‘rank-based comparative research flow benchmarking the effectiveness of ahp-gtma on aiding decisions of shredder selection by reference to ahp-topsis’, the rank order vectors (rovs) obtained using ahp-gtma and ahp-topsis are treated as two statistical samples. so, the supporting evidence that ‘the two samples are not (drawn) from non-identical populations’ was found to further justify the similarity observed between them using traditional measures (e.g., difference, absolute distance and euclidean distance), and this ‘intangible statistics measure’ used the mann-whitney u test. this thought- provoking concept inspired the proposal of the systematic scm in 2019 (see the paper: ‘the effectiveness of if- madm for group decisions: methods and an empirical assessment for the selection of a senior centre’). in the scm, another common k-s (kolmogorov-smirnov) test in data analytics was applied to show further evidence that ‘the two samples are not (drawn) from non-identical distributions’. this provided more evidence regarding the similarity present between the results. in addition, the scm allows more methods to be compared in a pair-wise manner. this property was applied to support the efficacy of the intuitionistic-fuzzy (if-)madm method because of the similarities rendered in the results between if-madm and other widely applied ‘credible’ methods (i.e., ahp and topsis). this study presents another empirical application of the scm using real decision data sourced from an earlier 2017 study entitled ‘modelling the decision of paper shredder selection using analytic hierarchy process and graph theory and matrix approach’, in which ahp-gtma, another relatively new method, was used for aiding the product-selection decisions for bulk purchase. the scm is applied to the same data, and together with the use of ahp-topsis, the ahp-saw (i.e., ahp with simple-additive weighting at the second stage) is also introduced for comparison. after rounds of scm experiments, the observed similarity between each pair of rovs is confirmed because there is little evidence to support the claim that any pair of these three methods are not similar in terms of their results, as the p values of the non-parametric tests are high (=1 or ~1). this not only cross-validates the methods (i.e., the results are all very similar using these methods; this is key for using these madm models in practice) but also reconfirms that the ahp-gtma model is effective, too, by using the systematic scm. however, as ahp-gtma yields a result more similar (in fact, almost identical) to that of ahp-saw than to that of ahp-topsis, it is worthwhile to obtain more knowledge by investigating the score vectors that are behind the rovs (and that have determined these rovs, e.g., the relative closeness index in topsis) and/or to utilise other credible madm methods, the already-verified if- madm or even the outranking ones. all this can be done by using the scm in the future, and the results can further be compared with those produced using other measures, e.g., the ‘value of similarity’ (ws) coefficient.",march 7-11,,"for a type-selection decision case before bulk purchase zheng-yun zhuang department of civil engineering national kaohsiung university of science and technology sanmin district, kaohsiung, 807, taiwan (roc) wayne@nkust.edu.tw, waynemcgwire@yahoo.com shu-chin chang department of accounting chung yuan christian university zhongli district, taoyuan city, 320, taiwan (roc) schang@cycu.edu.tw",
742,Influence Of Substrate Temperatures On Morphological Tio2  Nano-Layers Properties,"this paper presents the elaboration of titanium dioxide tio2 nano-layers for different temperatures. the nano-layers are deposited by radio frequency (rf) magnetron sputtering technique. in this work the analyzed of temperature effect on the optical and surface condition properties are investigated using scanning electron microscopy (sem), energy- dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (eds), atomic force microscopy (afm) and uv–visible spectroscopy. the tio2 nano-layers surface roughness range from 1.04 nm to 1.6 nm for 450°c and 300°c, respectively. uv–visible spectrophotometry characterization of the deposited tio2 nano-layers show that the films gap varies according to the temperature variation with 3,6ev for t=300 and 3.8ev for t=450°c. we can deduce that the optical gap varies proportionally with the temperature variation. otherwise, the eds results imply the formation of tio2.","semiconductor, tio2 nano-films, afm, sem","In this paper, the growth of the titanium nano-layers using a ceramic Ti target was presented. This study aims to examine TiO2 nano-films morphology for two temperature. Surface morphology was characterized. Following AFM characterization results, it is found that a smoothest surface is observed for T=450°C. In addition, we can note the coexistence of Ti and O in the same place (k) from the microanalysis EDS. This, gives evidence of the formation of the stoichiometric compound, and reveal that the films are oxygen excess. However, optical measurements indicate that the gap decreases with increasing temperature in visible and infrared spectral range. For the rest of this work, we plan to study the variation of the deposited nano-layers thickness and the elaboration conditions such as: the pressure, the sputtering and reactive gases flux on the morphological, optical and electrical TiO2 Nano-layers characteristics.

China, which was not only a competitor, was awarded the project due to the availability of low-interest loans; on the other hand, Japan, which had expressed interest in the project, had proposed that the project be financed by the Indonesian government. Surprisingly, Japan was the first to have indicated interested in the project and had even gone ahead to commence working on a feasibility study for HSR track, connecting Jakarta to the country’s second largest city, Surabaya, which is about 730 kilometers apart.","aleksander purba department of civil engineering, faculty of engineering university of lampung, bandar lampung 35145 indonesia aleksander.purba@eng.unila.ac.id john tampil purba department of management faculty of economics and business universitas pelita harapan, tangerang-15811, indonesia john.purba@uph.edu sidik budiono department of management faculty of economics and business universitas pelita harapan, tangerang-15811, indonesia sidik.budiono@uph.edu",
746,Fighting Poverty Gap Through Literacy And Electricity:  A Case From Indonesia,"literacy is crucial because it is a gateway for information, knowledge, and technological mastery. literacy can be a deciding factor in someone working to find a better income. so, electricity is a basic requirement for at least household lighting. but with the development of technology making electricity can be used for various kinds of equipment. poverty becomes a very complex problem that has broad impacts. poverty destroys purchasing power, decreases human quality, and decreases economic welfare. therefore, this paper wants to test how literacy and electricity can fight poverty. the econometrics model in this study is the effect of literacy and electricity on poverty in the indonesian territory. this study uses secondary data cross section as many as 501 districts and cities in indonesia. the analytical method in this study is robust least squared model. the results of the analysis of this study conclude that an increase in literacy and electricity can significantly reduce poverty. every 1% increase in literacy will reduce the poverty gap index by 0.066, then every 1% increase in household access to electricity will reduce the poverty gap index by 0.052. this study suggests that the policy of literacy program and fulfilling electricity is crucial to combating poverty in all regions in indonesia.","literacy, electricity","Based on the results of these discussions, the government still must implement poverty alleviation programs with strategies that are tailored to the conditions of each region in Indonesia. Poverty alleviation programs play a major role outside of the model I propose. Thus, the variables selected in the poverty alleviation model and program synergize each other to reduce the poverty gap index. The combination of policies on literacy and meeting electricity needs together is the key to alleviating poverty. With everyone ‘s reading and writing skills, they can work individually or in groups. The ability of people to be able to read and write will enable these individuals to pursue prosperity and at the same time get out of poverty. However, electricity is a basic component for all activities in every social and economic sector. Currently, the Indonesian government is trying to meet electricity needs by building power plants, especially on large and densely populated islands. Electricity in households has played a very powerful role in alleviating poverty. The availability of sufficient and distributed electricity throughout Indonesia makes the economy more efficient, improves the environmental conditions of activities and further reduces the poverty gap index.","sidik budiono department of management faculty of economics and business universitas pelita harapan, tangerang-15811, indonesia sidik.budiono@uph.edu john tampil purba department of management faculty of economics and business universitas pelita harapan, tangerang-15811, indonesia john.purba@uph.edu aleksander purba civil engineering department, faculty of engineering universitas lampung-bandar lampung 35145, indonesia aleksander.purba@eng.unila.ac.id",
747,Robust Least Square Model: Increasing Literacy Through  Sanitation And Electricity In Indonesia,"good sanitation is not only the basis for creating a healthy environment for human resources, but also good sanitation will support and make a learning atmosphere for illiterate people become literate. so, electricity is a basic requirement for at least household lighting. but with the development of technology making electricity can be used for various kinds of equipment. sufficient electricity in households also supports the atmosphere when people learn to pursue literacy. literacy is a crucial because it is a gateway for information, knowledge, and technological mastery. literacy can be a key factor in someone working to find a good income. therefore, literacy will not only increase purchasing power (income) but also individual welfare. this study wants to reveal how crucial the availability of sanitation water and electricity are in increasing literacy in every district and city in indonesia surveyed. this study uses cross section data with 501 districts and cities throughout indonesia. the test results prove that the presence of sanitation water and electricity significantly influences literacy. the results of this study also suggest increasing access to sanitation water intensively and electricity to increase literacy.","literacy, sanitation, electricity","Based on the description in the discussion and findings above, the availability of sanitation water and electricity has a positive effect on literacy in 501 districts and cities spread throughout Indonesia. The existence of water in daily life activities has a very crucial role in all corners of Indonesia. So far, sanitation water is provided and managed by local government companies at low prices so that all households can access it. Result of research proved that sanitation improves mental health of individuals, so that better mental health increase literacy rate. This case in Indonesia, water is not only a basic need but also has a powerful function to support literacy in every region in Indonesia. The value and benefits of water are not only powerful for literacy program but also have a very large multiplier effect, so sanitation water is a key component for people's life. The results of this study prove that electricity improves literacy. The availability of electricity makes lighting in the house every day. Thus, people tend to be eager to learn and especially basic learning. Through this process, the literacy rate is increased than before electricity. Until 2020, due to several geographical and scattered factors, regional remoteness, poverty, and culture. It is difficult for the government to reduce the number of illiterate people to below 3.2 percent of the population. Therefore, we propose this model to support literacy programs in Indonesian territory. With this econometric model, we hope to form an enabling circumstance through sanitation and electricity.","sidik budiono department of management faculty of economics and business universitas pelita harapan, tangerang-15811, indonesia sidik.budiono@uph.edu john tampil purba department of management faculty of economics and business universitas pelita harapan, tangerang-15811, indonesia john.purba@uph.edu wilson rajagukguk faculty of economics and business, universitas kristen indonesia jl. mayjen sutojo no.2, cawang, jakarta 13630, indonesia wrajagukguk@yahoo.com; wilson.rajagukguk@uki.ac.id",

751,"Asdp Ship Conversion Into Suramadu River Cruise  Agum Setyo Bintoro1, Refiantika Rachma Utami1, Suci Amalia Putri1","the existence of the suramadu (surabaya madura) bridge connecting java island and madura island has a huge impact on the crossing ferry sector of port of ujung surabaya to port of kamal madura. the decreasing of users in the crossing service has to result in the unused vessels that have been operating on this crossing route. abolishing toll road fee in suramadu bridge in 2018 resulted in a huge decreasing number of crossing service passengers in 2008 to 2009 reached 2.9 million passengers which caused the management of asdp to lose 15 billion rupiah per-year in average due to large operational costs and lack of passengers. on another hand, the trend of tourist visits to surabaya continued to increase with an average increase of 4% from 2010 to 2015 making the surabaya city government continue to look for ways to develop tourism in surabaya. the utilization of asdp ships originally used to serve the crossing can be converted into suramadu tourist ships to develop the tourism attractions in surabaya. the conversion of the ship can also help in overcoming the losses sustained by the asdp.","ship conversion, tourism ship, benefit cost ratio","In the BCR analysis, it is known that there are advantages in operating a tour boat in the form of tangiable and intangiable benefits. The tangiable benefits are in the form of increased income and increased profitability due to the operation of tour boats. In the operation of the tourist boat, income is obtained around Rp 7,724,413,092 and a profit of Rp 2,574,804,364. The benefits of intangiables obtained from the operation are the emergence of new tourist attractions in the cities of Surabaya and Bangkalan. Table 6.1 Recapitulations and comparation of the existing condition and the converted ship benefit In addition, in the calculation of the BCR Analysis, the BCR value is 1.9.

755,An Efficient Heuristic Method For Dynamic Berth Allocation  Problem,"the bottle neck of maritime transportation is the time spent by vessels at a container terminal (ct). time is money for the logistic business and hence the time spent by a vessel at the ct results in major part of losses for the customer: transport companies. as a result, they strive for shorter stay time at ct. in order to survive in the competition by satisfying their customers every ct works on minimizing the turnaround time of vessel (ttv). the ttv varies across all berths. therefore, allocation of vessel to berth in order to minimize the ttv is the prime objective of the ct. thus, this study focuses on dynamic berth allocation problem (bap), considering discrete berth layout. a mixed integer linear programming (milp) model is proposed with the objective of minimizing the total finish time of all vessels. further, a simple heuristic method (hm), based on early-to-finish strategy, for generating a feasible solution is developed. finally, the quality of the solution obtained from the proposed hm is compared with the exact solution obtained from the proposed milp model on 10 problem instances and observed empirically that the proposed hm provides efficient/optimal solutions in almost all the 7 instances.",container terminal,"Almost all the studies on BAP assume that the expected handling time is given. In this study a method for estimating the handling time of the vessels is proposed. Considering the estimated handling time of vessels,a MILP model and a simple heuristic method are proposed at address BAP. There are 10 numerical examples are randomly generated to reflect the problem configuration defined in this study. Each of the 10 instances are solved using both the proposed MILP and heuristic method. Out of 10 instances, the proposed heuristic method yielded optimal solution for 7 instances. When the number of vessels and number of berths increase, it is difficult to use the proposed MILP model as benchmark procedure. So, developing a lower bound is one of the immediate research directions for the problem considered in this study. Furthermore, proposing a few more simple heuristics to meta heuristics are additional interested future research issues for the problem considered in this study.","p. u. ankita and m. mathirajan department of management studies, indian institute of science, bangalore, india email: ankigcek@gmail.com and msdmathi@iisc.ac.in",
756,Freight Matching Strategies In Online Spot Market For  Balancing Shipper And Platform Performance,"freight matching strategy is an essential aspect of balancing the trade-offs between platform performance and user performance, particularly in the online freight transportation spot market. the online freight transportation market where the sellers provide services for transporting bulk product using one-time purchase transaction has variability in carrier availability and the rate the rate that increase the pairing process's complexity. this study analyzes the matching process of carriers and shippers in the online freight transportation spot market platform to balance the platform’s profit as well as shipper’s reliability. a simulation approach is used to capture the complexity and uncertainties in the system. we find that the matching strategies significantly affect the platform’s profit and shipment reliability. the balance between the platform and the shipper’s intentions is obtained by putting equal weight on the carriers’ rates and distance to the pickup location. the finding will help the online spot market platforms deliver the balance strategy in pairing their demand and therefore improve the supply chain performances.","matching strategy, online spot market, on-demand sourcing","In this study, we have developed a simulation study that models the matching process of transportation provider sourcing in the online spot market platform. The experiment has been conducted to analyze the several matching strategies in pairing shipment load with the available transportation providers. The proposed matching strategies significantly affect the platform’s profit and shipment reliability. The balance between the shipper and platform’s intentions is obtained by equally weight the transport providers’ rates and distance to the pickup location. The results of this study help the online spot market platforms generate the matching algorithm that balances the platform and user’s intention. Therefore, the platforms can improve the supply chain performances. The further direction of this study should be able to take into account the transportation providers’ interests. We realize that the user of the platform is not only the shippers but also the transportation provider. Thus, generating the balance for all parties will be beneficial for the supply chain performance. Considering the various level of bargaining position among the players are important. The matching process is conducted within the platform’s system, and therefore the weight in the attributes is not necessarily equal. Thus, various weights are also necessary to study.

758,Modeling An Efficient Cold Chain For Ice Cream  Manufacturing In Papua New Guinea,"the cold chain is of critical importance in sustaining the ice cream quality from manufacturing to retail freezers. a high performing cold chain in a country has been demonstrated to have lower post-harvest losses. papua new guinea (png) rated poor on its cold chain situation including local frozen and chilled products and this study considered one of the most trusted ice cream manufacturing companies in png with an average market share of 80%. the study focused on the current cold chain system of an ice cream manufacturer situated in png and analyze its cold chain efficiency using various analysis and design tools such as strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (swot) analysis, value engineering, systems analysis and design, and total quality management. the study showed that strong internal and external maintenance strategies, real-time temperature logging of manufacturing plant and storage freezing, and senior management support in cold chain initiatives are the strong points of the ice cream manufacturer. energy usage reduction by 22%, energy sub-metering, and preventive action plans for retail freezing breakdowns were the improvement points for the company. the study also indicated the technical requirements for real-time data monitoring for retail container freezers which complimented the business requirements from the manufacturer’s senior management.","cold chain, ice cream, supply chain, papua new guinea","Developing countries contribute 23% of global losses due to low-performance cold chain. Papua New Guinea was rated “poor” in the cold chain situation of frozen and chilled products. This study focused on evaluating the cold chain management efficiency of one of Papua New Guinea’s ice cream manufacturers. The study identified challenges in the ice cream manufacturers' current cold chain management such as high cost of electricity cost per cartons of ice cream, lack of energy metering devices, high breakdown occurrences from retail freezers, lack of effective monitoring on retail freezers temperature, and unauthorized repair of retail freezers by customer. Using various systems and analysis tools such as FMEA, QFD, functional analysis, and systems design, the manufacturer’s key processes and issues in operations were evaluated. Some of the the recommendations to improve the ice cream manufacturer’s cold chain efficiency are to invest on projects of variable speed drive motors, overhaul maintenance on retail freezers, implement a nationwide real-time temperature monitoring and data logging of retail freezers, incur credit on customer for breach on Freezer Agreement Form, implement customer location assessment, and install energy metering with data logging in manufacturing plant. The specific requirements to attain the efficient cold chain by the ice cream manufacturer include Real-time data monitoring of process cooling and storage freezers, Strong maintenance strategy of manufacturing plant & storage freezing equipment, Standardize energy metering with data logging to identify high energy consumption, Convert direct drive motors to variable speed drive to reduce energy consumption, Strengthen overhauling maintenance of retail freezers, Implement real-time temperature monitoring and data logging of retail freezers, Review freezer agreement form for a customer to have more accountability on retail freezers, and Implementation of customer location assessment before installation of retail freezers.

(2020) evaluated ph.d. in technology management programs in the usa. in this study, ph.d. in engineering management programs in the us, south africa, italy, the uk, and the uae are contrasted to that initial study. focus is upon the admissions requirements and curriculum aspects of these two program fields. admissions and curriculum aspects including career goal statements by students relative to educational outcomes are examined. gre and gmat, bachelor’s and master's degrees, and industry or other experiences for admissions requirements are other considerations in this study. curriculum differences and similarities, including statistics & probability, research methods, management, technical proficiencies, length of study, accreditation, publication, and venues of publication, are considered too. the study found that many similarities and differences in admission criteria and curriculum exist. the nominal, technology management versus engineering management, difference, is due to the focus upon either engineering or technology from the degree-granting university. this study will help students, industry, and government organizations seeking to match technology and engineering qualifications with the appropriate ph.d. curriculum.","doctoral degree, management",", concerning both EM and TM program fields, the admissions criteria are similar, yet with a few distinctions. An emphasis on an engineering background appears slightly more pronounced toward admissions to the EM Ph.D. programs than for TM Ph.D. admissions. Many of the EM universities have requirements of calculus, engineering analysis, and physics background slightly more pronounced than for the TM universities. In terms of curriculum, engineering management programs cover a wide range of courses and areas such as risk analysis, marketing system analysis, engineering design optimization, economic analysis, etc. However, research methods, project management, technology management, and such courses are standard in both programs. English proficiency as a requirement seems germane to both EM and TM programs, both domestically to the USA and internationally. Compared to TM Ph.D. programs, the number of credit hours beyond the MS degree for EM Ph.D. program varies more. Industry experience does not appear to be an essential admission requirement for either EM or TM Ph.D. programs field, yet it is germane to only US programs when cited as a requirement. The Technology Management Ph.D. programs appear comparatively less expensive from a tuition and fees perspective than the Engineering Management Ph.D. programs. Finally, Ph.D. degrees in engineering management and technology management will continue to be attractive to students for professional career growth and leadership attainment, either in academy or industry, through multidisciplinary knowledge and skills development provided in the type of Ph.D. programs.","sheikh f. ferdous, m. affan badar, james n. mckirahan, and a. mehran shahhosseini department of applied engineering and technology management indiana state university terre haute, in 47809, usa sheikh.ferdous@indstate.edu, m.affan.badar@indstate.edu, james.mckirahan@indstate.edu, mehran.shahhosseini@indstate.edu",
