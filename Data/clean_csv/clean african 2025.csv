6,Doi: 10.46254/Af06.20250010,"this study investigates the axial crushing behaviour of carbon fiber reinforced polymeric (cfrp) tubes, both hollow and filled with polyurethane (pu) foam infused with varying amounts and sizes of milled glass fibres. the micro- glass fibres were added to the foam during the manufacturing process to enhance its shear properties. different weight percentage and sizes of the microfibers were studied. after full curing, composite tubes were subjected to axial crushing tests. properties like load-bearing capacity, energy absorption, crushing efficiency, and specific energy absorption were studied. the results showed that finer 1/32-inch fibres significantly enhance load bearing and energy absorption in foam-filled tubes, with the 1-32 5% configuration demonstrating the highest performance. on the other hand, the non-filled cfrp tube exhibited the highest specific energy, indicating superior energy absorption efficiency relative to its weight.","micro-fibres, axial crush, carbon tube, compression test, crashworthiness","In this study, CFRP tubes with and without foam filler were subjected to axial crushing tests, and the results were analyzed. The effect of infusing foam filler with different sizes and weight percentages of milled glass fiber was also examined. The experimental analysis revealed changes in properties such as load bearing, energy absorption, and crushing efficiency of the composite tubes studied. The study showed that introducing milled glass fibers into PU foam within CFRP tubes significantly influences the crushing characteristics of the composite. Notably, the composite with 1/32 5% fibers achieved a peak strength of 12 kN, significantly higher than the NF tube's performance of 8.4 kN, with the composite with 0% fibers exhibiting a strength of 11.3 kN. This indicates that the 1/32 fiber size contributes to better load distribution and overall strength, emphasizing the importance of optimizing fiber dimensions for improved structure. It was found that larger fibers (1/16 5% and 1/16 20%) exhibit lower energy absorption (~0.45 kJ) and specific energy (~20 J/g) due to fiber agglomeration, which hinders load transfer and weakens the composite. Achieving a balance between total energy absorption and specific energy is crucial, as improper fiber size and dispersion can lead to inefficient load transfer. Proper optimization of these factors is essential to enhance the mechanical performance and structural integrity of fiber-reinforced composites. The analysis of crushing force efficiency shows that the 20% sample with smaller 1/32-inch fibers at higher concentrations (1/32) achieves the highest efficiency, around 80%, in converting applied force into energy absorption. In contrast, the NF sample demonstrates the lowest efficiency. Future work could further optimize fiber parameters to improve crashworthiness in automotive and aerospace applications.

11,Doi: 10.46254/Af06.20250036,"healthcare systems are challenged globally to provide high quality care while managing limited resources and budgets. radiology departments provide critical diagnostic services to nearly every medical discipline. delays in imaging services can unnecessarily extend patient hospital stays and lead to overcrowding in inpatient departments. therefore, any inefficiencies in radiology can have a cascading effects on the operations of other departments and the hospital performance as a whole. despite the importance of improving workflow efficiency in radiology departments, little attention has been paid to detailed case studies that investigate its specific challenges. this study addresses this gap by applying a simulation-based analysis to a radiology department in a major hospital in saudi arabia. a validated discrete event simulation model was developed through a comprehensive analysis of historical records and close collaboration with stakeholders. the findings highlight the transformative potential of simulation in providing actionable insights for healthcare managers and enhancing the department performance. the results of scenario 2 (demand-based scheduling) outperformed those of scenario 1 (adjusted staffing), achieving a 60% improvement in resource utilization and 40% cost savings relative to the baseline model. however, implementing demand-based scheduling introduces greater scheduling complexity and may lead to increased staff resistance. a phased transition strategy is suggested to maximize long-term benefits while minimizing disruptions to operations. future research should focus on empirical validation through assessing the implementation in real-world hospital setting to strengthen the applicability of the findings.","healthcare, simulation, modelling","The radiology function serves as a cornerstone of healthcare services, enabling essential diagnosis that underpin patient care. In this study, the operations of radiology were simulated to assess and enhance patient workflow. A tailored simulation model was developed to address the department’s needs while focusing on its core function. The analysis of historical data combined with stakeholders input enabled the development of a realistic and valid model. This simulation model allows for evaluating the current workflow to identify key bottlenecks, formulate intervention strategies and test potential scenarios that minimize patient waiting times and improve productivity. The analysis of the baseline revealed that resources were underutilized with opportunities to enhance the productivity while adhering to waiting times targets. The proposed interventions include: Scenario 1 (Adjusted Staffing) and Scenario 2 (Demand-Based Scheduling). These experiments confirmed that both scenarios improve sonographer utilization compared to the baseline model while average patient waiting times remain within the target level. The results of Scenario 2 outperformed those of Scenario 1, achieving a 60% improvement in resource utilization and 40% cost savings relative to the baseline model. However, implementing demand-based scheduling introduces greater scheduling complexity and may lead to increased staff resistance. Scenario 1 is easier to implement as it involves a relatively smaller reduction in the number of sonographers while maintaining the existing shift structure. A phased transition strategy is suggested to maximize long-term benefits while minimizing disruptions to operations. The proposed strategy begins with implementation of Scenario 1 while elements of Scenario 2 are incorporated gradually. While this study provides valuable insights, some limitations should be acknowledged. The analysis relies on historical data assuming stable patient inflow rate, which may not account for sudden unexpected fluctuations such as emergencies with high number of cases. In addition, the model assumes changes to the baseline are applied without significant change resistance, which may not hold true in practice. A further study could integrate workforce considerations by investigating the relationship between shift structure and length on staff well-being and performance. In addition, future research should focus on empirical validation through assessing the implementation in real-world hospital setting to strengthen the applicability of the findings.","improving radiology workflow efficiency: insights from simulation-based operational modeling abdullah alrabghi department of industrial and systems engineering university of jeddah, jeddah, saudi arabia aalrabghi@uj.edu.sa","References

The 15 ml capacity and 9.3 MPa injection pressure are the most suitable results across the scoop designs After selecting the 15 ml to be injected further optimization is made to reach a lower pressure, this is made by changing the melt temperature and mold temperature in simulations and observe the injection pressure response to these changes.

At melt temperature of 240°C and mold temperature of 50 the part has the lowest injection pressure 2. The part has a higher injection pressure after decreasing the mold temperature to 30°C Conclusions: 1. As melt temperature increase the injection pressure decreases because the molten plastic in the sprue solidifies slower than usual so less injection pressure is needed. 2. As mold temperature increase the injection pressure decreases because the wall of the mold keeps the material molten for a longer time which makes the flow easier and reduces the shear rate.

26,Doi: 10.46254/Af06.20250064,"this study focuses on enhancing the level of service in medical consultations at medsalud medical center through the implementation of lean six sigma methodologies. medsalud currently faces challenges such as excessive waiting times, inadequate infrastructure, and a lack of automation in administrative processes. using the dmaic framework, key problem areas were identified, including inefficient manual processes and limited operational capacity. solutions include automating patient registration, optimizing physical space with systematic layout planning (slp), and standardizing processes. indicators such as average waiting time, consultation duration, and net promoter score (nps) were used to measure effectiveness. the proposed improvements aim to reduce waiting times from 67 to 49 minutes, align consultation times with industry standards, and increase patient satisfaction by 10.87 percentage points. this research highlights the potential of lean six sigma to improve efficiency and patient experience in medical centers, ensuring sustainable operational practices.","lean six signa, service level","In conclusion, this study demonstrated that the implementation of Lean Six Sigma methodologies at MedSalud Medical Center achieved significant advancements in improving the quality of medical consultation services, addressing the main operational challenges identified. During the Define phase, the root causes of inefficiencies, such as prolonged waiting times and limited infrastructure capacity, were diagnosed using tools like the Ishikawa Diagram. These tools provided a comprehensive understanding of the issues, laying the groundwork for selecting specific solutions. In the Improve phase, the interventions implemented included process automation through ticket kiosks and advanced software, as well as physical space redistribution using Systematic Layout Planning (SLP). According to estimates obtained from simulations in Arena, these improvements reduced the average waiting time from 61 minutes to 46.75 minutes and shortened the average consultation time from 40 minutes to 28 minutes. Although the achieved Net Promoter Score (NPS) of 48.75% fell short of the projected goal of 50%, this result represents significant progress, highlighting the positive impact of the interventions on the patient experience and establishing a foundation for future enhancements. Additionally, the analyses and simulations validated the sustainability of these improvements, emphasizing how resource optimization and reorganization of the care flow directly contribute to operational efficiency. This study not only offers a replicable framework for clinics with similar characteristics but also underscores the importance of systematic approaches to addressing inefficiencies in healthcare environments with limited resources. Ultimately, MedSalud has demonstrated its commitment to operational excellence and continuous improvement, moving towards higher standards of quality and patient satisfaction.","improvement of medical consultation service level through the use of lean six sigma at medsalud medical centre kathia vásquez-moncada, luciana tejada-alarcón and carlos urbina-rivera carrera de ingeniería industrial universidad de lima lima, peru 20203796@aloe.ulima.edu.pe, 20202059@aloe.ulima.edu.pe, curbina@ulima.edu.pe","References

The objectives of this study are divided into two parts: exploring the current situation and making recommendations. Exploring the current situation entails investigating the hotel project, its risk factors, and the current state of hotel project risk management. Making recommendations entails making sound recommendations for the use of project risk management in hotel projects while taking the theoretical basis and the characteristics of hotel projects into account. To answer these questions, a qualitative method with semi-structured interviews was used. Firstly, this study identified the hotel projects that hotel managers encounter in their work (Table 3). It was also discovered that the hotel business currently implements projects independently of the day-to-day operations of the hotel and that most hotel managers are unaware of the projects. Secondly, this study classified the risk issues present in hotel projects (Table 4). The general risk issues observed in this study were identified and grouped into 11 categories and categorized as systemic and unsystematic risks. Within systemic risk, there are five risk categories: political, economic, environmental, technology, and covid-19. Unsystematic risks are subdivided into six categories: finance, demand, security, supply chain, customer behavior, and human resource risks. These risk categories in hotel projects are numerous and complex and interact with each other. And they are almost identical to the risks that exist in hotel operations. This shows that studying risk management in hotel projects is not only helpful for the smooth implementation and success of hotel projects, but also contributes to risk management in hotel operations, and even in the hotel industry.","risk management in chinese hotel projects: a qualitative exploratory study yao wang warwick manufacturing group university of warwick coventry cv4 7al, u.k. guru prabhakar bristol business school university of the west of england bristol- bs16 1qy, u.k. guru.prabhakar@uwe.ac.uk inese ratanova baltic international academy rīga, lv-1003, latvia inese.ratanova@gmail.com","References

The article presents the methodology adopted to quantify CO2 emissions in distance and the passage from a GCVRP multi-objective that minimizes two objectives, distance and CO2 emissions to a Virtual GCVRP mono-objective minimizing only one objective which is the virtual traveled distance. The M2 model has given good results justifying the possibility and feasibility of the methodology proposed in this work.

30,"An Assessment Of Sustainability Indicators For A Shipyard,  Utilizing The Analytic Hierarchy Process (Ahp)","sustainability and sustainable development are becoming more popular in the literature and are applied in many sectors since environmental concerns have increased globally. consequently, sustainability concerns have started to focus on shipyards, where all ships are constructed, repaired, maintained, and dismantled. since 90% of world trade merchandise is transported by ships, the shipbuilding sector has been concerned with energy efficiency and focused on either environment or emission-oriented research. however, sustainability has three dimensions: environmental, social, and economic. each innovation and transformation have a positive or negative impact on each of those dimensions. in addition, the shipyards should implement a simple approach or initiative to reach the necessary sustainability targets. therefore, the authors proposed modeling of identified indicators determined by the experts and used an analytical hierarchical process (ahp) method to prioritize the dimensions and indicators. the model is applied in a shipyard, and the economic dimension with profitability and revenue indicators was found to be significant. the shipyard evaluates environmental issues from an economic and social point of view, as shipyards face fierce global competition and the challenge of ensuring the availability of skilled labor with a minimum of accidents. surprisingly, environmental dimensions are not at the forefront because shipyards are not obliged to respect international standards like ports and ships sailing on the overseas.","shipyard, sustainability, ahp","Sustainability and sustainable development have gained importance globally. The shipyards where the ships are constructed, maintained, repaired, and dismantled are confronting new regulations, standards, or requirements about environment and sustainability due to the IMO emissions targets or international or local regulatory bodies and administrations. The shipyards are aware of these challenges and act to adapt to new situations. Regarding the incident, this study first aimed to evaluate the weighting of sustainability performance and then the performance indicators of each dimension, environmental, social, and economic respectively. The findings are summarized in Table 8. It is evident that the shipyards continue to emphasize the economic issues and then social issues of sustainability and sustainable dimension although the environmental issues are usually in the front to discuss. The reason is that shipyards engage in environmental issues but act regarding economic (mainly profit indicators) and social (mainly cost of labor force indicator) issues. The profitability indicator (Eco3) is ranked first position among the other performance indicators, enhancing the argument above. Revenue (Eco2) is in the second rank because it is one of the most important financial metrics that measure the company's performance and growth. Employee wages and benefits (Soc2) is the third indicator in the model and emphasizes the labor force's importance for revenue and profitability. The fourth indicator is Material cost (Eco4) which is also an important variable for profitability. Then comes work accidents (Soc4) because the accident rate has a linear and negative effect on a company's economic performance, Estudillo, et al. (2024)Estudillo, et al. (2024). Energy consumption (Env1) is ranked in the 6th position since shipbuilding is an energy-intensive sector, Vakili, et al. (2021). The other indicators ranking are Scrap recycled (Eco2), Average hours of training per employee (Soc1), Greenhouse gas emissions (Env4), attendance and absence days (Soc3), Hazardous waste (Env3), and Scrap recycled (Env4), respectively.

(2018). Surprisingly, environmental dimensions are not at the forefront because shipyards are not obliged to respect international standards like ports and ships sailing on the overseas.","mehmet tantan department of naval architecture and marine engineering istanbul technical university (itu) istanbul, türkiye tantan18@itu.edu.tr hatice camgöz akdağ department of business engineering istanbul technical university (itu) istanbul, türkiye camgozakdag@itu.edu.tr","References

31,Doi: 10.46254/Af06.20250086,"variational autoencoders (vaes) represent a powerful generative ai tool that learns the underlying structure of input data and generates new data. this paper applies vaes to model complex, real-world demand distributions in the context of inventory management. existing research often relies on traditional methods, such as linear regression or gaussian mixture models, which frequently struggle to capture the non-linear and multimodal nature of actual demand patterns. vaes utilize deep neural networks to learn intricate patterns within data and map them to a regularized latent space, enabling the generation of novel demand scenarios. consequently, using vaes could result in finding the optimal order quantity more accurately. we hypothesize that vaes empower businesses to make data-driven decisions to optimize inventory levels and minimize costs, providing a robust and adaptable framework for inventory management compared to traditional approaches. to test our hypothesis, we simulate ten sets of demand distributions with complex patterns and shapes and use vaes to model these demand patterns. based on the distributions identified by the vaes, we calculate the optimal order quantity and expected profits. we then compare these results to scenarios where demand is assumed to follow traditional distributions, including normal, poisson, erlang, and uniform distributions. our findings reveal that, in most cases, the vae-based approach outperforms the approaches that use traditional distributional assumptions. this research demonstrates the potential of vaes to contribute to inventory management by providing a more accurate and flexible approach to modeling demand variability, ultimately leading to significant cost savings and improved operational efficiency.","demand forecasting, generative ai","The comparison between the two approaches—one using a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to estimate the demand distribution and the other assuming a normal distribution—demonstrates the clear advantages of the VAE-based method. The profit trends in the VAE-generated model exhibit greater stability and higher average profitability compared to the normal distribution approach, which shows more fluctuations and lower overall profits. This suggests that the normal distribution assumption may oversimplify the underlying demand structure, failing to capture complex variations and real-world uncertainties. In contrast, the VAE effectively learns intricate demand patterns from data, allowing for a more precise estimation of the true demand distribution. This, in turn, leads to more informed inventory decisions and improved profitability in the newsvendor setting. Future research can explore further enhancements to the VAE framework, such as incorporating additional external factors like seasonality, economic trends, and competitor behavior into the model to refine demand estimation. Additionally, integrating reinforcement learning with VAEs could provide adaptive decision-making strategies that dynamically adjust inventory levels based on real-time data. Investigating the robustness of VAEs in handling sparse or limited data scenarios is another promising direction, as real-world demand data may often be incomplete or noisy. Overall, our findings highlight the potential of deep learning models in supply chain optimization, paving the way for more intelligent and data-driven inventory management solutions.","generative ai for inventory management: a vae-based approach to demand modeling mohammad arbabian, naga vemprala assistant professor pamplin school of business university of portland portland, or, usa arbabian@up.edu, vemprala@up.edu naveen gudigantala associate professor pamplin school of business university of portland portland, or, usa gudigant@up.edu","References

These shortcomings lead to passenger discomfort and increased injury risk, as current dimensions do not align with Filipino anthropometric measurements. Poor ergonomic design affects factors like posture, legroom, and cushioning, resulting in health issues such as musculoskeletal strains. Using Gaussian probability distribution, the study identified the percentage of Filipino passengers experiencing discomfort with existing measurements. Proposed adjustments to seat height, depth, width, and ceiling height, as detailed in Table 5, aim to enhance travel comfort for Filipino commuters.","analyzing passenger comfort in modern jeepneys: measuring compatibility with the anthropometric measurements of metro manila commuters prof. carlos ignacio lugay jr., phd, pie, asean engr. professor/adviser department of industrial engineering university of santo tomas españa boulevard, sampaloc, manila, philippines cplugay@ust.edu.ph edward p. atencio, eugene mark g. bagahansol, aren carlo s. batenga, and shigeki c. uchida bachelor of science in industrial engineering university of santo tomas españa boulevard, sampaloc, manila, philippines edward.atencio.eng@ust.edu.ph, eugenemark.bagahansol.eng@ust.edu.ph, arencarlo.batenga.eng@ust.edu.ph, shigeki.uchida.eng@ust.edu.ph",

39,Doi: 10.46254/Af06.20250096,"cloud computing is one of the latest commercial ideas that has become popular and provides users with limitless access to virtual resources. task scheduling in cloud computing refers to assigning vms to cloud tasks. due to service demand costs associated with the usage of software and hardware, such as bandwidth, storage, and processing, effective task scheduling and balancing the usage of vms are essential for increasing data center efficiency and reducing energy consumption. therefore, using an effective task scheduling algorithm that minimizes makespan and maximizes resource utilization is crucial. in many studies, different algorithms—such as min-min, max-min, and adaptive incremental genetic algorithm (aiga)—have been developed to solve this problem, and these algorithms are used on many platforms. the goal of this study is to compare commonly used heuris tic-based algorithms, which include min-min and max-min, bio-inspired algorithm aiga, and offer an exact solution guarantee through the exhaustive learning optimization algorithm (eloa). with this aim, the instance types of amazon ec2 have been used to implement virtual machines with various computing capacities on cloudsim. the results show that min-min and max-min algorithms provide computationally efficient feasible solutions, and aiga also provides feasible solutions with adaptive and efficient processes. finally, eloa provides an optimal solution that minimizes makespan. this makes min-min, max-min, and aiga suitable for large-scale task scheduling in cloud computing, while eloa is a great choice for small-scale problems.","cloud computing, task scheduling, virtual machines, optimization","To minimize the computational costs and conserve energy, efficient allocation of resources and the minimization of the time required to complete all the tasks, i.e. makespan, is crucial in the realm of cloud task scheduling. Among the strategies employed to address these challenges are the heuristic algorithms Min-Min and Max-Min, as well as the bio-inspired AIGA. While ELOA demands substantial computational power, it excels in smaller projects where sufficient resources are available. In order to identify the most efficient task order while ensuring the best possible outcome, this algorithm takes a constructive approach by thoroughly evaluates all possible task sequence. However, its exhaustive nature makes it computationally intensive. Our findings indicate that while heuristic-based algorithms like Min-Min, Max-Min, and AIGA operate efficiently and help control computing costs, they don’t always guarantee the optimal solution. For smaller-scale projects where precision is paramount, ELOA is often the superior choice, as it rigorously evaluates all potential solutions to find the best one. Among the heuristic approaches, AIGA performs closely to ELOA, while the Max-Min algorithm also proves to be a strong alternative. Notably, the makespan difference between Min-Min and ELOA can fluctuate more significantly than that between Max-Min and ELOA, highlighting the varying performance of these strategies across different cloud computing scenarios Further research could explore hybrid algorithms that merge the efficiency of heuristic methods with the thoroughness of exhaustive approaches. These hybrids may provide a well-balanced trade-off between computational efficiency and solution accuracy, especially for medium- to large-scale applications. Additionally, evaluating these algorithms in edge computing environments—where data is processed closer to its source—could be advantageous, given the growing role of edge computing in reducing latency for cloud services.","optimizing task scheduling in cloud computing: a comparative analysis of min-min, max-min, aiga, and eloa kıvılcım naz böke department of industrial engineering çankaya university ankara, türkiye c2012056@student.cankaya.edu.tr syed shah sultan mohiuddin qadri department of industrial engineering çankaya university ankara, türkiye syedshahsultan@cankaya.edu.tr ahmet kabarcık department of industrial engineering çankaya university ankara, türkiye a.kabarcik@cankaya.edu.tr",
40,Doi: 10.46254/Sa06.20250097,"critical chain project management (ccpm) has proven effective in enhancing the efficiency of resource-constrained and time-sensitive projects, especially in high-stakes environments such as military engineering. in the corps of engineers, armed forces of the philippines (ceafp), where complex infrastructure and disaster response projects often encounter delays and resource allocation inefficiencies, ccpm offers a systematic framework for improvement. this research integrates data from ceafp’s annual reports to analyze ccpm’s potential applications and impacts on project outcomes. by reviewing case studies of two key projects—the construction of an ammunition dump and a disaster response facility—the study demonstrates ccpm’s ability to optimize project timelines, resource allocation, and fund utilization. findings show a 15% improvement in resource efficiency and reduced project delays by 20%, highlighting ccpm’s role in fostering operational excellence within ceafp’s engineering initiatives. recommendations for institutionalizing ccpm within ceafp’s project management processes are also discussed.",corps of engineers,"and Recommendations 6.1 Conclusion The integration of Critical Chain Project Management (CCPM) in the planning and execution of CEAFP engineering projects has yielded substantial gains in terms of schedule adherence, optimized resource utilization, and overall cost savings. The comparative analysis of projects before and after CCPM implementation—specifically the Ammunition Dump and Disaster Response Facility—revealed marked reductions in project duration and budget overruns, while also demonstrating increased operational efficiency. These outcomes provide empirical support for CCPM’s relevance as a systematic, scientifically grounded methodology tailored to the dynamic and resource-constrained conditions of military engineering environments. Thus, CCPM emerges as a transformative model for project delivery that aligns with the CEAFP's dual mandate of national defense readiness and socio-economic support through infrastructure development. 6.2 Recommendations Institutionalizing CCPM. To fully leverage the advantages of CCPM, it is recommended that the approach be institutionalized within CEAFP’s standard project management framework. This entails embedding CCPM principles and practices into official project management guidelines, operational protocols, and organizational workflows. Formal adoption would ensure consistency in execution and foster a culture of disciplined planning, buffer management, and task prioritization. Institutionalization would also facilitate smoother collaboration across different units and stakeholders by providing a unified language and process model for managing engineering projects. Capacity Building. A critical component of sustaining CCPM implementation is capacity development among CEAFP personnel. As reflected in the 2022 Annual Report, ongoing training programs exist; however, these should be expanded to incorporate CCPM-specific modules. These modules should cover core concepts such as the identification of critical chains, buffer sizing and management, task dependency mapping, and resource constraint resolution. It is also recommended to adopt a tiered training structure, with introductory sessions for general staff and advanced workshops for project managers and technical officers. Simulation-based learning and case study analysis may further enhance conceptual understanding and practical application.","critical chain project management for military engineering: case studies from the corps of engineers, armed forces of the philippines romalyn l galingan associate professor technological institute of the philippines quezon city, philippines rgalingan.ie@tip.edu.ph","References

Structural Equation Modelling and the data gathered revealed that net income and emotional status significantly impact consumers' impulse buying behavior, as evidenced by their respective P-values (0.001). These results validate the hypothesis that a consumer's financial and emotional state is crucial to purchasing decisions on TikTok live selling platforms. In contrast, other factors, such as discounted prices and brand familiarity, showed less significance in directly affecting impulse buying behavior. Relating to theories such as Diffusion of Innovation, Elaboration Likelihood, and Impulse Buying, the study highlights how emotional and financial conditions influence consumers' purchasing behavior. The results indicate that individuals with higher net income or potent emotional triggers are more likely to engage in impulse buying. Additionally, the study employed statistical validation methods to ensure the reliability of the findings, reinforcing the significance of financial and emotional factors in driving consumer decisions in live-selling environments. The results of this study also support a number of important conclusions from prior studies about consumers’ impulse buying behavior. Specifically, results show that there is a significant correlation between consumer income and impulsive purchases which mirrors the findings of Rani & S (2023). However, in the study conducted by Rani & S (2023), it was found that discounts and offers have a significant impact on consumers’ impulse buying behavior, while our analysis indicated no statistically significant association. It is worth noting that the results from Zhang et al. (2022) provide supporting evidence to our findings by also finding little to no correlation between discounts and impulse buying behavior. The result of this study also shows that there is a significant correlation between consumers’ emotional state and their impulse buying behavior. This can be related to the findings of the study by Gottumukkala et al. (2023), which shows that impulse purchases are often driven by consumers’ feelings and momentary urges rather than logic. Based on the findings of the study, the researchers suggest that retailers should leverage emotional triggers of consumers as well as their desire to reflect their lifestyles. The researchers suggest that retailers prioritize a marketing strategy centered around the emotions of their target consumers. The fear of missing out (FOMO), jealousy on other consumers, and happiness are just some of the factors that retailers may use to their advantage for their marketing strategies. They may also use consumer and live-seller engagement to their advantage to create a bond between subjects to increase purchase. For the sellers, they can show testimonials or videos from happy customers to build trust and emotional relatability. Additionally, personalizing interactions with buyers by greeting viewers by name and responding to their comments can help make consumers feel acknowledged, boosting emotional connection. For brands, adapting pricing strategies, like tiered pricing models, can appeal to consumers across different income levels. As for social status, consumers with higher social status may feel a greater need to maintain or enhance their social image. With this, retailers can focus on building a brand image and aesthetic that appeals to the social status of their target market to create an appeal to their consumers. Retailers can utilize paid advertising and commercializing their products to catch the attention of these types of consumers.","evaluating the factors on impulse buying behavior in tiktok live selling of beauty and cosmetics in the philippines yman sebastian m. cruz, kayla t. lirio, andre christian a. ordoña, clarence b. panghulan, joshua bryan g. valmonte students, department of industrial engineering, faculty of engineering, university of santo tomas, españa boulevard, sampaloc, manila, 1008, philippines ymansebastian.cruz.eng@ust.edu.ph, kayla.lirio.eng@ust.edu.ph, andrechristian.ordona.eng@ust.edu.ph, clarence.panghulan.eng@ust.edu.ph, joshuabryan.valmonte.eng@ust.edu.ph carlos ignacio p. lugay jr. professor, department of industrial engineering, faculty of engineering, university of santo tomas, españa boulevard, sampaloc, manila, 1008, philippines cplugay@ust.edu.ph","References

46,Doi: 10.46254/Af06.20250104,"the aviation sector in the philippines offers various local and commercial airlines, with mainline, regional, and charter airlines operating in different sectors. this study discussed the research opportunity to determine the airline preferences among filipinos in association with the servqual model and rational choice theory. the variables conceptualized in relation to airline preferences show the independent variables derived from the rational choice theory, namely customer lifestyle, flight comfort, and flight (airline) safety. partial least square - structural equation modelling (pls-sem) was used to assess the structural importance of independent variables in relation to dependent variables. 625 filipinos were gathered to assess these factors, with the respondents being filipino citizens, at least 18 years old, and having traveled through air transportation at least once in their lifetime. having 622 valid responses out of 625, results showed that in the servqual model, customer satisfaction is the most significant factor in filipinos’ perceived airline preference, while for the rational choice theory, it was found that customer lifestyle had the strongest influence on resource allocation. given these, it was recommended that airlines should prioritize improving their overall service quality and focus on aligning their services and marketing strategies to different lifestyle preferences.","air transportation, tourism, satisfaction","Philippine Airlines carried 11 million passengers by the end of September. This was more than the 6.4 million passengers in the same period last year and the 9.3 million passengers for the whole of 2022. Meanwhile, Cebu Pacific saw its passenger volume shoot up by 48.8 percent to 15.5 million (Piad 2023). With the gradual return of operations in airlines and given these increases in demand as well as the forecasted increase in revenue, airlines have incorporated several strategies to accommodate these. However, there is no assurance that these will become effective, given the fluctuation in the market. Using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) in SmartPLS, results from 622 respondents revealed that Customer Satisfaction (ß = 0.718, p = 0.000) is the strongest determinant of airline preference, suggesting that Filipino airline passengers are more likely to choose an airline that guarantees safety and transparency. Assurance (ß = 0.276, p = 0.000) primarily drives satisfaction, indicating that courteous service influences Filipino travelers. Under Rational Choice Theory, Resource Allocation (ß = 0.160, p = 0.000) is the strongest factor in airline preference, mainly driven by Customer Lifestyle (ß = 0.472, p = 0.000). Insignificant relationships were found between Flight Comfort and Resource Allocation (p = 0.227) and Societal Norms and Airline Preference (p = 0.343). This study provides further discussion and data specific to the Philippines since most available literature on this topic is outdated, requires updates in data and literature, and is mainly global in scope. The integration of the Rational Choice Theory and SERVQUAL presents a unique perspective on how individuals go about their approach regarding airline preference. The study emphasizes service quality using the SERVQUAL Model, highlighting Filipinos' preference for airlines prioritizing safety, transparency, and customer service. Philippine Airlines' drop in Skytrax rankings signals the need for improvements, while competitors like Singapore Airlines and Qatar Airways excel through service excellence and strategic partnerships. Under the Rational Choice Theory, Filipino passengers value loyalty programs and sustainability-driven services. The liberalization of the Philippine air transport industry improved competition, reduced fares, and enhanced service, with technological advancements playing a key role. Philippine Airlines' mobile app demonstrates the impact of digital transformation on engagement and sales. It is recommended that airlines integrate digital solutions further to enhance customer experience and operational efficiency. Customer satisfaction, driven by assurance, is the strongest factor influencing airline preference. Airlines should enhance interactive safety briefings and cultural training while offering personalized services and lifestyle- based packages. Marketing should emphasize functional benefits rather than prioritizing societal norm factors. Future studies are recommended to explore demographic-specific insights, emotional influences, and qualitative perspectives. These strategies can strengthen airline competitiveness and align services with evolving passenger expectations for long-term industry success.","determining factors affecting perceived airline preference among filipinos: an integration of servqual and rational choice theories gionas d. camarillo1, sophia ann e. lacson1, christopher s. que1, ven yshee b. velasquez1, yoshiki b. kurata1,2,3 1department of industrial engineering, faculty of engineering, university of santo tomas, manila, philippines 2research center for social sciences and education, university of santo tomas, manila, philippines 3management engineering program cluster, graduate school, university of santo tomas, manila, philippines gionas.camarillo.eng@ust.edu.ph, sophiaann.lacson.eng@ust.edu.ph, christopher.que.eng@ust.edu.ph, venyshee.velasquez.eng@ust.edu.ph, ybkurata@ust.edu.ph",

By analyzing various demographic, individual-related, work-related, and environmental factors, the research determined that work duration, work tools, drinking habits, and smoking significantly contribute to the prevalence of WMSDs. The findings highlighted that increased alcohol consumption, smoking frequency, prolonged work duration, and dissatisfaction with work tools lead to higher levels of musculoskeletal discomfort. Conversely, factors such as age, gender, BMI, work posture, heat exposure, and noise exposure showed no significant relationship with WMSDs, suggesting that their variations do not directly impact the condition. A key contribution of this study is its empirical evidence on an overlooked labor sector, reinforcing the urgent need for ergonomic interventions and policy improvements tailored to street sweepers' working conditions. The cost-benefit analysis further demonstrated that with minimal financial investment and behavioral changes, the health and well- being of street sweepers can significantly improve.

A mathematical model is developed to solve mentioned problem. Two different order groups which contain 20 and 25 randomly generated customer orders are used and for each group 20 different experiments are conducted. The results of the experiments showed that if order splitting strategy is followed to solve order batching and assignment problem, constructing multiple depots will be beneficial to decrease total order picking distances. As future researches, a new heuristic algorithm can be developed to solve this problem for large-size problem. In addition to this, the effect of applied storage strategy can be analyzed with the above mentioned problem scope. Especially, mixed-storage strategy can be integrated to mathematical model and results can be analyzed.","analyzing the effect of multiple depots under order splitting strategy while solving order batching and assignment problem selma gülyeşil research assistant department of industrial engineering gaziantep islam science and technology university gaziantep, 27010, türkiye selma.gulyesil@gibtu.edu.tr zeynep didem unutmaz durmuşoğlu professor department of industrial engineering samsun university samsun, 55060, türkiye didem.durmusoglu@samsun.edu.tr","References

The findings through the regression model were able to reveal that the factors Effort Expectancy (EE), Performance Expectancy (PE), Facilitating Conditions (FC), Hedonic Motivation (HM), Habit (HB), Ethical Considerations (EC), Perceived Risk (PR), Attitude (ATT), Region, and Gender all significantly affect how Generation Z utilizes text-generative artificial intelligence. This highlights Generation Z’s uniqueness towards curiosity, exploration, and risk-taking as the key characteristics that shape how they perceive life and embrace technology. Curiosity is a way in which they seek new experiences and explore a different perspective in what they do. Their risk-taking drives them to seek fulfillment and engage in new activities regardless of the consequences as long as the technology satisfies them (Salleh et al. 2017; Lopez and Abadiano 2023). Their region or area is a significant factor in Generation Z's behavioral intention to utilize text-generative artificial intelligence. This is true for the Philippines as one of the inequalities still prevalent in the nation lies in digital access, where those coming from rural areas have slow to no internet access, which affects how they utilize artificial intelligence as this requires internet access (Alibudbud 2024). Gender also affects the intention to use artificial intelligence as the different perceptions of artificial intelligence affect how each gender utilizes this tool, where males have a more positive view of the applications of artificial intelligence and trust it more than females (Armutat et al. 2024). Overall, this study identified the key factors that affect Generation Z's utilization of text-generative artificial intelligence in terms of their behavioral intention. This will give a better understanding of the current behavior and preferences of the generation that will help identify the right approach to addressing the growth of artificial intelligence in the Philippines.","analysis of generation z filipinos' perception of ai using multiple regression raphaela agatha r. albano1, aaron patrick h. basconcillo1, anne maxine m. dacayan1, jean louise b. orme1, yoshiki b. kurata1,2,3 1department of industrial engineering, faculty of engineering, university of santo tomas, manila, philippines 1,2,3research center for social sciences and education, university of santo tomas, manila, philippines management engineering program cluster, graduate school, university of santo tomas, manila, philippines raphaelaagatha.albano.eng@ust.edu.ph, aaronpatrick.basconcillo.eng@ust.edu.ph, annemaxine.dacayan.eng@ust.edu.ph, jeanlouise.orme.eng@ust.edu.ph, ybkurata@ust.edu.ph","References

The External controls variable was identified as the main constraint in terms of operating costs and speed, followed respectively by the Internal controls and Support services variables both in terms of operational speed. This suggests that the identified constraints collectively impact the competitiveness of the foundry negatively in terms of speed and cost. According to respondents, this is mainly due to: • Long procurement processes that must be followed when acquiring goods and services, • Challenges of not being able to directly do business with OEMs on many occasions as most of them do not meet some of the requirements stipulated in the – Public Finance Management Act South African government (PFMA) • Absence of investment in recruiting the workforce required to meet the demands, and • Lack of investment in advanced technologies that can improve production costs and efficiencies in Foundry X. So, in addressing these constraints using the TOC approach, the resources should be focused on elevating the External controls constraint, specifically on adopting policies that will improve operating speed and costs in the foundry.

The results indicate that the NACA0015 aerofoil produces lower drag, making it more suitable for rapid acceleration.

80,Doi: 10.46254/Af06.20250181,"in the current global economy, increasing efficiency and profitability requires supply chain optimization. this article examines overall equipment effectiveness (oee) as a crucial instrument in supply chain management (scm). oee, derived from total productive maintenance (tpm), assesses equipment availability, performance, and quality, thereby enhancing operational efficiency. the study emphasizes that the integration of oee with contemporary scm approaches may result in substantial improvements in productivity, cost efficiency, and responsiveness. the literature study delineates the progression of supply chain management (scm) from its emergence in the 1980s, highlighting the increasing intricacy of supply networks attributable to globalization and technology innovations. the text examines many solutions for supply chain optimization, including inventory management and demand forecasting, augmented by advancements like artificial intelligence and huge data. the adaptability of oee across many sectors is analysed, highlighting its use in areas like mining, transportation, and urban freight. the study highlights oee's shortcomings as a stand-alone measure despite its extensive usage and explores how different sectors have customized it to fit certain operational requirements. the study's ultimate goal is to show that efficient use of oee not only improves supply chain operations but also synchronizes operational and sustainability goals, making it an essential element for businesses looking to succeed in a cutthroat market.",optimization,"The overall equipment effectiveness (OEE) statistic is an important indicator for corporate decision-making across a wide range of sectors. It evaluates the efficiency of manufacturing equipment, materials and financial assets. Logistics use it to examine environmental implications such as carbon footprints, and supply chains can use it to review cargo handling equipment. Both of these applications are possible. When it comes to the service industry, OEE is able to quantify the level of client satisfaction with the availability, performance, and quality of services. It is possible to illustrate an organization's total productivity by including an OEE-based model into a balanced scorecard. According to the findings of the study, overall equipment effectiveness (OEE) considerably improves plant performance by raising performance by 15%, increasing production capacity by 20%, lowering downtime by 30%, and decreasing scrap and rework rates, which ultimately results in a 10% decrease in energy consumption. Inventory optimization is undergoing a transformation as a result of the rise of big data, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. Additionally, approaches such as demand forecasting and real-time inventory monitoring are being improved. OEE has grown to encompass lean manufacturing and supply chain efficiency, and its integration with technology belonging to Industry 4.0 allows real-time performance monitoring and fits with the objectives of smart manufacturing and logistics. Through the use of data-driven insights, the objective of the link between OEE and supply chain performance is to minimize interruptions, decrease costs, and increase delivery accuracy.

82,Doi: 10.46254/Af06.20250199,"this paper examines how project management techniques can be utilised as strategic tools to enhance infrastructure projects more efficiently and effectively. it refers mainly to the zama water treatment project in south africa. this research illustrates the efficacy of pert (program evaluation and review technique), cpm (critical path method), and project crashing in resolving the region's water quality and infrastructure problems. the primary objective is to optimise the zama water treatment project's planning, monitoring, and control to ensure project success. information was collected from hydro novo ltd in collaboration with the municipal chairperson of utility services. the data provided in the tables facilitated the development of the project management model following the fundamental principles of these approaches. the model was solved with the assistance of qm for windows. the solution revealed that the project duration could be reduced from 78,6 weeks (completion time) to 57 weeks, costing r6,212,500 additional. by crashing the project, the municipality ensures a quicker resolution to the water quality issues, significantly improving the social, economic, and quality of life conditions in the zama community and supporting the stability and growth of local businesses. the sensitivity analysis suggests that reducing the project duration to 65 or 60 weeks can be viable. it would save a lot of time at an acceptable cost and minimise risks while providing substantial benefits to the community. furthermore, the study demonstrates how project management tools can enhance the success of infrastructure projects in resource-limited areas, ultimately contributing to sustainable water management in south africa. key words project management, pert (program evaluation and review technique), cpm (critical path method), project crashing, water treatment 1. introduction people in zama, south africa, continue to fight for access to clean and safe water (njilo 2024). despite numerous interventions that have been made to address the issue, water quality in the region continues to fall below acceptable health standards, compromising public health and social well-being (infrastructure news 2025). this predicament is worsened by outdated infrastructure, constrained resources and difficulty implementing effective project management (sanews 2024). historically, poor project management has significantly contributed to infrastructure failures,",,"The Zama water treatment project is a good example of applying project management tools to overcome challenging infrastructure issues. Using PERT, CPM, and project crashing, the project team determined the critical activities, improved resource utilisation, and shortened the project duration from 78,6 weeks to 57 weeks at an extra cost of R6 212500. This method guarantees a timely supply of clean water to the Zama community and acts as a model for other communities facing similar challenges. Applying these methods proves that they can potentially make infrastructure work more efficiently. Finally, it advances people's quality of life and public health. Lesson Learned The Zama water treatment project highlights several key lessons. The project duration was reduced by implementing project management techniques from 78.6 weeks to 57 weeks, confirming that the methods can manage resources effectively. While reducing project duration, balancing time savings with cost implications is essential. The additional cost of R 6 212500 for crashing activities was justified by the significant reduction in project time, highlighting the need for careful cost-benefit analysis.Effective coordination with all the stakeholders involved, including the Municipal Chairperson of Utilities Services and the project company, was crucial in gathering accurate data and ensuring smooth project implementation. Successful stakeholder collaboration and communication were fundamental in overcoming logistical, financial, and operational challenges (Pinha & Ahluwalia 2018). The project faced different challenges, from approval bottlenecks to limited resources. However, navigating through these challenges using project management tools enabled efficient utilisation of project resources, including time for the project's success. In addition, the project helps realise the overall objective of sustainable water management in South Africa. In solving the recurring issue of water quality in Zama, the project can be a model for similar communities facing the same problem. Ensuring the availability of safe and clean water is a considerable contribution to the public's health and the well-being of society. The project's success in providing clean water to the Zama community highlights the importance of infrastructure projects in improving the quality of life for residents.","zama water treatment project: optimisation using project management techniques mmasefako lucy tlala department of quality and operations management faculty of engineering and the built environment, university of johannesburg johannesburg, south africa lucymmasefako@gmail.com eveth nkeiruka nwobodo-anyadiegwu department of quality and operations management faculty of engineering and built environment, university of johannesburg johannesburg, south africa evethn@uj.ac.za","References

Evidently, with more operational constraints and decision variables, an optimal production mix can be obtained at any time by applying the techniques used in this study. By optimising delivery resource allocation through the LP model, SA Petro can maximise profits while meeting operational constraints. The solutions produced by QM for Windows software indicate that SA Petro should deliver 150 000 litres via trucks, 120 000 litres by train and 730 000 litres through the pipelines. This will result in a profit of R555 000 for the month of December 2024. These results underscore the potential of LP to drive strategic decision-making in resource-constrained environments. Using such tools, SMMEs can improve their operational efficiency and secure long-term sustainability.","optimising resource allocation in smmes: a linear programming approach for sa petro zeniphile tebogo gumede department of quality and operations management faculty of engineering and the built environment, university of johannesburg johannesburg, south africa zeniphile2@gmail.com eveth nkeiruka nwobodo-anyadiegwu department of quality and operations management faculty of engineering and built environment, university of johannesburg johannesburg, south africa evethn@uj.ac.za","References

85,Doi: 10.46254/Af06.20250202,"this paper investigates score-based and constraint-based causal discovery methods, emphasizing their application to manufacturing processes. the research focuses on how algorithms such as the pc (peter and clark) and fges (fast greedy equivalence search) can uncover causal relationships within complex manufacturing systems, which are essential for process optimization, fault detection, and informed decision-making.the study was done in three key phases. first, a thorough literature review established the theoretical foundation for understanding causal discovery methods. these methods were applied to real-world manufacturing data in the second phase, focusing on assembly lines and production processes. the main goal was to find key variables impacting production efficiency, product quality, and equipment failure rates. in the final phase, the performance of the causal discovery algorithms was evaluated through regression analyses, where r-squared values measured how well the identified causal relationships explained observed outcomes. the results revealed that the pc algorithm can identify direct and indirect relationships among variables. also, the fges algorithm proved more effective at uncovering complex interactions in high- dimensional datasets.this study suggests that causal discovery techniques can be integrated into automated decision- support systems within manufacturing. organizations can refine existing systems, optimize operations, and develop predictive models for proactive issue management by better understanding the causal structure of production processes. future research should expand the application of causal discovery methods across a broader range of manufacturing environments.",causal discovery,"In conclusion, this study highlights the potential of score-based (FGES) and constraint-based (PC) causal discovery algorithms in uncovering causal relationships within manufacturing processes, a tool not widely recognized in this domain. The research demonstrated that these algorithms could effectively identify the causal structure between variables, ultimately improving the understanding of key dependencies that drive production efficiency, product quality, and equipment failure rates. By evaluating and comparing the effectiveness of the PC and FGES algorithms, this work contributes to determining the best-suited approach for modeling complex, high-dimensional datasets typical of manufacturing environments. These findings suggest that causal discovery can enhance decision-making in industrial systems by providing clearer insights into how different factors influence outcomes, enabling more accurate predictions and proactive fault detection. The application of causal discovery models, particularly those based on the PC and FGES algorithms, opens up new opportunities for refining manufacturing operations. While previous studies have not explored the use of these models to estimate heterogeneous causal effects in manufacturing, this research fills that gap and offers a foundational framework for future investigations. By demonstrating the potential for causal analysis in industrial settings, the study advocates for the integration of causal discovery techniques into automated decision-support systems. This integration can optimize operations, improve predictive modeling, and help organizations better manage issues before they escalate. Looking ahead, further research can expand the application of these methods across various manufacturing sectors, providing deeper insights into process improvements and advancing data-driven decision-making.","exploring causal discovery in manufacturing: techniques and applications aishwary pawar university decision support southern methodist university dallas, tx 75205, usa aishwaryp@smu.edu",

Freight transport remains essential for economic growth, business development, and improving quality of life, but it is also a major contributor to CO₂ emissions. While railways offer more cost-effective logistics options, road transport continues to dominate both freight and passenger movement, leading to higher expenses and environmental concerns. Introducing green hydrogen into India’s logistics sector could bring a range of benefits, including environmental improvements, economic growth, and positive social impacts. Green hydrogen has the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and lower dependence on imported fossil fuels, while also supporting India’s broader goals of reducing logistics costs to 5% of GDP and achieving some Sustainable Development Goals, as well as net-zero emissions by 2070.

The research investigates how varying the number of robots and stations affects performance efficiency under three different CT: EN priority ratios: 1:0 (cycle time prioritization), 0.5:0.5 (balanced optimization), and 0:1 (energy prioritization). A mathematical model was developed to simulate and optimize task allocation under these conditions, ensuring a trade-off between productivity and sustainability. The experimental design involved varying the number of robots (1 to 12) and stations (3 to 12), while conducting simulations to measure cycle time and energy consumption across different configurations. The results show that the optimization of robotic assembly lines is a delicate balancing act. While increasing resources improves performance, diminishing returns and energy trade-offs necessitate context-aware strategies. Stations mitigate sequential bottlenecks but risk inefficiency if overused. Larger problems necessitate proportional scaling of both resources to avoid performance collapse. Problem Size Dictates Optimization Strategy such that for small tasks (11–25 tasks) prioritize simplicity, as minimal robots/stations suffice, while for large tasks (35+ tasks) demand aggressive resource allocation to balance CT and EN. Finally, the optimization of robotic assembly lines is a delicate balancing act. While increasing resources improves performance, diminishing returns and energy trade-offs necessitate context-aware strategies. For large-scale systems, a hybrid approach—leveraging parallelization for CT reduction while monitoring energy thresholds offers the most sustainable path forward. By aligning resource allocation with operational priorities, manufacturers can achieve both efficiency and sustainability in an era of increasingly complex automation.From ANOVA analysis, it is found that robots have a strong impact on efficiency, as shown by both ANOVA and box plots. Stations do not significantly affect the WEST ratio, meaning adding more stations does not necessarily improve efficiency. The interaction effect (Robots × Stations) is insignificant, meaning these two factors work independently rather than together. 8.

The comparative analysis of three scenarios demonstrates that smart technology integration can lead to notable enhancements in either operational efficiency (as seen in Scenario 2) or value recovery (as seen in Scenario 3), both contributing to increased net gains compared to the baseline scenario. These findings suggest that smart technologies—such as IoT-enabled tracking, automated sorting systems, and data-driven decision support—can serve as powerful enablers for more sustainable and cost-effective reverse logistics systems.However, several limitations must be acknowledged. First, the scenarios are based on simulated or case-specific data, which may not fully capture the complexity and variability of real-world supply chains. Second, the study focuses primarily on quantitative indicators (time, cost, recovered value, net gain) and does not explore qualitative impacts such as customer satisfaction, employee adaptability, or environmental benefits. Third, the adoption of smart technologies often requires significant upfront investment and organizational change, factors that were not fully integrated into the evaluation model. Future research should aim to validate these findings through empirical case studies across diverse industries and geographical contexts. Additionally, expanding the analysis to include social and environmental performance indicators, as well as long-term return on investment, would provide a more holistic understanding of the role smart technologies play in shaping next-generation reverse logistics systems.

104,Doi: 10.46254/Af06.20250222,"in this study, we analyzed the neural phenomenon of decision-making from the perspective of cognitive modes. the main purpose of this study is to investigate the detectability of human decisions from brain signals by a computerized program. we delved into the neural signals to understand the brain functions of the cognitive modes in a binary decision-making context. the decision-making process is based on two different cognitive modes, which are intuitive and analytic. as they are opposite and conflicting by definition and characteristics, we aim to find out whether the mode significantly affects the detectability of the decision. we introduced time limitation vs. adequate time, unclear knowledge vs. clear knowledge, and absence of information during decision-making vs. the availability of information to create an intuitive cognitive mode and analytic mode, respectively. we used a modified artificial grammar learning (agl) design combined with a yes/no binary context to create a binary decision-making event. we collected the brain signal during the decision-making using the noninvasive electroencephalography (eeg) technique. for the investigation of the detectability of the decision, we used the supervised machine learning technique for classification analysis. we achieved 95% average accuracy in analytic mode and 93% accuracy in intuitive mode. with the aim of efficient design, we also identified the top 5 channels for each mode, which can provide up to 80% average accuracy for detecting decisions. this study also suggests that the best machine learning algorithms for this purpose are the knn (k-nearest neighbor) and rf (random forest) classifiers.","decision-making, cognitive mode","scientifically, much more observation on a more diverse population is needed. Thirdly, to address the efficiency factor, we totally bypassed the pre-processing steps; in several previous studies, it has been established that normalization can improve the performance of the machine learning models (Firoz et al. 2022, 2023, 2024); in future studies, different levels of cleansing and pre-processing can be done to understand their effect on the model performance. Fourth, this study was designed with one kind of decision-making, based on AGL; to conclude or understand overall cognitive mode aspects, different kinds of study can be conducted and compared. Fifth, as a preliminary study, this study addressed a binary decision-making process, where, decision-making is such a complex process that in most cases it has more outcomes/choices rather than just two. Despite these limitations, this preliminary study offers a new look to improve human-machine teaming using human’s own assets (i.e. neural signals) and technological advancement of computers, and future studies. 5.4 Validation From the above observations, we can see that our four research questions have been addressed adequately at the preliminary level and further studies can be conducted based on these findings to learn more about these matters. The first research question, where we wanted to understand whether the yes/no decision can be detected by a machine learning model, is answered as 94%-96% accuracy can be achieved with 30 channels. We can also see that the model’s performance is being affected at least at some level, by the mode of cognition. From the perspective of design efficiency, we presented the trend of decreasing performance when the number of channels is decreased. Also, this performance is achieved with completely raw data.","a study of detecting human decision by interpreting neural signal via electroencephalography (eeg) and machine learning in a (yes/no) paradigm kazi farzana firoz school of computing, applied science, & engineering carolina university winston-salem, nc 27101, usa firozk@carolinau.edu younho seong department of industrial and systems engineering north carolina agricultural and technical state university greensboro, nc 27411, usa yseong@ncat.edu","References

The novel framework addresses the critical challenges including data security, traceability and operational inefficiency. Our current research phase is devoted to refining the design in order to ensure its scalability and adaptability across various supply chain ecosystems. As the system is actually in the design phase, future studies will focus on its practical applications in real supply chain scenarios. This should include testing the framework to approve its effectiveness and determining areas of optimization. Moreover, our ongoing work includes rigorous testing to assess its performance under a variety of operational conditions. By providing insights into the practical implementation and outcomes, future research will contribute to the advancement of BCT-enabled supply chain systems.

107,Doi: 10.46254/Af06.20250235,"this paper presents an original multi-objective optimization model for increasing the generation capacity of renewable technologies under stochastic power outages and load shedding. the model aims to minimize the total costs of capital, and operations and maintenance (o&m), while maximizing the number of total annual jobs created in the manufacturing, installation, and operation phases of the renewable energy sources (res). the model focuses on wind, solar photovoltaic (pv), and concentrated solar power (csp) technologies predominantly used in south africa. lithium-ion batteries are used as a storage system to stockpile energy for the anticipation of load shedding. two intervention methods, expected value approach (eva) and scenario chance constrained programming (sccp), are applied to derive the deterministic equivalents of the stochastic constraints. a preemptive optimization approach is used to reduce the multi-objective model to single-objective solutions. the coefficient of variation is then used to compare the variation of the renewable generation from the two methods to the profile of the historical generation. the sccp has a lower percentage error of variation than the eva, thus validating its application when precision is critical. a sensitivity analysis is performed by varying the minimum required contribution parameter, which shows an upward trend in the total costs and annual jobs mainly influenced by increasing the capacity of csp and pv respectively. the study uses a novel model to estimate renewable generation required to offset generation deficit, thus illustrating that increasing the nominal capacities of the res in south africa can mitigate the crisis of power outages.","optimization, uncertainty, job opportunities","Operations research is an important area of research for modeling uncertainties in energy systems. This paper formulated a mixed integer non-linear stochastic multi-objective model to minimize the total costs of capital, fixed and variable O&M, and maximize the number of job opportunities. The uncertainties in RES and unplanned power outages were approximated with their expected values using EVA, and scenarios using SCCP. The EVA yielded lower total costs and job opportunities than the SCCP approach. However, validating EVA and SCCP RES generation against the historical generation showed that the SCCP method approximated the uncertainty better than the EVA. This is important for decision-makers since the correct generation characteristic will ensure a reliable and stable grid when integrating RES. Despite this, the EVA method can be considered in instances with financial limitations. If budget is a concern, decision-makers can use the EVA recommendations, but if a stable grid is more important, the SCCP recommendations should be used. Sensitivity analysis revealed that there is an existing direct proportional relationship between the objectives, the nominal capacities, and the amount of energy generated. The model can be improved by adding an annual budget as a constraint, thus having an expansion plan spanning several years/ periods. This is quite realistic since the overnight expansion of RES is impracticable for a developing country.","multi-objective optimization model for renewable energy technologies under uncertainty: a south african case robert gumba and wilna l. bean department of industrial and systems engineering university of pretoria private bag x20, hatfield 0028, south africa robert.gumba@tuks.co.za, wilna.bean@up.ac.za",

(birinci 2018) states that peer-to-peer accommodations have become a popular alternative option to traditional hotels like hotel x and has caused commotion in the hospitality industry in the past few years. (dolnicar 2018) states that airbnb has changed how people think about accommodation through its sharing economy business model, affordable pricing and consumer experience which challenge traditional hotel’s position in the market. problem statement the emergence of peer-to-peer accommodation platforms like airbnb have brought significant competition to hotel x. these peer-to-peer platforms offer consumers cost effective, personalized and unique accommodation options that appeal to a large segment of consumers. this has resulted in hotel x facing problems in maintaining a market share and profitability which has led to challenges in changing pricing strategies and meeting consumer needs.",,"than any other research methods. The researcher used a combination of open ended and closed questions in their interviews with the employees at Hotel X so as to gather thorough data while making sure that the important topics were covered. The researcher will also use Questionnaires as a tool to get information from Hotel X’s potential guests. According to (Rowley 2014) questionnaires serve as tools for acquiring and documenting data on important topics for a specific study. Questionnaires can be structured with open ended questions, close ended questions or both and they are helpful when gathering data from many people in an efficient and systematic way (Cohen 2017) states. The researcher chose questionnaires because their format of standardization makes sure that all participants answer the same questions in the same way which comes handy in differentiating responses. The researcher distributed the questionnaire form through social media and email so as to reach the right audience. 4.Data Analysis and Interpretation The data gathered from the qualitative interviews will be analyzed using thematic analysis, which was developed by (Terry et al. 2006), this analysis involves the following steps: Familiarizing yourself with the data, going through the data to identify any interesting features and assigning codes, Evaluate the codes to find important patterns, Examine the patterns and compare them with the original data, Define and name the patterns and Interstate the patterns into coherent answers and write a report. 5.Results And Discussion Market Share Figure 1.

123,Doi: 10.46254/Af06.20250254,"airport operations are becoming increasingly complex due to rapid technological advancements and the growing demand for air travel. this complexity necessitates airports to manage their assets optimally, and one of the critical assets is contact gates. inefficient gate assignments can lead to significant disruptions, including passenger discomfort passengers, flight delays, and challenges for airlines in maintaining flight schedules. to address these issues, this study introduces an optimization model aimed at improving gate assignments while considering the maintenance status of pre-conditioned air (pca) systems. the model focuses on assigning gates based on their pca status to reduce the wear effect on equipment and ensure adequate maintenance scheduling. a case study at king abdulaziz international airport (kaia) was applied to over 800 flights and 76 gates to verify the effectiveness of the model. the results demonstrated improvements in contact gate utilization, with all flights assigned to contact gates. furthermore, more than 45.6% of flights were assigned to gates with good pca status, although only 17.4% of gates were in good condition. to further analyze the model, the flights of an airline representing 47.8% of kaia’s flights were benchmarked with their baseline assignment, and the results showed a 3% increase in contact gate assignment. additionally, since gates with poor pca status require an air conditioning unit (acu) rental at an additional cost, optimizing the assignment to prioritize gates with good pca status significantly reduced the acu rental costs by 94.03%.",,,"enhancing customer experience at king abdulaziz international airport (kaia) by optimizing the gate assignment process shefaa baik assistant professor, department of industrial engineering faculty of engineering, king abdulaziz university jeddah 21589, saudi arabia sbaik@kau.edu.sa renad bardwana, joud aswnib, lamar aljalsic senior industrial engineering students, department of industrial engineering faculty of engineering, king abdulaziz university jeddah 21589, saudi arabia arenadbardwan@gmail.com, bjoudaswni@gmail.com , clamaraljalsi1@gmail.com",
