0,Informed Decision Making On Prediction Of Spare Parts  Requirements Based-On Machine Learning Approach,"pt xyz is one of a big company in indonesia. in daily operations, pt xyz performs many business processes, one of which is the procurement process. this process requires a prediction of the need for goods for the procurement process to be carried out because intermittent and lumpy characteristics. this is the background for conducting this research. this study aims to predict the level of demand for goods so that it can help the procurement department to make purchases of goods. the method used is k-means for clustering, holt winter for forecasting, and association rule to find out the combination of items that are often held. the clustering process produces 3 clusters, namely the first cluster which has members of 327 items with an average value of 68, the second cluster which has members of 18 items with an average value of 1281, and the third cluster which has members of 5 items with an average value of 2474. the resulting forecast covers the upcoming 3 months period with a value of 427 in january, 472 in february, and 476 in march. in addition, it is also known which items are likely to appear in that month using the probability method and the minimum value of the probability is 50%. in january there are 10 items that are possible to appear, 22 items in february, and 20 items in march. the rules generated from the association rule process are 24 rules. the rule is generated with a minimum support value of 10% and a minimum confidence of 50%. the integration between methods is also carried out to cover the existing deficiencies, so that more accurate results are obtained.","prediction, k-means, holt winter, association rule, integration","Maintaining inventory levels of the required spare parts is important in running the company's operations. If this inventory level is not maintained and suffers from a shortage, it will result in the cessation of the operation process because machine repair cannot be carried out. One way that can be done to maintain this level of inventory is to predict the need for existing spare parts. On the other hand, this prediction process has its own challenges, such as the lumpy and intermittent nature of spare parts requirements. Both properties will complicate the prediction process because the data on the level of demand becomes very volatile and can be erratic. These problems can be overcome by the results 14","abdul rahman rizki wijaya department of industrial engineering universitas islam indonesia jl. kaliurang km 14.4, sleman, yogyakarta, indonesia winda nur cahyo department of industrial engineering universitas islam indonesia jl. kaliurang km 14.4, sleman, yogyakarta, indonesia winda.nurcahyo@uii.ac.id","References

1,The Management Of Change And Organizational Culture  Within The Media Industry In South Africa,"the target of this examination is to break down the impacts of hierarchical culture on management of change practice in the south african media industry as the nation is situating itself to grasp the fourth industrial revolution (4ir). led through a cross-sectional study of the media houses in south africa, this research collected data both qualitative and quantitative in nature. questionnaires were distributed to a total of 60 managers in the south african media space, with a response rate of 90%. the examination confirmed that change is a procedure driven by a few vital contemplations, which include the need for progressively harmonized techniques for conducting work and the improvement of business execution. these contemplations regularly are the outcome in organized change issues, dependent on the supposition that the management of change involves a compelled course of action of conciliation that can be recognized in a for the most part limited timeframe. practically, the ramification of this investigation is to guarantee that firms basically assess all the significant factors and by expansion in this way include all the applicable partners for a progressively effective change management procedure in the present period of the 4ir.","change, change management","and Recommendation To effectively accomplish change, it is compulsory that the company’s executives should conduct an audit of the current company culture. This will put the different perspectives under investigation to assess their significance and commitment to planning and actualizing the change venture and the essential changes required. Stream of data starting with one level then onto the next is postponed should there be numerous levels within the organization’s hierarchy. Therefore, it is imperative to decrease of the levels, which will add to effective communication. The research infers that for any viable change, there should be hierarchical and social alterations that should be made to oblige and continue change. This implies change is fruitful when it gets systematized and almost things are done in an organization which as a result implies the organization culture should change. The research has prompted the conclusions that various parts of progress have structure or limits. The human and hierarchical limits cannot be isolated from the processes within the organization’s framework. The way that social associations are invented by individuals proposes that they can be set up for an endless assortment of objectives. Various circumstances call for various responses henceforth the utilization of proactive, expectant and receptive managerial styles to suit the diverse kind of cultures. The study reasons that basic to effective change is great planning. Effectively dealing with the multifaceted nature of change is for all intents and purposes outlandish without a vigorous plan that is bolstered by a solid project management team. Evaluation of accessible resources and their capacity to deal with the change procedure is indispensable. According to Burns and Stalker (2014) who contended that, businesses frequently consider it to be a challenging task to conform to change; therefore, one executive's duties of first importance is to create an organization’s environment to address the difficulty of things to come. The duty is practiced by evaluating the assets and opportunities which are openly accessible, defining and characterizing the objectives of the business and productively dealing with the resources assigned to meet these objectives. The compelling procedure to arrive at explicit objectives and targets starts to create administrative planning systems so as to in the long run produce a powerful organization. Planning includes features of critical thinking, identification of problems, anticipations of problems and in particular basic leadership (Lynch, 2005). The study likewise infers that change is a procedure driven by a few vital contemplations including the requirement for increasingly incorporated methods for working and the need to improve business execution. Askim et al. (2009) noticed that the management of change is foundational and ought to be deployed with sensible reasons and all stakeholders’ participation in the change venture. These contemplations commonly are the outcome in organized change programs dependent on the suspicion that the management of change comprises of a constrained set of intercessions, which are viewed as target, quantifiable and directly reasonable projects that can be acknowledged in a generally brief time. The study prescribes that before the initiation of any change management procedure, comprehension of the powers driving change ought to be acknowledged as it will lead a change supervisory group to a more profound comprehension of the setting of change, arrangement of objectives with the main thrusts, and the management of these powers all through the change procedure. The investigation further prescribes a cautious evaluation of the accessible assets, their skill to deal with the change procedure and above all, kind of organisation culture the company right now works in. Hierarchical culture is a significant deciding variable of how any association grasps change.","sambil charles mukwakungu, portia makamu, nita sukdeo and charles mbohwa department of quality and operations management university of johannesburg johannesburg, south africa sambilm@uj.ac.za, portiamakamu79@gmail.com, nsukdeo@uj.ac.za, cmbohwa@uj.ac.za",

3,Pattern Mapping For Cancer Prescription Process:   A Case Of Healthcare Operations In Government,"this study identifies prescription variety in patients diagnosed with cancer in regional part of thailand by mapping pattern of prescription diversities from health administrated guidelines. this study examines prescribing variability in patients diagnosed with cancer symptoms by mapping prescribing patterns from electronic medical records to understand the impact of prescribing differences on patients. this research showed how big data technology and cloud computing can be integrated and put into practice to meaningfully support the migration of data from local hospital databases to cloud databases. this proposal focuses on optimizing respective software performance and funding in actual cloud service deployments. this study can confirm that health services program decisions in the management of chronic diseases are influenced despite the prescribing guidelines provided. the lack of coordination of care has been cited as one cause of waste and inefficiency, especially when tests and services are repeated because their results are not communicated between providers. for cancer treatments, more than 1,000 preferred brand names and generic brands to treat chronic conditions are available in the market. the list is extended triple for non-preferred drugs which incurs researchers to define pattern of choices to prevent over-prescriptions and overdiagnosis. most importantly, cost and profit made in compliance with drug choice may be made specific guidelines of health administered programs. a conjuncture is also given to researchers on how guidelines designate orders for prescriptions on multiple benefit plans. this study acquired data mining techniques to identify prescription patterns in health administered programs, and to clarify whether health insurance and benefit plans play role in changing the decision of drug choices. the results from this study suggest that ignorance of guidelines occurred more frequently in universal coverage scheme, however, physicians tend to override the prescription guideline for cancer and hypertension patients who enrolled in government benefit program. this study is able to support the notion that health administered programs may play role in determining drug options due to criteria in quality of treatment.",,,"administration in thailand praowpan tansitpong assistant professor nida business school national institute of development administration (nida), thailand praowpan.tan@nida.ac.th",
4,Factors Influencing Eco-Innovation In Halal Food Smes  In Malaysia: A Study From An Islamic Perspective,"halal food smes play a significant role in malaysia's economic development, as the halal food industry is a major contributor to the country's gdp and employment. however, the industry faces a challenge in meeting the growing demand for eco-innovation while also complying with government regulations. this study aimed to investigate the implementation of eco-innovation practices among smes in the malaysian food industry. the study included four independent variables: technological, organizational, environmental, and individual factors, to measure their relationship towards eco-innovation performance. a questionnaire was used to collect data from 150 employees in the food sme sector who implemented eco-innovation practices. the study's findings revealed that technological, organizational, environmental, and individual factors have a significant positive relationship with eco-innovation in malaysian food industry smes. this study contributes to the literature by providing new insights into how teleology ethics guide muslims to consume halal food purposefully, intentionally, mindfully, compassionately, and conscientiously. furthermore, it enhances the knowledge on eco-innovation practices among smes in the malaysian food industry, which has been lacking in research. however, this study has some limitations. firstly, the study only focused on the malaysian halal food industry, which limits the generalization of the findings to other industries or countries. secondly, the sample size was relatively small, and the data was collected from a single source. therefore, future research should consider a larger sample size from multiple sources to improve the generalizability of the findings. additionally, future studies could explore the impact of different eco-innovation practices on the performance of smes in the halal food industry.","eco-innovation, halal, food, muslims, smes","6.1 Implication of the research The halal food industry in Malaysia is an emerging sector that requires a focus on environmental sustainability. Eco-innovation is critical to achieving this goal, and understanding the factors that significantly influence it can help improve the industry's environmental performance. This study contributes to the literature on eco-innovation by examining the individual, environmental, and organizational factors that significantly influence eco-innovation in the halal food industry in Malaysia. Firstly, individual factors such as personal values, environmental awareness, and willingness to innovate significantly influence eco-innovation in the halal food industry. Employees who are environmentally conscious and willing to adopt eco-friendly practices can positively impact the industry's overall eco-innovation performance. Secondly, environmental factors such as government support, environmental regulations, and stakeholder pressure are critical to the implementation of eco-innovation practices in the halal food industry. The Malaysian government has shown support for environmental sustainability initiatives, and stakeholders are increasingly pushing for eco-friendly practices in the industry.

5,Studying And Troubleshooting Lubricity Test On Pressure  Guidewire Proximal And Distal Coatings,"coatings of guidewires used in medical device manufacturing industry are one of the most important aspects. it defines its efficiency to penetrate through tightest of canals and curves. guidewires are put through controlled environment to accelerate its age and tested for its mechanical features. pressure guidewire failed the lubricity testing after being tested by multiple operators and at alternate sites. a cause-and-effect diagram shows all potential causes of test failure. the human factor involved in the test failure was investigated through multiple gage r&r and training records. calibration error with the lubricity tester dl1000 was identified and solved through preventive maintenance work order. the failed samples were examined under scanning electron microscope and detailed images showed coating wearing off from t=2years samples. a two-factor design of experiment factorial was conducted to see the effects of factors on distal and proximal sections of the wire. the actual setting of corona distance 5mm and dip speed 60mm/min seem to affect the coating of proximal section during aging process. a new optimize setting of corona distance 2mm and dip speed of 30mm/min proved to provide better coating that can sustain the wire over the 2 years. similarly, for distal section of pressure guidewire, uv intensity of 6.0 and corona time of 30seconds showed better results as compared to original setting. a confirmation study was conducted to prove the effects of new changes implementation and process capability showed that the results were under control.","guidewire, gage r&r, lubricity","This study provided detailed analysis on different factors that contributed the lubricity testing failure. The measurement system, human factor, and machine, all contributed to testing failure to a certain extent and the variance was calculated using DOE. Coating of Pressure Guidewire was the leading factor, as proved both through DOE and SEM images. This study helped essentially in fixing the coatings processes of guidewire and make the product more sustainable over the time.","kuldeep agarwal and usama a. khan department of automotive and manufacturing engineering technology minnesota state university mankato mankato, mn 56001, usa kuldeep.agarwal@mnsu.edu, usamaabdullah.khan@mnsu.edu",
6,Reliability Of Sewerage Pipelines In South Africa  Themba B. Masingi,"water is required for the optimal operation of sewerage pipelines, water treatment and wastewater treatment facilities. in the absence of water, it is impossible to achieve adequate sanitation. the provision of water and sanitation services is acknowledged as a human right for all, both for destitute and affluent individuals. as a developing country, south africa is experiencing rapid growth in its’ number of urban dwellers, and this rapid growth strains sewerage pipelines often leading to clogging, leakage, and deformation. the purpose of this paper is to investigate the factors that affect the reliability of sewerage pipelines and to identify reliability tools that can be employed at different stages of the pipeline lifecycle to enhance reliability. a deductive approach was adopted as the research methodology and a survey questionnaire was employed to obtain the research data from a select engineering population in south africa, with the test items deduced from a comprehensive literature review. the research population was comprehensive, and snowball sampling was utilized to obtain information. the following reliability tools are mostly utilized by industry in south africa to improve the reliability of sewerage pipelines, namely fault tree analysis, reliability-based maintenance, failure-mode-and-effect analysis, and hazard and operability studies.","sewerage pipelines, development","The research investigated the factors that affect the reliability of sewerage pipelines in South Africa, and identified and recommended reliability tools that can be employed at different stages of the pipeline lifecycle to enhance the reliability of the pipeline. The respondents suggest that design parameters, environmental factors (corrosion), fatigue, third party interference, buckling and leakage affect the reliability of sewer pipelines mostly. In general, welded failures result in leakages. The literature data in Figure 1 (Literature Review) is congruent to the current research results, the data in Figure 1 indicate that welded failures (leakage), corrosion and excavation damage (third party interference) are the largest causes of pipeline failures each contributing 34%, 18% and 15% respectively. Hence, the industry results reflect and support the findings from literature from a South African perspective. According to the research findings, four reliability tools emerged as the most implemented or utilized in the industry, namely HAZOP, FTA, FMEA and RBM. As such, more focus on these reliability tools will yield the most favorable results in improving the reliability of sewerage pipelines, provided that implementation takes place at the correct stage of the sewer pipeline lifecycle.","postgraduate school of engineering management university of johannesburg johannesburg, south africa tbjmasingi@gmail.com hannelie nel postgraduate school of engineering management university of johannesburg johannesburg, south africa hnel@tennelli.com",
7,Do The Descriptions In The Md&A Section Contribute As A  Red Flag For The Early Detection Of Fraudulent Accounting,"accounting fraud is defined as the intentional material misstatement of financial statements or disclosures (in notes to financial statements or sec filings) or the commission of an illegal act that has a material direct effect on financial statements or financial disclosures. the early detection of accounting fraud is important because fraudulent activity reduces public confidence in capital markets and hinders economic development. therefore, studies have been conducted to develop accounting fraud detection models using quantitative data, such as accounting and financial information, and qualitative data, such as descriptions of securities filings. previous studies using form 10-k extracted words that were highly associated with fraudulent accounting activities and used an svm (support vector machine) to construct a fraudulent accounting detection model. to build the model, fraudulent and non-fraudulent accounting firms were used as samples. by contrast, this study constructs a fraudulent accounting detection model that samples fraudulent accounting periods and other periods (non-fraudulent terms) of companies with fraudulent accounting experience and extracts words that capture the signs of fraudulent accounting. a fraudulent accounting detection model is constructed following the procedures of previous studies on companies listed on the tokyo stock exchange from 2004 to 2017. in addition, we constructed detection models using several classification algorithms (svm, rf, lr, and xgb) and compared their accuracies. the results show that svm is better at detecting accounting fraud than other classification algorithms, with a sensitivity (accuracy rate for accounting fraud firms) of 60%.","accounting fraud, svm, random forest",,"firms in japan? keisuke miyago, natsuki sato, ayuko komura and hirohisa hirai department of industrial engineering and management kanagawa university kanagawa, japan r202370170oe@jindai.jp, r202170129yo@jindai.jp, komura-a@kanagawa-u.ac.jp, hirai@kanagawa-u.ac.jp",
8,Relationship Between Textual Characteristics Of Md&A  Sections In English Annual Securities Reports Of Japanese,"the dearth of english information available to international investors for making investment decisions about japanese companies remains a persistent challenge. while previous studies have mainly focused on u.s.-listed companies, it has shown that the management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (md&a) section’s readability can negatively impact future performance, while its tone can positively influence it. given the divergent textual characteristics of u.s. and non-u.s. companies, it is unclear whether the relationship between readability/tone and future performance for u.s. firms applies to english-language annual securities reports of japanese companies. we examined the effect of tone and readability in the text on future performance (roe in t+1 period) by analyzing the md&a section of the english annual securities reports of japanese companies. it was observed that a higher tone of text in the md&a section and improved readability are associated with stronger future performance. this suggests that even in english annual securities reports, management may adapt the characteristics of the text in the md&a section based on future performance forecasts, similar to the reports in japanese.","md&a, readability, tone",,"companies and future roe ran murakami, takaaki kawabe, ayuko komura, and hirohisa hirai department of industrial engineering and management kanagawa university kanagawa, japan r202270170fe@jindai.jp, r202270101ag@jindai.jp, komura-a@kanagawa-u.ac.jp, hirai@kanagawa-u.ac.jp",
9,Do Male And Female Investors Use Different Information  When Assessing Stock Valuation And Trustworthiness?,"most listed japanese companies announce earnings forecasts based on their management (management forecasts). management forecasts are particularly important for investors' decision-making because they are published by managers who hold inside information. a previous study conducted an online experiment among japanese investors. investors looked at the information presented on the frequency of beating (versus missing) and earnings surprises and evaluated five items: a common stock valuation of the firm, the desirability of the firm, the future prospects of each firm, the competence of management, and trustworthiness. however, the previous study did not compare male and female investors. therefore, we compared male and female investors based on the data of a previous study. first, a comparison of the means between men and women showed that, overall, the means of male responses were higher. the analysis of variance showed that, in terms of stock evaluation, significant differences were obtained for males in the frequency of beating (f1,108 = 27.95, p=0.001) and earnings surprises (f1,104 = 6.07, p=0.015), so that both the number of achievements and earnings surprises were considered and evaluated. on the other hand, there were significant differences for females on the frequency of beating (f1,108 = 5.26, p=0.024), so it was clear that female investors evaluated them by looking at the number of achievements only. for trustworthiness, both male and female were evaluated based on the frequency of beating (male f1,108 = 31.41, p=0.001; female f1,108 = 8.04, p=0.005). therefore, for a company to be highly valued as a stock valuation by male investors, it is important to increase the number of achievements and earnings surprises, and in the case of female investors, the number of achievements. it is also important for firms to be rated highly reliable by both male and female investors.","management forecast, stock valuation, trustworthiness",,"kaori ojima, ayuko komura and hirohisa hirai department of industrial engineering and management kanagawa university kanagawa, japan r202370110qk@jindai.jp, komura-a@kanagawa-u.ac.jp, hirai@kanagawa-u.ac.jp",
10,The Relationship Between Managers Vocal Characteristics  In Net Conferences And Performance,"the impact of covid-19 has made it difficult to hold briefings on financial results and shareholder meetings in person. consequently, an increasing number of companies are using online conferences. in japan, there is an initiative called ""net conference"", which originated as a teleconference (conference call) to hold meetings such as financial results briefings over the internet. a net conference is a place for managers to present to stakeholders their company's performance and situation; however, it is also a place for communication between managers and participants. it serves as a platform for managers to communicate their company's performance and engage with stakeholders including shareholders, investors, and analysts. there are two types of communication in a net conference: verbal and nonverbal. nonverbal communication consists of visual information such as facial expressions, gestures, body language, and auditory information such as voice pitch and intensity.following the procedures of previous studies, this study focuses on the nonverbal communication of executives in japanese companies during net conferences, specifically examining vocal characteristics (voice pitch and volume). this study aims to elucidate the relationship between vocal characteristics and business performance.the analysis revealed that the fundamental frequency had a statistically significant negative coefficient （β = -.21, p < .05） on roe. the value of the partial regression coefficient for fundamental frequency is negative, indicating that managers with a lower voice have a higher roe.","voice pitch, voice volume, roe",,"hikaru kanda, takaaki kawabe, ayuko komura and hirohisa hirai department of industrial engineering and management kanagawa university kanagawa, japan r202270102ir@jindai.jp, r202270101ag@jindai.jp, komura-a@kanagawa-u.ac.jp, hirai@kanagawa-u.ac.jp",
11,Interaction Hierarchy To Sustainable Reverse Logistics  Activities In Indonesia,"many developed countries rely on reverse logistics (rl) to address the increasing amount of electronic waste that causes environmental pollution. unfortunately, many developing countries, including indonesia, struggle to develop rl activities. in indonesia, these activities actually cause severe environmental pollution through the inevitable informal business interactions involved. from the other side, governments in many developing countries admit that they still need informal businesses to help manage waste because of the limited number of government officials in office. therefore, it is necessary to study the form and hierarchy of informal business interactions for sustainable rl activities, so that decision makers can determine the waste management strategy to be implemented. this study uses a descriptive survey approach and applies the snowball sampling technique in collecting data from six provinces that are centers of e-waste processing in indonesia. awareness, interest, desire, and actions of stakeholders, including informal business and government, are measured separately because they cater to different interests. through the analysis, this research is expected to obtain a clear picture of the interaction level of each stakeholder in the implementation or support of sustainable reverse logistics activities. the results of the study show that informal business and government have a moderate level of awareness. they realize that rl activities can improve people's welfare and prevent environmental pollution, knowing that their business processes must strike a balance between economic development and public health. they are also aware of the risks that must be borne, in addition to the benefits they receive. however, interest and desire level of informal business to implement rl activities are low. conversely, governments have moderate interest and desire to support rl activities. although informal businesses have low interest in and desire to implement sustainable reverse logistics, they engage in real action such as providing e-waste bankers, creating a traditional machine to prevent direct interaction between employees and e-waste components, buying expensive technology to prevent air pollution, and willing to become freelancers for electronic manufacturers who are unable to treat e-waste in an environmentally friendly manner. in contrast, the government has a lower level of action in supporting rl activities. they do not have complete data about the existing iebs, as important messages about preventing environmental pollution due to illegal e-waste processing do not reach these groups. they admit that they have not built an srl governance system, provided facilities and technology, and implemented strict regulations and mechanisms due to the heavy workload from their main jobs.",aida,"Local government and environmental agencies in Indonesia have moderate awareness, interest, and desire to support sustainable reverse logistics. Conversely, even though informal businesses have moderate awareness, their interest in and desire to organize RL activities that are environmentally friendly and pay attention to the harmony of life are very low. Surprisingly the findings of this research show that low interest in and desire for IEBs to comply with environmental regulations does not prevent community members from trying to achieve environmental goals. To prevent a negative impact, they are willing to provide e-waste bankers, create traditional machines, buy expensive technology, and serve as freelancers for electronic manufacturers. Their main reason is to survive by conducting business that is dangerous but provides far greater profits than other informal businesses.","hesti maheswari, elliot simangunsong school of business and economics universitas prasetiya mulya tangerang-banten, indonesia hesti.maheswari@prasetiyamulya.ac.id; elliot@pmbs.ac.id",
12,Reducing Molding Sand Variation At A Job Shop Casting  Facility,"a job shop casting facility in southern minnesota utilizes the green sand molding process in the production of ductile iron castings. the foundry’s green sand is produced by mixing recycled molding sand with water, clay, seacoal, and other ingredients in a muller. maintaining consistent sand properties through the molding process is critical to the production of quality iron castings. one of the primary measured and controlled characteristics of which indicates molding sand quality is compactability. compactability is measured in-line automatically on every batch of sand; the results are used as the sole factor to determine water additions for the subsequent batch of sand. while this formula frequently produces sand that is sufficient for molding, various factors exist outside of this calculation that can affect the outcome of the next sand batch. these factors are currently not accounted for in the calculation of water additions and as such, some amount of inconsistency is generated by the current process. inconsistent molding sand may result in the production of scrap castings as well as downtime at the molding machines. this project utilizes the dmaic improvement process to reduce variation in molding sand by measuring, analyzing, and improving upon the parameters used in the green sand control process. the desired outcome of the project is to produce consistently stable sand by predicting and controlling water addition rate (therefore resulting compactability) based on the measured inputs. reducing batch-to-batch and overall variation in molding sand will lead to a reduction in sand-related scrap and downtime.","casting, variation, dmaic","5.1 Control As changes were implemented to the process, percent compactability and deviation from the setpoint were monitored and trended as the most immediate indicator of the success of the changes. This data is collected in real time on every batch of sand made and logged on to an internal server. The feedback is also utilized to determine water additions for the next batch of sand per the new adjustment chart in Table 3. Run charts are available to display data and deviation from the setpoint will trigger alarms and email alerts if there are more than three instances of the result being at least three points from the setpoint. An overview in Figure 9 shows the current typical spread of compactability, a drastic improvement from the compactability percent prior to the implementation of the aforementioned improvements. Figure 9. Spread of Compatibility after improvements Overall system stability was improved, and sand properties have continued to be more stable thanks to the improvements made to eliminate excess variation in the sand cooling and mulling processes. Accounting for the additional variations in incoming sand temperature and moisture have proven to stabilize the percent compactability of sand produced at the muller. Ongoing monitoring through X-bar and R charts as shown in Figure 10 allows us to further narrow down additional factors that can impact sand, some of which are discussed in the future improvements below. The ongoing use of alarms and email alerts has increased the awareness of sand properties among operators and maintenance technicians and allowed issues to be resolved before they lead to excessive downtime or scrap. 126","kuldeep agarwal and ashley folden-ecker department of automotive and manufacturing engineering technology minnesota state university mankato mankato, mn 56001, usa kuldeep.agarwal@mnsu.edu, ashly.folden-ecker@mnsu.edu","References

13,Production Model Based On Lean And Slp To Increase The  Level Of Service In A Peruvian Textile Sme,"the textile sector is one of the most important sectors in peru. currently, the peruvian market is highly competitive not only among domestic producers, but also with imports of textile products, which have been increasing progressively in recent years. therefore, for a textile manufacturing company to be competitive in the peruvian market, it must not only focus on offering the best price, but also a high level of service that allows it to differentiate itself from other competing companies. in this sense, the use of lean tools such as tpm and 5s integrated with slp is proposed to improve the service level of a textile sme. to support the effectiveness of the model and the improvement of the critical indicators, the model is validated through a pilot test and simulation. as a result of the application of the model, an increase of 25% in otif, 13% in overall equipment efficiency, 11% in production and reduction of 34.57% in search time were obtained.","5s methodology, tpm, slp, service level","The application of the 5S tool contributed to the reduction of search times from 7.58 min to 4 min, thus increasing the performance of each operator. Based on this indicator, we can conclude that the application of the 5S methodology contributes to improving the efficiency and performance of companies in the textile sector. The implementation of TPM greatly increased the efficiency of the equipment from 69.05% to 86.19%, which influences the availability of the machine, the efficiency, and the quality, which increased its production performance through the improvements implemented. The SLP technique reduced unnecessary transfers from one work area to another, making it possible to streamline the manufacturing process and reduce the operator’s effort. Finally, the use of the 3 tools together allowed to raise the level of service of the company that initially was 72% and applying the proposed improvement model increased to 97%.","jose emmanuel cusi-miranda and marlon frank aquino-julcarima facultad de ingeniería. universidad de lima, perú. 20173259@aloe.ulima.edu.pe, 20173038@aloe.ulima.edu.pe martin fidel collao-diaz research professor facultad de ingeniería. universidad de lima, perú. mcollao@ulima.edu.pe",
14,Monitoring Social Networks For Event Management:  Applicability Of Mewma For Parkrun,"social networks have become a powerful medium for communication and information sharing, influencing various aspects of society, including the organization and participation in community events such as parkrun. as the popularity of parkrun events continues to grow, effective monitoring and analysis of network data become crucial for event organizers to understand participant sentiments, engagement, and overall event success. in this paper, we propose the application of the multivariate exponentially weighted moving average (mewma) chart for social network monitoring of parkrun events, enabling the detection of anomalies and trends surrounding these events. implementing the proposed approach with uk parkrun events data and analyzing the change points highlights how tracking participants' choice of parkrun site for running can profoundly affect event coordination and enhance the participant experience. such analysis will assist planners in making more informed decisions regarding event logistics, resource allocation, and safety measures for parkrun events. this research demonstrates how monitoring methods can improve event management and enhance participant experiences through data-driven insights.",mewma,"Nowadays, the detection of change points in social networks has emerged as a focal point for researchers. Two primary approaches, model-based and free-model analysis, corresponding to parametric and nonparametric methods, have been extensively studied. While model-based methods have seen significant attention, only a limited number of studies have explored the use of Multivariate Profiles for monitoring network data generated from events. To bridge this gap, this paper highlights the applicability of the MEWMA chart for social network monitoring of Parkrun events, offering event organizers valuable insights to optimize their strategies and create engaging experiences for participants. We outline the potential benefits of using the MEWMA chart for event management, including its ability to facilitate data- driven decision-making, enhance event success, and improve participant experiences. Furthermore, we explore the broader applications of this monitoring technique for various other community events and social campaigns. The implications of this proposed tool extend across various industries, offering potential applications in gaining valuable business insights, conducting marketing analyses, monitoring criminal activities, and tracking the spread of diseases. As future research opportunities unfold, there are several areas for improvement in social network monitoring. The integration of natural language processing techniques for sentiment analysis, and the incorporation of more social media platforms, can significantly enrich the analysis. Additionally, investigating different types of changes can contribute to a better understanding of social network dynamics. Such endeavors have the potential to enhance the efficiency of monitoring techniques in various real-world scenarios.","arya karami and seyed taghi akhavan niaki department of industrial engineering sharif university of technology tehran, iran karami_ariya@ie.sharif.edu, niaki@sharif.edu",
15,National Policies Evaluation Of Sustainable Supply Chain Of  Automobile Industry Using Mcdm Models,"the sustainable transformation of the automobile industry's supply chain is a critical endeavor for achieving both environmental conservation and long-term economic growth. this research aims to assess and prioritize national policies aimed at fostering a sustainable supply chain within the automobile industry, employing the multiple criteria decision making (mcdm) model. this study proposes an integrated approach that considers a diverse range of criteria encompassing environmental impact, economic viability, social equity, and technological innovation, ensuring a comprehensive evaluation of policy effectiveness. the methodology comprises three main phases: identification and selection of relevant criteria, collection and validation of data from authoritative sources, and the application of the mcdm model to rank national policies. the analytic hierarchy process (ahp) is employed to determine the relative importance of criteria, and the technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (topsis) is utilized to establish policy rankings based on their alignment with the identified criteria. sensitivity analysis is conducted to validate the robustness of the outcomes and to explore the impact of varying criteria weights. the outcomes of this study provide a nuanced understanding of the strengths and limitations of prevailing national policies concerning sustainable supply chains within the automobile industry. by offering a systematic framework for policy evaluation, policymakers are empowered to pinpoint areas for enhancement and make well-informed decisions that harmonize with broader sustainability and economic objectives. furthermore, the proposed mcdm model showcases its efficacy as a valuable instrument for addressing intricate, multidimensional policy challenges not confined to the automobile sector, thereby fostering evidence-based policy formulation and sustainable progress.","sustainable scm, tehran",,"mohammad hossein shaverdi master’s student in public policy department of economics allameh tabatabaei university tehran, iran mh.shaverdi@gmail.com meysam shaverdi phd candidate in supply chain and logistics school of accounting, information systems and supply chain rmit university melbourne, australia s3679386@student.rmit.edu.au, meisam.shaverdi@gmail.com",
16,"Barriers To Creativity In Distributed Product Development  Annika Bastian, Yaser Kassem, Christoph Kempf And Albert Albers","processes involving creative problem-solving are known to be challenging for distributed teams. to better support product development teams working in distributed settings with their creative processes, the positive and negative influences on creativity need to be known and understood. this contribution focuses on delivering a broad understanding of specifically the barriers to creative problem-solving. to reach this goal a systematic literature review was carried out where 418 initial results were found and then systematically broken down to the 49 most relevant results. 47 barriers were identified, analyzed and integrating into an impact model that now shows not only success factors but also barriers to creativity. with the impact model at hand, targeted support can be created to overcome the challenges distributed teams face when it comes to creative processes.","creativity, virtual teams","and Outlook It has been shown through the results of the systematic literature review that a variety of barriers to creativity in distributed product development exists. These barriers have been collected and explained in chapter 4. Barriers to creativity in Distributed Product Development to answer the first research question. The individual barriers are described and their inhibiting effect on creativity is explained. The majority of barriers stem from the categories of Individual, Team, and Organization. Upon closer examination of the individual factors and descriptions, it becomes evident that the categories of Technology, Culture, Leadership, and Time also possess essential barriers, which are necessary for a comprehensive understanding, differentiation and gathering of inhibitors of creativity. The interconnections between the barriers as well as the interconnections between clusters are explained and shown in detail in Chapter 4. Barriers to creativity in Distributed Product Development answering research questions two and three. The barriers were integrated into the impact model by Bastian et al. (2023) resulting in a graphical representation of the entirety of success factors and barriers to creativity and the high number of interconnections. Since the number of virtual teams keeps on rising (Dekoninck and Brenninkmeijer 2022), the need for further research on how to nurture creativity is clear. Clear is also, that the barriers found cannot claim completeness, since barriers that are not yet described in literature might be found when collecting data in the field. An example from personal experience is an additional barrier concerning language barriers. Language barriers can not only be due to different languages themselves but also due to domain-specific language. Furthermore, some barriers consist of different aspects and might need to be broken down into multiple barriers after further research. Conducting detailed studies in the field is the next step for detailing and developing the impact model further in an iterative process. However, the impact model serves as a foundation for future research in the realm of fostering creativity. Especially the category culture seems to be an interesting starting point for further studies and for developing additional support for distributed product development teams since more and more teams are multicultural and distributed. Finding ways to overcome the barriers, especially within this category and to enhance the success factors are also next steps within a follow-up study.

18,Industry 4.0-Based Energy-Value Stream Mapping:  Connecting The Flow Of Value With Energy Consumption In,"the development of a more efficient and effective flow of value in an organization or supply chain has been an extensively researched topic in the literature. value stream mapping (vsm) has stood out as one of the most applied methods due to its ease of application and practical comprehension. vsm has also been used as a means to enhance the sustainability of value streams. with the emergence of industry 4.0 (i4.0), disruptive technologies may affect the way value streams are designed, leading to more assertive decision-making processes and contributing to enhancing sustainability of value streams. nevertheless, few studies have actually combined i4.0 technologies and vsm to concomitantly address the flows of value and energy in an organization. this study aims at proposing a i4.0-based energy-vsm approach. this approach integrates different i4.0 technologies with complementary roles throughout a value stream, allowing the real-time assessment of the implications of the decisions in both material and information flows over the energy flow. to illustrate our proposition, a case study in a manufacturing company was carried out. this company has a solid continuous improvement management system, and more recently it has developed a program to undergo the digital transformation fostered by i4.0. this case study enabled the verification of the actual benefits and challenges inherent to the proposed approach, raising practical and theoretical contributions to the body of knowledge.","industry 4.0, energy",,"real time guilherme luz tortorella the university of melbourne melbourne, australia guilherme.tortorella@unimelb.edu.au daniel nascimento universidad de barcelona barcelona, spain nascimentodaniel63@gmail.com",

20,A Leagile Supply Chain Model For The Effective Mitigation  Of Sudden Risks,"the leagile supply chain (sc) approach, merging lean and agile strategies, has gained traction within the dynamic landscape of food manufacturing industries. by combining the efficiency of lean practices with the adaptability of agile principles, leagile scs adeptly handle both regular operations and disruptions. this study explores the functioning of leagile scs in various scenarios, highlighting their efficacy in efficient inventory management and rapid response to market changes, i.e., demand surges. additionally, it discusses potential avenues for future research, including technological advancements and sustainable practices, aiming to reshape the food manufacturing sc landscape for enhanced industry standards and improved customer experiences.","supply chain, lean, agile, simulation","and future research directions The leagile supply chain emerges as a vital strategy in the dynamic food manufacturing landscape, seamlessly blending lean and agile strategies. This helps businesses to navigate normal and disrupted scenarios adeptly. Leagile SCs employ postponement and just-in-time inventory strategies in the normal scenario, harmonizing production and demand for efficient inventory management, reduced lead times, and timely customer satisfaction. The alignment of production processes with orders optimizes resource utilization, embodying lean principles. The true strength of leagile SCs shines during disruptions, responding swiftly to a surge in demand. By delaying customization until orders are received, companies enhance responsiveness, mitigating risks of stockouts or overstocking. This adaptability aligns with agile methodology, fulfilling customer needs without compromising efficiency. Looking forward, future research could refine leagile strategies. Advanced data analytics and predictive modeling could enhance demand forecasting, enabling proactive decisions. Exploring IoT and blockchain may enhance transparency and traceability, improving quality control and risk management. Integrating sustainability into leagile SCs balances lean and agile principles with environmental concerns, leading to optimized resource use and reduced waste. Therefore, the leagile SC model blends efficiency with adaptability, enabling food manufacturers to tackle routine and unexpected challenges. As the industry progresses, refining leagile strategies and embracing technology and sustainability will reshape food manufacturing SCs, elevating standards and customer experiences.","towfique rahman uts business school, university of technology sydney, sydney, australia towfique.rahman@uts.edu.au sanjoy kumar paul uts business school, university of technology sydney, sydney, australia sanjoy.paul@uts.edu.au",
21,A Simulation-Optimisation-Based Decision Support System  For Optimising Project Risk Treatment Decisions,"the growing complexity of contemporary projects increases the chance that project risks with different natures are interrelated through complex cause-effect relationships. however, the effects of risk interdependencies and dynamic risk propagations are often ignored in previous project risk management studies, leading to inconsistent risk assessment results with engineering practice and reduced efficacy of risk treatment actions. this research proposes an intelligent decision support system (dss) to determine an effective portfolio of risk treatment actions by considering complex risk interdependencies and project resource constraints. first, a hierarchical project risk interdependency network (rin) is developed systematically based on the interpretive structural modelling process, where all possible cause-effect interdependencies among project risks are presented. then, a monte carlo simulation (mcs)-based rin model is devised to prioritise project risks and evaluate the overall project risk level, where the stochastic behaviour of risk occurrence and risk propagation effects within a project rin are captured. subsequently, a bi-objective risk treatment optimisation model is proposed considering limited project resources, aiming to minimise not only the project loss due to risk but also the risk treatment cost. to obtain a set of pareto-optimal risk treatment solutions, the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii is tailored by integrating with the mcs-based rin model. a case study is provided to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed dss for project risk treatment decision-making. the findings from this work help project decision-makers allocate risk treatment budgets more appropriately and determine the most effective risk treatment solution corresponding to their risk attitudes.",risk treatment,,"considering risk interdependencies li guan and josé m. merigó school of computer science faculty of engineering and information technology university technology sydney (uts) ultimo, nsw 2007, australia li.guan@uts.edu.au, jose.merigo@uts.edu.au ripon k. chakrabortty and alireza abbasi school of systems and computing university of new south wales (unsw) canberra, act 2600, australia r.chakrabortty@adfa.edu.au, a.abbasi@unsw.edu.au",
22,An Exact Solution Method For Cooking Scheduling  Optimization Problems Considering Various Constraints Of,"this study formulates a cooking scheduling optimization problem as a combinatorial optimization problem. this study seeks schedules for mass cooking of more than 100 servings. steam convection ovens which can cook multiple dishes in large quantities are used in high-volume cooking facilities. previous studies have proposed a formulation that applies a flexible job shop scheduling problem. they have not been able to determine the processing machinery for each process. in addition, there is no constraint to prevent contamination. therefore, realistic schedules were not obtained. in many developed countries, sanitation control based on haccp is mandatory. a cooking facility consists of two main areas. they are contaminated areas and uncontaminated areas. the former is an area where meat and fish are processed prior to heating. the latter is an area where heat treatment and food cutting are performed. bacteria can spread throughout cooking facilities when they adhere to the floor and cooks' shoes. therefore, cooks should take an air shower and change shoes when moving between the two areas. three constraints must be considered when cooking in large quantities with cooks and machines. first, all cooks must move in only one direction between contaminated work areas and non-contaminated work areas. cross contamination can be prevented by moving these areas in only one direction. second, works on steam convection ovens must be started after preheating is complete. it takes more time to lower the temperature in steam convection ovens than to raise it. preheating time can be reduced by working in a sequence of gradually increasing heating temperatures. cook's workload can be reduced by working as many jobs as possible on a steam convection oven at the same time. unit time is a discrete value of one minute. third, when several cooks work on the same task, they must start at the same time. we seek optimal cooking schedules given the number of cooks and machines, the type of machine, and recipes for multiple dishes. a directed acyclic graph called a dag is created by using arcs to connect processes that have priority relationships within a recipe. within a dag, a job is defined as a set of the nodes with a fixed antecedent relationship. there are pairs of precedence relationships between the processes of two different jobs. this information is used to create a constraint equation that adhere to the preceding relationship. the purpose of the formulation is to minimize the start time difference between processes working on steam convection in addition to the makespan. there are two things to decide in this problem. the first is the order in which jobs are worked on each machine. the second is the assignment of processing machines to each process.numerical experiments were conducted on several example problems. as a result, we succeeded in obtaining exact solutions for small-scale problems. in the future, we will receive evaluations from workers at cooking facilities. in addition, we will make improvements based on them.",sanitation control,,"cooking facilities kosuke kobayashi and hideki katagiri department of industrial engineering and management, faculty of engineering kanagawa university kanagawa, japan r202270110la@jindai.jp, katagiri@kanagawa-u.ac.jp",
23,"Video Based Work Instructions (Vwi) And Its Role In  Improving Employee Training, Cross Training, And","one of the biggest challenges facing small and medium manufacturers in today’s economic environment is the recruitment and retention of talent across all functions in an organization. it is extremely challenging to find and keep shop floor associates as welders, painters, machinists, and assemblers. even if an organization can hire skilled personnel, training them on specialized equipment and work practices takes a lot of effort and time. work instructions (wi) or standard operating procedures (sop) are a set of instructions that enumerate all the steps and activities required to complete a job. traditional wi or sop suffer from many disadvantages: they are hard to control, difficult to understand in many situations, time consuming to create and maintain, and do not capture the tacit knowledge of trained employees effectively. to overcome the challenges posed by regular sop, a new way of creating them has gained traction in the last few years called video work instructions (vwi). in this approach, a video of the manufacturing process is taken while the operation is being carried out. the video is later edited to include the work instruction in the frames during the actual operation. in this project, vwi was created for a medium manufacturer in southern mn for welding and assembly processes. the vwi was later used in employee training and cross training. it was found that there was a reduction of the new employee training period by approximately 50% and a productivity increase by approximately 12%. this paper will talk about the advantages and challenges associated with such an approach.","productivity, training, cross training","The traditional form of written SOPs has outlived their usefulness on the modern shop floor. Today the shop floors have computer terminals attached to each machine and the operators and employees have access to tablets and smartphones which can be leveraged for better learning and analysis of operations. In these times, it is important to evolve the current practices of standard operations and introduce modern technologies which are easier to implement and use in day-to-day operations. Digitization in the training methods is showing a lot of demand in many sectors. For example, Bonnes et al. (2020) showed that trainers who attended a course in digital media had higher media-didactical competence and media-didactical self-efficacy scores and used digital media more often in training. Key to the success of many companies in today’s competitive economy is also the implementation of lean manufacturing principles which support standardization and use of advanced technologies to reduce waste and variations. Companies that have implemented lean manufacturing principles have also reported the knowledge-related issues as one of the barriers of success which goes back to simplified training methods (Abu et al., 2019). Stanica and Peydro (2016) also found that use of modern cross-training methods aligned as a lean tool has a positive effect on the knowledge transfer process within the organizations. Cross-training methods used as a lean tool can help broaden the knowledge and the competences of employees and can help companies manage tacit knowledge in the long run. How knowledge transfer is happening in an organization plays a key role in an organization's long-term success (Argote & Ingram, 2000). Not all lean organizations have achieved the expected results due to many issues such as cultural readiness of the organization, employee training, and continuous improvement techniques that are not compatible with the organization’s preexisting processes, and programs. Sometimes organizations discount the benefit of training for a particular job or for a continuous improvement program in a smaller scale and simplified way such as using modern technologies such as VWIs. In other words, companies sometimes complicate the training method by overusing technology instead of simplifying it (Biortolotti, Boscari & Danese, 2015). 194","productivity in small and medium manufacturing enterprise kuldeep agarwal and pawan bhandari department of automotive and manufacturing engineering technology minnesota state university mankato, mn 56001, usa kuldeep.agarwal@mnsu.edu; pawan.bhandari@mnsu.edu","References

24,Improvement Proposal To Achieve Shrinkage Reduction  In Home Dispatch Process In Retail Company,"in this research the problem is the generation of wastage in the home dispatch (hd) process and in the reverse logistics of a retail sector company, so its main objective will be to reduce them. the dmaic methodology was used for process improvement. the engineering tools used correspond to lean six sigma such as process standardization and poka yoke. after simulating the improvement proposal with the arena software, the main results obtained were, at 95% confidence, the reduction in the number of reentries, wastage, and absenteeism, as evidenced by the decrease in the confidence interval limits. for the quantity of reentries indicator, the simulated improvement yields a confidence interval of [43.7081 ; 49.8239] units of product re-entered, resulting in values lower than those obtained in the current situation, according to its confidence interval [99.7428 ; 111.3172] units of product re-entered. for the quantity of wastage indicator, the simulated improvement yields an approximate confidence interval of [6.3968 ; 8.8032] units of product wasted, resulting in lower values than those obtained in the current situation, according to its confidence interval [21.4576 ; 25.8744] units of product wasted. for the number of absent customers indicator, the simulated improvement yields an approximate confidence interval of [2.5717 ; 4.0949] absent customers, resulting in values lower than those obtained in the current situation, according to its confidence interval [31.1758 ; 37.1562] absent customers. keyword shrinkage, reverse logistics, dispatch, dc, and lean six sigma. 1. introduction shrinkage in the home dispatch process represents a loss for any company, not only because it represents lost sales, but also because the customer goes through a bad experience and, if it cannot be declared an expense, it would also become an economic loss (donderis et al., 2019). nowadays, all consumers live in an omnichannel environment, using both online and offline channels to shop. the result is an increase in shipments to customers' homes, driving companies to improve their freight systems, making them more efficient and sustainable (buldeo et al., 2019). due to the recent omnichannel boom, the current freight systems of companies that ship products directly to the customer's home are still in the process of optimization. this generates customer dissatisfaction due to failures of the system itself, causing a high number of product returns to the dc’s inventory. these returns imply a greater handling of the product, which increases the probability that it will be damaged, generating losses when it turns into shrinkage. considering that most processes generate shrinkage or defective products, it is of great importance for companies to look for ways to reduce these losses, thus improving their productivity (donderis et al., 2019). in the same way, the processes involved in home dispatch consume resources such as processing time (h-h), the material that was used in packaging and shipping, etc. if to this is added the wastage generated, it results in a significant cost. in addition, waste contributes to environmental pollution, as it is part of the company's solid waste. currently, a major problem of concern to society is pollution, which, in turn, is one of the various causes of climate change. the latter has negative effects such as global warming, rising sea levels, adverse effects on various resources, among others (condori, j. et al., 2022, p. 1). given that pollution is the beginning of several environmental problems, it is important to mitigate its causes, such as the generation and inadequate management of solid waste. the lack of knowledge about the care of the ecosystem and the effects of its deterioration have aggravated this problem, since people tend to prioritize their own economic benefit before environmental welfare (delgado et al., 2021, p. 614). 1.1. objectives the general objective of the research is to reduce the waste generated in the hd process in a retail sector company. the specific objectives are as follows: 196",,,"alison pimentel piscoya, katherine hidalgo reyna and ezilda cabrera gil grados facultad de ingeniería universidad de lima, perú 20191556@aloe.ulima.edu.pe, 20190949@aloe.ulima.edu.pe, ecabrera@ulima.edu.pe","References

25,A Study Of Investment Catalysts: Unraveling  Determinants Of Fixed Assets In The Construction Industry,"with the engagement of advanced technology in the civil engineering industry, automation and prefabrication of fixed assets is in huge demand fixed assets stand as integral components for the operational efficacy of firms, which in return helps in the growth of that whole industry. the primary objective of this study is to find the determinants of investment in fixed assets in the construction industry. the study has considered five construction companies selected on the basis of their age, profitability and paid-up capital. the stepwise multiple regression models; addition model, constant model, and elimination model, have been employed to analyze and check the robustness of the results. the study results align with empirical findings, highlighting the significance of profit in business investment choices. the stock of net liquidity plays a more important role in the investment, followed by gross internal funds and change in sales. retained earnings impact investments, while dividends influence external funding inflow, and earnings affect dividends. profits have direct and indirect effects on investments through retained earnings and external finance. it's essential to balance dividend pay-outs to safeguard substantial profits, given the substantial role retained earnings play in investment decisions. the novelty of this study will provide valuable insights to understand how to control various factors in order to increase fixed assets through investments and in return, grow the firm.",fixed assets,"In the past, there has been considerable interest in many sectors over the level of growth of larger firms in terms of increased fixed assets, sales, and profits. This research is limited to the expansion of net fixed assets. Given the preceding discussion, it is critical to understand the variables responsible for the expansion of fixed assets and plant and machinery separately. Through this study, an attempt was made to analyse the fixed investment pattern of the construction industry of India. To perform this study, five construction companies and six years of study period have been fixed. To find the best model, which determines the investment behaviour in fixed assets, a statistical method is used. Observing the financial statement and various literature related to the topic, notable variables are selected to perform the required analysis. After completion of calculation and analysis, one can say that Stock of Net Liquidity, Gross Internal Funds and Change in Sales are the determinants, which will impart high influence in investment policy-making to increase the Fixed Assets in selected firms. These three variables are found to be significant in almost every firm and Construction Industry considered as a whole. 7. Limitations of the study 1.

26,Topology Optimization Of The Bell Crank Lever  R. Narasimha Rao,"bell crank is a kind of lever which is used to alter the course of the movement. it is exposed to huge stress but designing it with heavier mass creates the requirement of heavier actuation. in the present study, the basic design of the bell crank was modelled in cad software. four generally used materials for bell crank (1060 alloy steel, al bronze, aisi4130 mild steel, nodular cast iron) were used in the design. the stress in the bell crank during operation was measured using solidworks software. based on the stress distribution in the bell crank, the solid isotropic material with penalization method was utilized to optimize the shape of bell crank. the manufacturing constraints were also considered during optimization. using the topology optimization algorithm, fifty percentage of mass was reduced without compromising the weight to stiffness ratio of the bell crank. the material was removed within the boundary of the standard bell crank. the linear static loading was assumed to identify the optimal locations for material removal. among the materials that are utilized, the nodular cast iron is best for the shape optimization although all four materials can be used to reduce fifty percentage of the material from standard bell crank. except the alloy steel, all three materials have further room for optimization but due to its low density compared to other three, alloy steel is preferred material for the bell crank.","bell crank, specific strength","In the current study, a standard bell crank was designed in solid works with four different materials. These bell cranks were then studied for the stress distribution. Based on the stress distribution, the areas with low stress were removed to reduce the weight. The removed zones were then finished to make the material removal manufacturing friendly. The conclusions of this study are • 1060 Alloy aluminium-based crank have less weight after optimization compared to other three materials. The weight of the 1060 alloy aluminium is 67% lower than the weight of nodular cast iron. 224","professor department of mechanical engineering national institute of technology warangal warangal, telangana, india rnrao@nitw.ac.in ch. sri chaitanya asst. professor, department of mechanical engineering velagapudi ramakrishna siddhartha engineering college, kanuru vijayawada, andhra pradesh, india srichaitanya178@gmail.com","References

27,Demand Forecasting For Catering Bento By Machine  Learning Using Automatic Estimation Of Product Popularity,"""bento"" is widely known as a part of japanese food culture. there are many companies in japan that produce thousands of bento every day. in recent years, the market for the catering bento industry has been expanding, and the demand for catering bento has been increasing. catering bento companies seek to automate demand forecasting. the forecasters in the field forecast demand based on their intuition and experience. however, it is difficult for unskilled workers to make accurate demand forecasts. it is important to take into account the popularity of bento in order to forecast demand with a high degree of accuracy. in a previous study, mcmc sampling was used to estimate the popularity of bento. specifically, based on past data on unit sales of bento, the number of sales of two products were compared to estimate which product was more popular. the problem with the popularity estimation in the previous study is that the popularity estimation is partially done manually by humans. the objective of this study is to automate the estimation of the popularity of bento. the novelty of this study is that products with similar popularity are grouped together based on an assumption. the assumption is that the popularity of bento is determined by the words in the product name and the characteristics of the dish. the new popularity estimation method is to calculate cosine similarity using four element groups and to group products with similar popularity by hierarchical clustering. the four element groups are dish name, dish category, cooking method, and the number of units sold. the popularity of the bento is estimated by mcmc sampling. to test the usefulness of the new popularity estimation method, we construct a demand forecasting model that takes into account the popularity of bento estimated by the new method. the forecasting accuracy of the proposed model and that of the conventional model are compared. the popularity of bento proposed in this study is used in the proposed model. the popularity of bento proposed in the previous study is used in the conventional model. the method used in the demand forecasting model is a gradient boosting decision tree. the features used in the demand forecasting model are the predicted total number of units sold on the forecast day, the temperature, the popularity of the bento, and the number of bento sold in the past. a numerical experiment was conducted using data provided by a bento manufacturing-sales company which manufactures and sells more than 10,000 catered bento per day. the company sells three types of bento, including daily bento, rice bowl bento and noodle bento. in the accuracy comparison using actual data, the proposed model and the conventional model had the same level of prediction accuracy. thus, we conclude that the popularity of bento could be automatically estimated.","demand forecast, machine learning",,"koki kitabayashi department of industrial engineering and management, graduate school of engineering kanagawa university kanagawa, japan r202270104pa@jindai.jp hideki katagiri department of industrial engineering and management, faculty of engineering kanagawa university kanagawa, japan katagiri@kanagawa-u.ac.jp",
28,An Automatic Menu Creation Model For School Lunch  Based On Mathematical Optimization Considering The,"according to a survey conducted by the ministry of education, culture, sports, science and technology, school lunch is provided in approximately 98.5% of public elementary schools in japan. each region has different rules regarding the kinds of dishes and ingredients provided in school lunch menus and the frequency of serving dishes and ingredients. it is time-consuming and labor-intensive for menu planners to prepare menus when manually adapting them to the actual conditions of each region. as a result, the workload of menu planners and nutrition teachers is high. in the field of school lunch menu planning, the menu planning systems are needed to support nutrition teachers. the menu creation process is time-consuming and labor-intensive because there are many constraints to be taken into account, such as nutritional intake standards, ingredient costs, and cooking time. in japan, the intake of 13 nutrients is determined according to the school meal intake standards established by the ministry of education, culture, sports, science and technology. therefore, when preparing menus, it is necessary to keep within the upper and lower limits of the standard's intake. numerous studies have been conducted on automatic menu planning systems for school lunch programs. for example, some studies have been conducted on budgets and coloring of dishes, as well as studies that focus on the diversity of ingredients and flavors by calculating the similarity between dishes or ingredients. all of these studies have been formulated as combinatorial optimization problems and have proposed automatic menu creation models. however, it takes a lot of time and effort to reflect the actual situation of each region in the automatic menu creation model. in these previous studies, the engineers who proposed the menu planning model interviewed nutrition teachers who work in the menu development field many times. after the interviews, they manually modify the proposed model based on the feedback they received. specifically, they manually calculate the frequency of serving dishes and ingredients and generate constraints. they have done this work many times to improve the automatic menu creation model. in this study, we propose an automatic menu creation model for school lunch that automatically reflects the actual conditions of each region regarding the frequency of serving dishes and ingredients. we aim to propose a menu creation model that can be used in school lunch programs in elementary and junior high schools throughout japan. first, morphological analysis is used to segment the dishes and ingredients in the daily menu into meaningful words such as nouns and adjectives, and to automatically calculate the frequency of serving the dishes and ingredients during a month. next, we use the results of the calculation to construct an algorithm that automatically adds constraints to the mathematical optimization problem. as a result of the analysis using actual data from school lunch menus, we succeeded in automatically calculating the frequency of serving dishes and ingredients, and generating an algorithm for automatically adding constraints. 228",,,"frequency of dishes and ingredients himawari takeuchi department of industrial engineering and management, graduate school of engineering kanagawa university kanagawa, japan r202270137cl@jindai.jp hideki katagiri department of industrial engineering and management, faculty of engineering kanagawa university kanagawa, japan katagiri@kanagawa-u.ac.jp",
29,Lack Of Downstream Processing In The Agriculture Sector In  Papua New Guinea,"papua new guinea (png) is part of the second largest island in the world situated in the pacific ocean. this developing nation is rich in many resources from renewable to non-renewable resources, however the act of downstream processing for the country’s income is still an issue as it is lacking. therefore, the 2023 papua new guinea university of technology (pnguot) industrial engineering and operations management student chapter has taken up the initiative to emphasize on lack of downstream processing in other significant resource extraction sectors in png, which in this case is the agriculture sector. png has surplus agricultural crops and livestock, however, there is a lack of png owned companies that can carry out downstream processing, that can allow income to be generated from the exported finished products in the agriculture sector. this paper focuses on investigating the condition and presenting factual information on the condition and recommendations that could be implemented to rectify the lack of downstream processing in png.","agriculture, downstream, processing, 2023","Lack of downstream processing in PNG is an issue that affecting the economy of this country. It is a serious issue that cannot be ignored, if government would want to improve its economy and the citizens of its citizens. The government has to work on to implement the necessary facilities and infrastructures that will aid and improve the processing of its agricultural produce. This is by ensuring that proper basic services such as roads, bridges, electricity, water, etc. are provided to accommodate for processing of its raw produce. And also, by creating processing factories and market opportunities in the country will enable minimizing the issue. Two classical examples of lack of downstream processing in the coffee and palm oil has been explained by providing challenges and the proposed improvements. Therefore, this will in turn improve the livelihoods of the local citizens and also the economy of the country.","sandy stephen and stephanie laki year 3 undergraduate, department of mechanical engineering, papua new guinea university of technology, lae, mp411, papua new guinea",
30,Analysis Of A Workload In Healthcare Through A Simulation  Experiment And Data Acquisition By Wearable Devices,"in the healthcare field, workload management is important because the workload of healthcare professionals such as nurses affects the safety and quality of treatment and care for patients. however, changing circumstances surrounding operations are inevitable in healthcare, and workloads change from time to time in response to changing circumstances. therefore, management is required to accommodate such changes. for this purpose, it is necessary to predict the workload in real time based on various factors such as the state of workers under changing conditions and reflect this in management, but no method has been established to predict the workload in healthcare in real time in response to changing conditions. therefore, in this study, focusing on the development of internet of things (iot) technologies, we conducted a simulation experiment in a simulated ward environment and acquired data that could be acquired by wearable devices available in real time to analyze the workload change during tasks. several indicators showed a significant main effect on workload (p < 0.01), suggesting that multiple indicators of patient and ward conditions can be obtained in real time are effective in the evaluation of workload.","human factors, wearable device","In this study, a simulation experiment was conducted in a simulated hospital ward environment to analyze workloads in healthcare aiming at applying for measuring and visualizing workload in real time. Each of the information on workers, patients, and wards conditions, measured during the experiment showed a certain relationship with the workload variation. It was suggested that the indicators obtained in real time using a wearable device are sufficiently effective for workload prediction, and it is expected that such devices will be used to support by using data related to healthcare professionals.

32,Analysis Of The Integration Of Monitoring Approaches Using  Strategic Foresight In The Product Engineering Process,"it is essential to develop products that are successful in future markets. however, product engineering often takes several years or even longer, and anticipating the needs and requirements for products is necessary. strategic foresight provides a solution for identifying future product needs and requirements as well as product properties. given the constantly changing environment, it is necessary to continually adapt the results of strategic foresight. changes can be identified through shifting forecasts and trends. to ensure the success of the product in development, changes in the environment must be continuously integrated into the product engineering process (pep). thus, the relationship between monitoring changes in the future through foresight approaches and in the product during the pep is important. this paper aims to analyze the integration of monitoring into the product engineering process based on elements of strategic foresight. the main objective was to identify whether existing approaches support this integration, by conducting a systematic literature review analyzing 1,664 research results. here, no suitable approaches were identified in the literature. therefore, to enable the integration of such approaches into the pep, existing foresight approaches were examined to determine the extent to which monitoring approaches can be linked to them. during the examination of existing foresight approaches, especially scenario methods, commonalities were identified. although these run individually, they generate the same results, such as influencing and key factors. these commonalities can be used as starting points for monitoring. to define these starting points, general monitoring approaches were examined to compare their structure and process. here, different processes and structures of the approaches were identified, making it challenging to derive uniform elements for linking to foresight approaches in pep. the central finding of this research work is that a design support must be defined to enable linkage and integration into the pep. initial preliminary work is suitable, in which product properties are derived from the scenarios themselves, as well as key factors. a link between product properties, scenarios, and key factors exists, which can be used for the operationalization of monitoring but has not yet been defined. in summary, different approaches to monitoring exist, but they have different procedures and structures, making integration into the pep challenging. however, the uniformity of the scenario processes provides a good starting point for developing support for the monitoring of environments, which can help derive the impact on product properties in the event of changes. this enables the pep to react to changes in the future and develop products that are robust for the future.","foresight, monitoring, scenarios",,"carsten thümmel, miriam kleinschrot, stefan eric schwarz, andreas siebe and albert albers institute of product engineering (ipek) karlsruhe institute of technology (kit) 76131 karlsruhe, germany carsten.thuemmel@kit.edu, miriam.kleinschrot@student.kit.edu, stefan.schwarz@kit.edu, siebe@zukunftsingenieur.de, albert.albers@kit.edu",
33,Digital Platform Business Model Within The Model Of   Sge System Generation Engineering:,"adding internet technologies to mechatronic system solutions is the next step for industry 4.0 and has a high potential for digital platform business models linked with cyber-physical system (cps). the model of sge – system generation engineering describes the development of systems on subsystem level. so far, no known research investigated a coherent definition explaining a digital platform business model in the model of sge according to cps. within a four- phase methodology, a systematic literature analysis identifies and processes 55 relevant definitions and extracts a data set of 32 definitions after eliminating 23 duplicates. in a semantic analysis, crucial primary and externally linking terms, combined with five case study findings, reveal the artefact, an economic platform with five characteristics. after initially validating the artefact, a workshop and academic discussion result in an intermediate artefact, further validated in a subsequent expert workshop. findings suggest the terms value added, infrastructure, exchange, interaction, and openness describe digital platform business models. essential defining aspects must entail facilitating value added through a multisided market by integrating specific entities, providing an open and/or closed infrastructure for flexible and compatible networking components, integrating data between the cps and the platform, creating trustworthy and economic value added through entities, and scaling by network effects. this paper shows how to extract a precise, coherent, valuable, and iteratively validated definition to create a common understanding within a research field. practitioners can learn about the digital platform business model concept within the model of sge, supporting knowledge creation, research, and product development of cps in generations. the originality of this work lies in extracting a validated definition by applying sophisticated tools and methods to guarantee its robustness.",definition,,"definition and classification in cyber-physical systems albert albers professor institute of product engineering (ipek) karlsruhe institute of technology (kit) karlsruhe, germany albert.albers@kit.edu carsten h. hahn, patrick brecht and ümüs cetinkaya karlsruhe university of applied sciences institute of applied research (iaf) karlsruhe, germany carsten.hahn@h-ka.de, patrick.brecht@h-ka.de, uemues.cetinkaya@h-ka.de felix pfaff, michael schlegel and maximilian fischer institute of product engineering (ipek) karlsruhe institute of technology (kit) karlsruhe, germany felix.pfaff@kit.edu, michael.schlegel@kit.edu, maxmilian.fischer@kit.edu",
34,Performance Assessment Of Physically-Constrained Fixedlane Queueing Systems,"the study of queueing systems has been around for decades. since, at its most basic level, queueing systems are considered as continuous-time markov chains, the study of queueing theory must adhere to numerous assumptions. most of these assumptions deal with the distribution and behavior of customer arrivals and service times, as these are often illustrated as poisson processes. service prioritization, capacities, and customer behaviors such as balking and reneging are also often considered in model assumptions. often not considered are the physical constraints associated with real-world queueing systems. in several real-world queues, customer movement is constrained by the available physical space, such as consecutive toll booths or grocery counters. there are multi-server queues with only one lane wherein a customer that has been served by the initial server cannot move out of the system if subsequent servers are still busy, thus rendering the initial server still occupied. in addition, servers located after the initial one cannot be accessed even if they are vacant if the initial server is still occupied. due to this, the behavior of the system greatly differs from those of similar queueing systems where physical constraints are assumed to be non-existent. through simulation, the study has evaluated that the performance of the physically-constrained queueing setup can lead to waiting times and queue lengths of up to 6 times greater than that of a traditional m/m/2 queue, especially for a relatively high level of customer arrivals. improvements to these metrics are also measured upon the implementation of proposed corrective schemes that aim to ease the physical restrictions of queueing.","queueing theory, blocking","and Areas for Future Work The study was able to compare a physically-constrained two-server queueing system to traditional 2 M/M/1 queues and a single M/M/2 queueing system. The difference was quantified and it was found that W and L are both significantly larger (up to 600% greater) with the physically-constrained setup compared to the M/M/2. This significant performance decrease should be put into consideration when designing physically-constrained queueing systems, and a simple alternative of creating a departure channel specifically for customers at server 1 would be of great benefit to system performance. As future work, it is recommended that further analysis be done on the blocking time of the servers to provide more insight into the queueing system. This study could also be extended to scenarios with multiple servers beyond two servers.","simon anthony lorenzo assistant professor department of industrial engineering and operations research university of the philippines diliman metro manila, philippines sdlorenzo@up.edu.ph lizabeth ann franco lecturer department of industrial engineering and operations research university of the philippines diliman metro manila, philippines ldfranco@up.edu.ph",
35,Systematic Literature Review: A Comparative Study Of  Tech-Startup Success Factors Between Developing And,"tech startups' popularity has attracted investors, entrepreneurs, policymakers, and scholars for decades. furthermore, a tech startup is a concept of entrepreneurship that utilizes the role of new and innovative technology to drive the firm's scalability in terms of investment and profit creation. in the western world, a tech startup is not new, and the emergence of the world's renowned tech startup ecosystem, such as silicon valley, has inspired other parts of the world to do so in developing entrepreneurship. in this paper, a systematic literature review was conducted to investigate the success factors of tech startups in both developing and developed economies. the search string found 3,062 academic papers, and 57 studies were selected and analyzed due to the systematic review. the result shows 13 success factors identified in developing economies and 15 success factors in developed economies. the initial result of the systematic review of the startup success factors reveals a significant difference between success factors in developing and developed countries. in developing economies, external and organizational factors are the most relevant to the startup's success. on the other hand, in advanced economies, the most relevant factors are driven by individual factors.","success factors, digital startup, advanced economies",,"advance economies sonny hendra sudaryana, budisantoso wirjodirdjo, and agus windharto school of interdisciplinary management and technology sepuluh nopember institute of technology (its) surabaya, indonesia sonnysudaryana@gmail.com, budisantoso.wirjodirdjo@gmail.com, aguswindharto19@gmail.com ihya ulumuddin sy school of business and management bandung institute of technology (itb) bandung, indonesia ihyausy@gmail.com",
36,Bridging Efficiency And Empathy: The Role Of  Psychosocial Safety Climate In Mitigating Emotional,"managing employee emotional stress is one of the most significant global challenges in the manufacturing sector today, and it is anticipated to exacerbate the trend in the coming years. notably, employee work-related stress is responsible for 12 billion lost workdays and a cost of over us$1 trillion to the worldwide economy annually. furthermore, australian businesses incur an annual cost exceeding $11 billion due to insufficient attention to their employees' mental health needs. employee emotional stress occurs when there are discrepancies between the physiological demands of a workplace and the inability of employees to manage the work demands. there is a need for fresh viewpoints in light of recent scholarly discussions on employee emotional well-being, particularly the psychosocial safety climate, due to its features connected with employee emotional stress. the commitment of management and their support for employee psychological health to mitigate work-related stress is referred to as the psychosocial safety climate. it represents organisational policies, practices, and procedures for protecting workers' psychological health and safety. the authors propose investigating the relationship between psychological safety climate and emotional stress, optimising lean manufacturing environment, and upholding robust occupational health and safety practices. it will also allow the creation of the appropriate conditions for establishing and sustaining a psychosocial safety climate among manufacturing firms to mitigate employee emotional stress levels. this transformation involves shaping workplaces seamlessly, integrating efficiency and empathy, and propelling toward a future where manufacturing synchronises with the cadence of human resilience.","emotional stress, manufacturing 292",,"stress in lean manufacturing environment g.g. udaya priyasantha rathnayake phd candidate school of business faculty of business and law university of wollongong (uow) nsw, australia ggupr082@uowmail.edu.au anil chandrakumara senior lecturer school of business and law university of wollongong australia anilc@uow.edu.au anura de zoysa associate professor school of business and law university of wollongong australia anura@uow.edu.au","References

37,Corporate Credit Rating Estimation Using Stacking With  Base Models Based On Groups Of Classified Features,"a corporate credit rating is an index that evaluates a company's ability to fulfill its debt obligations on a 22-point scale from aaa to d. since obtaining corporate credit rating is very costly, corporate credit rating estimation using machine learning has attracted much attention in recent years. the problem with conventional research is that certain features become noise in the estimation of specific companies, resulting in localized loss of accuracy. in the previous studies, the overall accuracy was improved by using new features in addition to financial indicators in the estimation of corporate credit ratings. however, because the new features became noise in the estimation, the accuracy of some companies was lower than that of the corporate rating estimation using only financial indicators as the features. on the other hand, the stacking suppresses the accuracy loss due to noise. the stacking is built in two stages: in the first stage, the base model is built, and in the second stage, the meta-model is built using the estimates of the base model as features. the design of the base models is critical to the accuracy of the model with the stacking. in this study, we design the base models based on the groups of classified features. for example, the groups of features related to financial indicators includes profitability and safety, etc. the objective of this study is to construct a proposed model using the stacking with base models based on the groups of classified features. in addition, to confirm the usefulness of the proposed model, we compare the accuracy of the proposed model with that of the conventional model that does not use stacking. in this study, the corporate credit rating estimation is treated as a 22-class multi-label classification problem. the method used in the corporate credit rating estimation model is the light gradient boosting machine. in this study, the proposed model uses rating estimates of seven base models. the seven base models include a conventional model, five models using financial indicators, and a model using investment and loan network indicators. the financial indicators used in the five models are based on five groups of financial indicators classified by nikkei needs-financialquest. the five groups are profitability, return on capital, cash flow, return on equity, and safety. we used corporate ratings from japan credit rating agency, inc. for the period from 1999 to 2021 as the labeled training data. numerical experiments were conducted using data from 1,972 firms with 167 indicators. as a result, the proposed model improved the estimation of 53 firms compared to the previous model. the accuracy of the proposed model is 0.798, which is 0.027 points higher than that of the conventional model. the quadratic weighted kappa is 300",,,"sho sato department of industrial engineering and management, graduate school of engineering kanagawa university kanagawa, japan r202370138yo@jindai.jp hideki katagiri department of industrial engineering and management, faculty of engineering kanagawa university kanagawa, japan katagiri@kanagawa-u.ac.jp masanobu matsumaru research institute for engineering kanagawa university kanagawa, japan pt120916cz@kanagawa-u.ac.jp",

40,The Effect Of Multiple Cues On The Quality Perception Of  Crowdfunding Products: A Cue Diagnosticity Framework,"although a lot of research has been done on reward-based crowdfunding, scholars pay little attention to how multiple cues affect the quality perception of crowdfunding products under information asymmetry. to bridge this gap, this paper utilizes a cue diagnosticity framework to differentiate between high-scope cues (the founder’s social capital and online comments) and low-scope cues (the number of pictures, sentences and videos), and empirically investigates how these two types of cues are diagnostic in the process of assessing the product quality. based on the cue diagnosticity framework, under different high-scope cues, this paper puts forward hypotheses about the influence of low-scope cues on backers’ quality perception of crowdfunding products. the findings show that regardless of the social capital and comments of founders, the number of pictures and videos in the introduction of reward-based crowdfunding will have a positive impact on the quality perception of crowdfunding products. when at least one of the founder’s social capital or comments is good, the number of sentences will have a positive effect. however, when the founder’s social capital and comments are poor, the number of sentences will have a negative impact on the quality perception of products. furthermore, we replace the dependent variable and change the classification method of backer’s social capital to ensure the robustness of the results. this paper enriches the research of reward-based crowdfunding, and provides important implications for founders to raise more funds from backers by publishing more effective information.",shenyang,,"yao zhang and ying tian department of operations management, school of economics and management, dalian university of technology, dalian, china yaozhang_dut@163.com, 15940534296@163.com",
41,Enhancing Lean Implementation In Smes: Exploring  Barriers And Hrm Strategies,"this study focuses on analyzing the barriers that small and medium-sized enterprises (smes) face when implementing lean tools and how these barriers are related to human resource management (hrm) practices. through a systematic literature review, 45 academic articles were examined, identifying 20 lean barriers that hinder the successful adoption of these tools. lack of understanding (15.56%), lack of financial capacity (11.11%), and resistance to change (11.11%) were the most common barriers. in addition to identifying barriers, this study highlights critical factors characterizing these limitations and establishes a correlation between these critical factors and the three dimensions of the amo model (ability, motivation, and opportunity) focused on human resource management. this suggests that proper talent management and employee motivation are essential elements to overcome barriers in lean implementation. by expanding the understanding of specific obstacles that smes face on their path to lean implementation, this work provides valuable insights for organizations to design more effective strategies. the contribution of human resource management in employee engagement and commitment is also highlighted as a key factor in achieving a successful and efficient lean development process. with this study, it is hoped that smes can address the identified barriers and adopt lean practices more effectively, enhancing their competitiveness and operational efficiency.","lean manufacturing, smes, barriers, hrm","This research highlights various barriers encountered in the implementation of lean methodology in SMEs. The primary obstacle, identified in our study, is the lack of understanding, followed by financial constraints and resistance to change. To address these barriers, it is crucial for all personnel to participate and commit to organizational improvement. For this purpose, the AMO model, focused on HRM, was applied due to the identified relationship between critical barrier factors and the three dimensions of the model. This approach involves implementing rigorous selection systems, intensive training programs, employee assessments, and initiating performance-based compensation and incentive plans. Furthermore, employees' professional development is planned, and their involvement in organizational decision-making is promoted. To measure the progress of the proposed solution, the following indicators have been established: Compliance with the training program, training budget compliance, total investment in training, attendance rate in training courses, productivity index, internal promotion, performance index, and employee participation in company meetings, knowledge sharing, and training. However, it is important to consider that these indicators may vary depending on the various lean barriers encountered during the implementation of the methodology in SMEs, as each barrier has unique critical factors that characterize it. The lack of knowledge and understanding constitutes the primary barrier to achieving success in lean implementation. It requires a high level of familiarity with lean methodology and demands a cultural change within the organization. However, effecting this change requires an economic investment, the magnitude of which will depend on the tool being employed. Additionally, due to the time required for benefits to materialize, many companies shy away from implementation. There is also a scarcity of guiding models for SMEs in future implementations. Literature analysis reveals that several authors, when implementing lean tools, achieve different results and encounter varied barriers due to the unique characteristics and circumstances of each company. Furthermore, an important limitation was identified regarding the limited availability of information on methodological models implemented in SMEs that could serve as a guide for future implementations of lean tools in companies. There is also a lack of research addressing proposed solutions to overcome these lean barriers. This is significant, as this research has confirmed the existence of a considerable number of lean obstacles highlighted by various authors. This research is designed to assist the organization's top management in understanding the most common barriers and adopting appropriate measures before implementing lean methodology. Furthermore, a solution centered on HRM is proposed due to the need to involve all personnel to achieve success in lean implementation, as demonstrated in this study. In future research, it is crucial to explore diverse approaches to address these obstacles and highlight the importance of presenting, in a case study, the implementation of the AMO model focused on HRM in comparison to lean barriers. 349","diego adrian gerboline-pastor faculty of engineering university of lima lima, perú 20163129@aloe.ulima.edu.pe rafael chavez-ugaz research professor faculty of engineering university of lima rchavezu@ulima.edu.pe","References

42,Open Electric Drive Health Assessment,"electric drives are widely used to regulate the flow of power supply between source to motor either due to process or operation requirement and as means to lower motor’s inrush current. the use of ac electric drives is expected to increase due to pressing need to reduce operational cost, increase productivity and energy saving in line with company’s efforts towards electrification. there have been records of failure of electric drives in the past which have caused major production loss within petroleum nasional berhad (petronas) operations. common drives’ failure mechanisms are converter malfunction or electronic component failures, voltage dip susceptibility, insulation degradation and so on which could be avoided through effective preventive maintenance and condition-based monitoring via data analytics. this paper describes a methodology on electric drive health assessment (edha) and as a web-based data analytical tool to assess and monitor electric drives’ key components and parameters that contribute to a drive health index. based on the drive health index and corresponding risk, operators are able to closely monitor the condition of electric drives in their facility which will prompt them to carry out necessary intervention. edha was developed based on petronas installation, operation and maintenance practices, maintenance data and lessons learnt gathered from assets which have been operating for more than 30 years.","electric drives, motor, health index, digital tool","and Recommended Improvement Based on the development of EDHA as a digital tool, it will be an essential digital solution in supporting PETRONAS’ growth and sustainability agenda. The platform not only aims to improve drives’ reliability and prevent ad-hoc failures but also ensuring PETRONAS operating units align to each other in driving down the operational expenditures through integrated dashboards and optimizing maintenance intervals. Nevertheless, there are further improvements to the application. Generally, most of the drives installed do not subscribe to online condition-based monitoring as they are not equipped with measurement sensor. Integration with Internet of Things (IoTs) based sensors on drives and motors, artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms with EDHA platform will provide online parameters of the drives for better accuracy in predicting failure. This enhancement is crucial towards making the platform fit for future and scalable throughout PETRONAS operating units. As the journey towards digitalized asset management is being implemented across the globe, readiness of infrastructure backbone and effective cyber security policy are crucial to support the company’s digitalization agenda. The algorithm for electric drive analysis can be combined with diagnostics for induction motors, transformers, and switchgear; to provide an overview of the integrated machine and drive string with the aim of realizing an intelligent substation (David et al. 2021). Greater collaboration among technical society members and industry players on this cyber-security issue will foster the adoption of digital twin technology and cut the cost of ownership significantly.

43,Mixed-Integer Linear Programming Model For The Dualresource Flexible Job-Shop Scheduling Problem,"scheduling is a vital function for efficiently operating flexible job-shop systems. traditionally, that function considers assigning jobs to machines and their sequence. however, machines need to be operated by another set of resources (i.e., workers). due to the fact that operators are skilled workers, the available pool is limited. hence, the interaction of machines and humans needs to be studied in an integral manner to address the scheduling problem. in this article, a novel precedence variable-based, mixed-integer linear programming model is developed for the dual-resource flexible job-shop problem. the mathematical formulation deals with the optimal assignment of machines and workers to operations and the operation sequence in both resources by minimizing the makespan. the model gives an exact solution by solving both the assignment and the sequencing problems concurrently. the model was implemented in docplex and was run on three instances of varying sizes. the model solved the three introduced examples, including a large instance involving 20 operations with 4 workers and 4 machines, using only 1662 variables and 5217 constraints in 156.43 seconds, indicating that the proposed model is adequate. the model can be used to label training examples for machine learning-based techniques as well as help track and compare models developed using heuristics.","dual-resource, makespan, mathematical model","This study provides a novel MILP that offers an exact solution for DR-FJSP. The model is formulated using mixed integer and precedence variables and optimizes the total makespan. The model succeeded in providing optimal machine - worker assignments and schedules. Moreover, the model was tested on problems of various sizes, and their solutions were reported in the form of both machine and worker Gantt charts, along with their solving times. It is shown that this model uses a minimum number of variables to solve this problem, making it both simpler and faster. It is worth mentioning that the model does not use worker-machine eligibility sets; instead, a high processing time value is assigned for infeasible pairs. This can cause a problem if the size of the problem grows and the total makespan is comparable to the high value assigned for the infeasible pair. Hence, measures to deal with this problem need to be devised. Future research includes the development of efficient solution methods, such as metaheuristics, hyperheuristics, and the integration with machine learning. For instance, this model will provide optimal solutions for labeling training examples required in supervised machine learning models. Also, the model presented is uniform and unbiased towards the two kinds of resources. Therefore, this can be extended to formulate a general model for a multi-resource flexible job-shop scheduling problem.

44,Key Factors That Lead To Late Completion Of Government  Funded Construction Projects In South Africa,"project schedule overruns are a significant problem in south africa and globally. this research investigates the factors that cause the late completion of government funded construction projects in south africa and the mitigation measures that may be implemented to minimize the delays. the research is anchored in the project management book of knowledge (pmbok) as a theoretical framework and the research employed a quantitative research design. primary data was collected from built environment professionals registered with the south african council for project and construction management professionals through an online questionnaire survey. the results indicated that the top five ranked project delay factors include poor performance of contractors, labor unrest and strikes, slow decision- making, poor project planning and rework due poor quality. the top five mitigation measures noted by the respondents appeared in both the literature review and the pmbok framework, and include the use of competent contractors and professional service providers; securing project funding before the start of a project; proper project planning and the use of comprehensive project plans; the implementation of comprehensive change management systems, and effective stakeholder management.",schedule delays,"provides comparative review of the research findings and literature review to enable the researchers to answer the stated research questions. 5. Conclusion The researchers sought to identify key factors that lead to project delays of government-funded construction projects and the mitigation measures that can address and improve these delays. The literature review identified the key delay factors and mitigation measures from various global research studies, and studied the theoretical propositions of the PMBOK framework. In this section the research data and findings are analysed to respond to the two research questions “What are the key factors that lead to the late completion of government funded construction projects in South Africa?” and “What mitigation measures may be implemented in order to minimise construction delays in government funded construction projects South Africa?”. Interestingly, the only common factor found in both the literature review, and confirmed by the research respondents, was poor project planning. The respondents did not consider regular designs and scope changes, a client’s financial problems and late payment of contractors and service providers as constituting the top five factors that lead to the late completion of government funded construction projects in South Africa. Instead, the respondents stated that poor contractor performance, labour unrest and strikes, slow decision-making, and rework due to poor quality as being amongst the top five factors leading to project delay. Labour unrest and strikes is the only delay factor which was not present in the literature review and confirms that it is a unique factor in South Africa. Due to the close-ended nature of the questions, the research findings did not highlight the cause of labour unrests and strikes. The PMBOK framework suggests ten project management knowledge areas and five process groups to be used to mitigate delays (Alyad, 2017; Kerzner and Kerzner, 2017). For example, proper project planning and the use of comprehensive project plans are mitigation measures that appear in the literature review, the PMBOK framework and the research findings. The pattern suggests that this factor can reduce the risk of project delays. Respondents noted the following four factors identified in the literature review as mitigation measures that may be implemented to minimise construction delays in government funded construction projects in South Africa: • The use of competent contractors and professional service providers; • Securing project funding before the start of a project; • Proper project planning and the use of comprehensive project plans; and • The implementation of comprehensive change management systems. 92.57% 94.88% 93.75% 88.07% 85.72% 89.20% Proper project planning and the use of comprehensive project plans The use of competent contractors and professional service providers Securing project funding before the start of a project The implementation of proper procurement processes and policies The implementation of comprehensive change management systems Adopting adequate stakeholder management Q17 Q18 Q19 Q20 Q21 Q22 380","simangaliso hlengwa postgraduate school of engineering management university of johannesburg johannesburg, south africa simangahlengwa@gmail.com hannelie nel postgraduate school of engineering management university of johannesburg johannesburg, south africa hnel@tennelli.com","References

46,Implementation Of 5S And Its Impact: A University Case  Study,"the japanese 5s technique is one of the important lean manufacturing tools which can extensively help to enhance efficiency and productivity, reduce waste, and improve organizational culture. this paper reports a case of 5s implementation where one of the labs of a university was unorganized and subjected to inefficiency, long activity time, ineffective use of space, and excess inventory. 5s technique was implemented along with the input of safety as the 6th s, after having an initial study based on some preliminary data collection, discussion with lab technicians and students, and their analysis. the major objectives were to organize the workplace, remove unnecessary items and manage the inventory, and minimize the time required to perform tasks and activities in the laboratory. the 5s implementation was found impactful and changed the work culture to a great extent with the removal of unnecessary items and a managed inventory, orderliness, cleanliness, significantly lower activity time, and safety enhancement.","lean manufacturing, 5s, safety, time study","The main purpose of this research was to apply the concept of lean manufacturing to obtain a sustainable university. The lean manufacturing tool that was studied is the 5S methodology. From the findings and observations, it can be concluded that the laboratory that was not a safe space for occupants, have become organized, clean, and safe that greatly reduced the activity time, waste, and productivity and efficiency indirectly. The results of time study show that the activity time has been drastically reduced upto seven times, after 5S implementation. Implementing the 5S together with the 6thS which is safety has resulted in, elimination of unnecessary inventory, improved work flow and work performance, safety for occupants and an organized work space and a bigger storage density. Due to a great deal of insects and dust particles within the laboratory it can be recommended that the laboratory makes use of proper ventilation and effective insecticide. This study has shown that 5S is an excellent strategy to solve the problems within the university work area such as laboratory and workshop.

47,A Mini Review On Machining Of Aluminum  Rm Magabe,"in this article, a review of the available literature on the machining (specifically turning) of aluminum is systemically presented. through this work, a fundamental understanding of the machining of aluminum was developed together with the understanding of the effects of process parameters on machinability indicators. selected articles from the past two decades have been considered. turning of aluminum using different cutting tool inserts under different machining environments is presented. out of the literature discussed, some are based on the modelling and optimization of turning parameters to facilitate the machining of aluminum. overall, it can be concluded that since aluminum is a soft material and therefore difficult-to-machine, that necessitates various interventions like sustainable cooling and lubrication, tool treatment and texturing, and process optimization, to obtain the desired machinability.","aluminum, machinability, surface roughness","A brief review on machinability of aluminum under the influence of different machining conditions has been reported in this article. Since aluminum is a soft material, therefore it is difficult-to-machine and necessitates novel techniques of machining. Along with novelty, sustainability is also a major concern and has been taken care of by researchers in the form of successful dry and near-dry machining of aluminum. Prolonging the tool life by reducing tool wear is detrimental to the sustainability of the machining process. There are various methods of coating and texturing that have been explored but little work has been done to explore the advances in tooling together with advances in lubrication and cooling systems for aluminum machining. The combination of these techniques for sustainable machining allows room for research which can influence the way in which manufacturers operate. The use of microwave radiation for tool pre-treating before and after texturing presents a huge gap in research which is an important future research avenue.

48,"A Research Study On Surface Roughness, Corrosion Rate,  And Wire Erosion During Wedm Of Wc-Co Composites","tungsten carbide (wc) composites are specialized materials that have been found effective and useful for many industrial applications. this article reports the results of a research study conducted on wire electric discharge (wedm) of wc-co composites. effects of wedm parameters such as wire feed rate, voltage, pulse-on time, and pulse-off time on root mean square surface roughness of wc-co samples have been investigated by conducting twenty-nine experiments. process productivity in terms of material removal rate has also been investigated. it was found that the discharge energy is the key to obtain the desired surface quality during wedm of wc-co. sample machined at low discharge energy parameter setting has better surface roughness and corrosion resistance as compared to one machined at high discharge energy parameter combination at a compromise with the material removal rate. wire morphology study also confirms the suitability of low discharge energy parameter setting at which low wire erosion can be obtained.","erosion, composite, corrosion, surface roughness","The following conclusions are drawn from the present research: 1. In WEDM of WC-Co composites, discharge energy plays a prominent role to obtain the desired surface quality. High discharge energy combination/setting of parameters can lead to high productivity but at the cost of high wire erosion, and poor surface roughness; whereas low discharge energy setting of parameters produces low wire wear and better surface quality. 2. The variation of Rq with WEDM parameters indicates machining to be done at medium wire feed rate, medium servo voltage, medium pulse-off time, and low pulse-on time to obtain better surface quality characteristics. 3. The corrosion rate of WC-Co composite machined at low discharge energy parameter setting is 0.35067 mm/year which is 265% lower than that of the sample machined at high discharge energy parameters combination 0.92992 mm/year. 4. The outcomes evidenced the presence of a trade-off between quality and productivity while machining WC-Co composites using WEDM.

49,Green Cement Manufacturing In South Africa Through  Utilization Of Supplementary Cementitious Materials,"the continued increase in economies in most developing countries is associated with the requirements for construction materials such as cement and concrete. globally, cement production continues to increase further into year 2030 with expected increase to level that is 5 times year 1990, which is close to about 5 billion tones. manufacturing of cement is associated with emission of carbon dioxide (co2) during the clinker production process stage. there is further expectation that the cement industry is most probable to exceed the total amount of emissions of co2 of the emission standards. the industry in then under pressure to deploy strategies aimed at reduction of carbon dioxide and south african cannot afford to be left behind in reducing the co2 emission levels. utilization of supplementary cementitious materials (scms) (fly ash, ground granulated blast furnace slag and limestone) has been proven as one of strategic levers in manufacturing of cement at lower co2 emissions. to assess the south african industry’s implementation of this strategy, the types of cements being manufactured as guided by sans 5097-1 2013 and with respect to product offering to the market in terms of the formulation using raw materials in the manufacturing process were used for the evaluation purpose. the south african cement industry indicated to have 7 manufacturers that have integrated plants for producing cement thus associated with clinker production and 10 cement producers who manufacture cement by commencing the manufacturing process at the blending process stage. based on the market survey for the cement types being supplied in the market, the product offering ranged from cem i, cem iv and cem v which made use of fly ash, ggbfs and limestone for reduction of clinker factor. the percentage clinker substitution was as high in the range of 6 to 62. this indicated a potential co2 reduction of between 0.054 ton and 0.558 ton per 0.94 ton and 0.38 ton of clinker utilized in producing the cement respectively. although utilization of scms alone cannot be enough to reduce the emissions to 100% acceptable limits, the manufacturers were advised adopt additional potential decarbonization options such as decarbonization of the heat of burning through and carbon capture, utilization, and storage as additional co2 reduction strategies.","sans 5097-1 2013, co2, clinker","Based on the conducted cement supplier market assessment in South Africa, the transition of CO2 emission reduction through utilization of Supplementary Cementitious Materials was being fairly achieved. Though the percentage clinker substitution with SCM is of a certain threshold as per SANS 50197-1 as it affects the properties of cement being produced. There was a relationship between per-centage SCM usage for reducing clinker usage and CO2 emission. The relationship was based on what was known that 1 ton clinker production produces 0.9 ton CO2, thus per-centage amount of SCMs composition resulted with the same per-centage in CO2 emission reduction. The percentage clinker substitution with SCMs was as high as within a limit of 36% and 55% which reduced the CO2 emission between 0.576 ton and 0.405 ton respectively. Most manufacturers with integrated plants had cement types ranging from Portland composite cements (CEM II) to composite cements (CEM V), thus indicated the manufacturers’ commitment to reduce CO2 emissions. The third party cement blenders are reliant on SCMs in order to manufacture eco-blended cement , thus contributing to lower CO2 emission in the cement value chain. Conclusion was also drawn that other consumers of cement produced with the supplementary cementitious materials, benefit in their final products quality improvements such as increased durability and strength, reduced alkali-silica reactions and sulfate attack meanwhile reducing CO2 emission during production.","market assessment asser letsatsi tau, emmanuel innocents edoun, charles mbohwa and anup pradhan faculty of engineering and the built environment, school of mechanical engineering and industrial engineering department of quality and operations management university of johannesburg, 55 beit st, doornfontein, johannesburg, 2028, south africa gobetse.t@gmail.com, edounsen@hotmail.com, anupp@uj.ac.za and cmbohwa@yahoo.com",
50,Analysis Of Equipment Failure In A Production Line Of A  Coal Fly Ash Plant,"most manufacturers are striving to manage and improve their operations at the perspective of manufacturing costs. equipment failures and breakdowns should be kept at minimal as possible, thus to increase availability of equipment within a production line. a coal fly ash processing plant experienced continuous equipment breakdowns or failures which resulted in loss of production time. data was collected on a 31 days period to identify types of failures or breakdown and their frequency of occurrences, and time spent by maintenance personnel to rectify the failures. cause and effect diagrams were used in order to assess the causes that lead to overall effect of failures. it was identified that pipe conveyor belt failure was as a result of torn metallic structures, belt not fitting fully on idlers, deformed idlers and belt was unfolding at any point on the station while running. furthermore, pipeline leakages were also identified as contributing factors to failures. pareto chart was used to analyse the failures and it was identified that 80% of the pipe conveyor belt failure are caused by belt not fitting fully on idlers, torn metallic structure and deformed idlers, meanwhile 20% are caused as a result of belt unfolding at any point while running. meanwhile in the case of pipeline leakages, 80% of pipeline leakages caused by high coal fly ash operating flow rate and coal fly ash being corrosive which resulted with pipeline being torn, while 20% of the leaks were due to improper sealing on divetor valve. it was concluded that incorrect maintenance procedures lead to the overall continuous failures at the plant and recommendations were made which mainly emphasised the implementation of maintenance program.","fly ash, idlers","Based on the failures being identified and analysed through cause and effect diagram, pareto chart, it is clear that 80% of the pipe conveyor belt failures or breakdowns is due to operational challenges that are linked to maintenance of plant equipment in general. In the case of pipeline leakages, the failures were related to requirements of improving the productivity of equipment by operating at higher flow rates with coal fly ash being corrosive and this affecting the lifespan of the pipeline based on its material of construction which were prone to corrosion. 5. Recommendations Inspect and replace all torn idlers on the pipe conveyor belt station in order to minimise the rate of wear and tear due of the belt. Installation of additional idlers at the back of the idler station to assist the belt to fold and keep the piping structure/shape as is running. Welding of the structure groves to minimize belt damage as its running. The counter weigh needs to be at the required design for the belt to ran properly.","asser letsatsi tau, emmanuel innocents edoun, charles mbohwa and anup pradhan faculty of engineering and the built environment, school of mechanical engineering and industrial engineering department of quality and operations management university of johannesburg, 55 beit st, doornfontein, johannesburg, 2028, south africa gobetse.t@gmail.com, edounsen@hotmail.com, anupp@uj.ac.za and cmbohwa@yahoo.com",
51,How Digital Transformation Is Reshaping Supply Chains:  From Networks To Ecosystems,"although there has been a growing interest in the literature on supply chain ecosystems, there is still a lack of comprehensive understanding regarding ecosystems. there are gaps in knowledge, particularly in relation to the transformation of supply chains into ecosystems or their integration into existing ecosystems. while many academics advocate for supply chain networks to adopt an ecosystemic structure in order to increase their resilience and sustainability, there is a dearth of literature describing the precise procedures that enable the conversion of supply chains into ecosystems. the existing research indicates that a significant proportion, exceeding two-thirds of supply chain networks, encounter difficulties in transitioning into ecosystems. notwithstanding the potential advantages that supply chain networks could reap from transitioning into ecosystems, a gap in understanding persists regarding the process of such a transformation. there is a limited amount of literature available regarding the optimal integration of information technology within supply chains as well as the appropriate levels at which such integration should occur within business processes and decision-making. this study adopts a grounded theory perspective to investigate the manner in which supply chain networks within the healthcare supply chain in ghana expand their networks into ecosystems. the research focus has been directed towards the healthcare supply chain in ghana due to the current efforts towards digitization and platformization. these efforts aim to enhance the ecosystemic orientation of supply chain networks within the sector. the primary aim of this investigation is to examine the mechanisms through which supply chain networks evolve into supply chain ecosystems through digital transformation and integrative capabilities. the author employs a qualitative approach and a case study design to utilize snowball sampling in order to ascertain the supply chain network of selected healthcare facilities in ghana. the present study employs social network analysis and thematic analysis techniques to analyze the transcribed interviews to explore the transformation processes across supply chain networks and how they integrate technology.",ecosystems,,"evans amoah, david asamoah, kwame owusu kwateng and john serbe marfo department of supply chain and information systems - school of business kwame nkrumah university of science and technology kumasi, ghana evansamoah@knust.edu.gh, dasamoah.ksb@knust.edu.gh,kowusukwateng.ksb@knust.edu.gh, serbemarfo@knust.edu.gh francis andoh-baidoo full professor in the department of information systems the university of texas rio grande valley robert c. vackar college of business and entrepreneurship mcallen, texas, united states francis.andohbaidoo@utrgv.edu",
52,A Concise Systematic Literature Review For Cement  Manufacturing Decarbonization Options In South Africa,"literature reviews are important systematic ways of gathering relevant information on subject of interest. the emissions of carbon dioxide as one of the greenhouse gases during cement manufacturing impacts the environment through change in climate which results in temperature rises. globally, the cement industry is under pressure to implement practical measures for reduction of carbon dioxide emissions and achieving reduced emissions by 2030 and carbon emission neutrality by 2050. this means that mitigation measures need to be developed for reduction of carbon dioxide emissions for every ton of cement produced. the manufacturing strategies available includes decarbonization of heat (for kiln burning), decarbonization through supplementary cementitious materials, limestone calcined clay cement (lc3) production and carbon capture storage and utilization. the implementation of this strategies can be bring about strategic value by assisting in generating a framework for cement manufacturing with reduced carbon dioxide emissions and for long term, reducing unemployment rate. these strategies can be implemented within south african industry having noted that majority of cement manufacturers with integrated plants needs innovative ways of reducing emissions.","gases, emissions, climate","The use of alternative fuels has a potential of reducing waste from other industries that are intended to be send to landfills, for instance, hydrocarbon sludge and tyres that have reached end of use, while heat recovery from flue gas assist in reducing heat losses and emission directly to the environment and meanwhile the utilization of SMCs can assist with clinker factor reduction to a certain extend thereby reducing use of clinker which subsequently reduces amount of clinker production which is associated with carbon dioxide emissions. Carbon capture, storage and utilization also requires hectares of land and other carbon dioxide conversion technologies to various useful forms. Most Portland cement manufacturers that have integrated plants are situated in North-West province of South Africa where land is limited, making it challenging to adopt this option. 6. Recommendations Combination of these strategies within a cement plant can generate a framework which can be teste to reduce carbon dioxide emissions during cement production and subsequently converted into a patented model.","asser letsatsi tau, emmanuel innocents edoun, charles mbohwa and anup pradhan faculty of engineering and the built environment, school of mechanical engineering and industrial engineering department of quality and operations management university of johannesburg, 55 beit st, doornfontein, johannesburg, 2028, south africa gobetse.t@gmail.com, edounsen@hotmail.com, cmbohwa@yahoo.com and anupp@uj.ac.za",
53,An Explainable Artificial Intelligence Model For Project  Risk Assessment,"project management is essential for achieving objectives within specified timeframes, but real-world projects are prone to various risks that can impede progress. developing robust risk management systems can reduce associated costs and enable proactive risk mitigation. yet, current risk analysis methods struggle with modern project complexities, leading to the exploration of artificial intelligence (ai) techniques. ai, particularly machine learning, crafts predictive models from past data for precise risk assessment. but ai's opacity sparks transparency and fairness concerns. to address these, explainable ai (xai) enhances model interpretability. in project risk management, the incorporation of explainable ai (xai) techniques is crucial due to the socio-economic impact and ethical perspectives associated with each project, and stakeholders are responsible for ensuring that decision-making processes align with logical reasoning and conform to ethical perspectives. however, the popular xai technique, local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (lime), has limitations in capturing complex interactions and class imbalances. to address this, a novel approach integrates the variational autoencoder (vae) to generate meaningful samples and a rule-based decision tree model for complex interactions and nonlinearity. the expected contributions of the proposed study include improved interpretability and accuracy, handling complex models, and advancing xai techniques in project risk management. to accomplish these goals, the study begins by selecting instances for the explanation, generating synthetic neighbourhoods using vae, and fitting a rule-based decision tree model to capture complex interactions. this integrated approach strives to enhance interpretability, generate meaningful samples, and provide transparent explanations for informed risk strategies in project risk management.","interpretability, bangladesh",,"bodrunnessa badhon school of systems & computing unsw canberra at adfa canberra, act, australia b.badhon@adfa.edu.au ripon k. chakrabortty school of systems & computing unsw canberra at adfa canberra, act, australia r.chakrabortty@adfa.edu.au sreenatha anavatti school of eng & tech unsw canberra at adfa canberra, act, australia agsrenat@unsw.edu.au",

57,The Improvement Of Energy Utilisation In African  Breweries' Production Processes To Reduce Co2 Emissions,"the increasing global warming temperature has caused pressure on all manufacturing companies to reduce their production emissions. carbon dioxide (co2) remains the highest greenhouse gas that is emitted daily. the beer industry is among companies that utilise fossil fuels to generate energy for production. this study explores the energy efficiency improvement opportunities that exist in african breweries to reduce co2 emissions caused by beer production processes. to be able to identify improvement opportunities, the research determined the causes of high heat energy usage in the beer manufacturing process. quantitative and qualitative secondary data and records from 10 african breweries of company x were used to analyse the relationship that exists between heat energy utilisation and co2 emissions from breweries. high heat energy utilisation is caused by poor practices that exist in the breweries. the findings showed that when steam production has high boiler efficiency the total heat energy used will be reduced. the total steam usage by brewery processes and heat energy utilisation had a positive relationship. statistical analysis showed a strong correlation between both boiler efficiency and steam usage with co2 emissions for most of the breweries. the findings highlighted the importance of breweries being able to identify sources of heat energy inefficiencies. for sustainable improvements, capital investment into energy-saving technologies can be explored when energy wasters are eliminated.","energy efficiency, beer production, coal-fired boiler","and Recommendations 7.1. Conclusion of the study The purpose of this study was to understand how the causes of high heat energy usage impact the amount of CO2 emitted to the environment. The study did not only look at the production of steam by the boiler but also considered the usage of the produced steam by the beer processes. From the statistical analysis, the study was able to identify that boiler efficiency and steam usage have a strong correlation with the amount of CO2 released by the boiler during steam production. When breweries utilise a high amount of steam for beer production processes, that increases the kilograms of CO2 emitted. The global warming crisis increases the risk of human and animal deaths and natural disasters. It is the responsibility of all industries to implement technologies that will reduce the amount of CO2 they release. The study highlighted opportunities that exist in the beer industry that can be used to assist the current global warming crisis. 7.2. Recommendations for further research This research focused on the coal-fired boiler that produces steam, future research could study the heat energy usage for fuel types such as natural gas, biogas, and light-fuel oil to understand their impact on CO2 emissions. Breweries can utilise steam or hot water at very high temperatures for production and cleaning purposes, it is recommended that the two products be compared to understand how they can impact boiler efficiency, coal usage, and CO2 emissions. Breweries with implemented energy-saving technologies should be studied to further understand how technologies improve the total amount of CO2 that is emitted. The supply chain network for breweries also includes the transportation of raw materials and finished products. The amount of CO2 emitted by the mode of transport should be studied to understand the severity of its impact on carbon emissions. The research revealed a strong relationship between both boiler efficiency and steam usage to CO2 emissions. The causes of low boiler efficiency and high steam usage should be studied to identify solutions that can further improve heat energy utilisation.","precious mmofsoa and bernadette sunjka school of mechanical, industrial and aeronautical engineering university of witwatersrand (wits) johannesburg, south africa preciousmmofsoa@gmail.com bernadette.sunjka1@wits.ac.za",

However, due to the extensive use of water and medium costs, this technology is more effective for coal separation with near-dense material. The major impact of wet DMS technology is its significance to operations flowlines and management of slime dams, operations maintenance, and high management costs. The costs for putting up the dry FGX and DMS separation plant in SA have shown a significant difference in the capital cost as indicated in Table 7. The evaluation criteria of technology, innovations is the performance of the equipment to reach a criterion for quality and price. This research performed in SA coal has shown innovation adoption for using dry FGX separation technology for the production of Eskom products as an alternative to the wet DMS technology for producing Eskom products (CV values) of up to 21 MJ/kg The effect of selective mining and automation has a huge impact on job displacement thus South Africa needs to focus on creating new opportunities in the upstream sector, especially in the production of equipment used in mining operations such as truck fleets, excavators, crushers, and conveyor belts, and the chemical solutions used for extraction leaching processes. The emerging digital technologies in automated material characterization and online analysis can be built into the equipment and pre- programmed for specific mines in South Africa. The implementation of new technologies studies and investigation in the South African context is the much-needed answer to competitiveness improvement, coal quality, and the required expansion of coalfield usage and reduction of environmental pollution and CO2 emissions. The move towards a low-carbon growth trajectory and the realization of the potential of the Fourth Industrial Revolution enable systems of production and consumption to generate a clearer picture of how exactly the mining industry and the technological advancement, performance improvement of separate stages of coal processes and liquefaction products processing that significantly increases method efficiency is carried out in most countries",study nomsa sm mafodi and jan harm c pretorius postgraduate school of engineering management university of johannesburg south africa nomsam@gmail.com; jhcpretorius@uj.ac.za,

67,Revitalizing Healthcare Finances: Empowering Teams For  Smart Transformation Amidst Challenges,"healthcare organizations in the united states had significant financial difficulties following the covid-19 outbreak. these were made worse by the healthcare industry's fast-evolving workforce, which was influenced by years of physical and psychological stress on personnel and led to retirements, resignations, and relocations. the cost of operating for healthcare organizations increased as a result of the need for more adaptable working conditions, greater wages, and better benefits. in the beginning, the government's pandemic funding was frequently used to subsidize expensive temporary or contract labor as a response to the healthcare personnel shortage. healthcare organizations struggled with increasing labor costs and declining reimbursement rates when these funds ran out and inflationary pressures remained. this article describes a complete 6-week program held from july 6 to august 11, 2023, within a community-based healthcare system, to educate and empower clinical and operational teams in problem-solving and financial responsibility. five guiding concepts (pillars) were used by the sustainable management above reimbursement transformation (smart) initiative to direct cost-cutting activities: practice efficiency, access improvement, working differently, expense reductions, and revenue generation. the goal of an advisory panel supported by sub-teams was to find areas for improvement without sacrificing patient care while evaluating cost- saving targets and suggested measures for various service areas. with an average predicted cost savings of 13% across service lines, the outcomes exceeded expectations. this successful initiative represents a significant stride toward financial sustainability in healthcare institutions, demonstrating the resilience and adaptability of healthcare providers during challenging economic times and offering valuable lessons for the future.","covid-19, finance, healthcare","No sector including healthcare is unstirred from the impact of the global pandemic (COVID-19) especially in the financial realm. This study which was conducted in a community-based hospital in a rural midwestern region showed that a structured team-based approach can be fruitful in bringing different functional groups (departments and clinical areas) on the same page in a time of difficulty in a very brief timeline. The outcome of the final implementation of the proposed improvements is yet to be seen but the proposed improvements can be taken as a positive sign to setting a positive tone within the organization within the clinical areas through the highest level of leadership.

69,Determining The Factors Responsible For Affecting Impact  Strength Of A Carbon Fibre 3-D Printed Specimen Using,"the utilization of carbon fiber 3d printed specimens is progressively expanding across various applications that need exceptional levels of strength and stiffness. nevertheless, the impact strength of these specimens may be influenced by several parameters, including carbon fiber content, infill pattern, density, printing speed, and layer thickness. this research study uses the design of experiments (doe) methodology to examine the parameters that influence the impact strength of carbon fiber 3d printed specimens. a statistical model has been established to forecast the impact strength of carbon fiber 3d printed specimens, taking into consideration the elements. the study's findings indicate that the impact strength of carbon fiber 3d printed specimens is mostly influenced by the infill density in comparison to other parameters. the impact strength is significantly influenced by the interaction effects of layer thickness, infill pattern, and infill density. the statistical model created in this research may be used to ascertain the most suitable amalgamation of variables to get the intended level of impact strength for a certain application. this phenomenon has the potential to enhance the overall performance, longevity, and safety attributes of many items.","carbon fibre, impact testing, 3-d printing","Upon the successful completion of the experimentation and data analysis, three main key insights were observed: 1. With the experiment carried out, it is evident that Infill Density stands out as the sole main effect parameter with significant influence on the response. This significance is likely attributed to the fact that as density increases, approaching its maximum value of 100%, the part transitions to a completely solid state. Consequently, the importance of the other two factors hinges upon the chosen infill density. 2. Secondly, all of the two-way interaction effects, namely Layer Thickness - Infill Density, Layer Thickness - Infill Pattern, and Infill Density - Infill Pattern, prove to be noteworthy factors in affecting the response. 3. The experiment reveals that the maximum response value, indicating the maximum energy required to fracture the part, is achieved when employing a layer thickness of 150 µm, an infill pattern of gyroid, and an infill density of 50%. These findings collectively contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the experimental outcomes.","design of experiments shubham parekh1, pawan bhandari, ph.d.1 and praneel acharya, ph.d.2 1department of automotive & manufacturing engineering technology, 2department of mechanical engineering, minnesota state university mankato, mn 56001, usa shubham.parekh@mnsu.edu; pawan.bhandari.2@mnsu.edu; praneel.acharya@mnsu.edu",

73,Research On A Movable Microcontroller-Based Four-Legged  Walking Robot System,"in this study, a four-legged walking robot with legs is selected so that it can be applied to different surfaces, and studies on gait, structure and control were reviewed, with a greater emphasis on stable walking. what is important about walking is to ensure stability so that the center of gravity (or zmp) is within the polygon formed by the legs supporting the ground. for this purpose, a mathematical model for kinematics and inverse kinematics suitable for the robot's leg joints was established. the motion trajectories of the torso and each foot were generated using third or higher order functions, and the angular values of each leg joint were obtained through their relative motion and an inverse kinematics model programmed in matlab. the angular value obtained as above was applied to adams, a dynamics simulation software, in the form of a spline. the adams model used at this time was constructed by importing 3d cad catia data from an actual produced dog-shaped robot, creating constraints and joints for each joint and providing contact relationships between the toes and the ground. adams simulation results confirmed that the planned walking pace was sufficiently stable. these gait patterns were again applied to the robot itself to confirm its walking ability, and the distance sensor was installed to improve the robot's navigation ability by equipping it with obstacle detection and response capabilities.","adams, 3d cad, robot","Existing research results on four-legged walking were examined and analyzed. Based on the walking of four-legged animals, a stable robot walk was developed and verified through simulation. In addition, an experimental four-legged walking robot system was fabricated and experiments were conducted on basic movements such as walking, obstacle detection and reaction. When planning the movement of the toe based on the movement of an animal, it is very important to use a smooth curve with a cubic function or more, and when building a mathematical model to calculate the exact joint, derive an inverse kinematic solution angular value corresponding to the path the toe This has been confirmed. Meanwhile, the plan was to achieve the animal's general duty factor by designing the running patterns to go forward and forward. The walking movement was planned assuming that the robot's body moves parallel to the ground. On the other hand, the dynamic analysis includes friction with the substrate and there is slippage on the contact surface. The stability was predicted by kinematic analysis and the stability of the stage was checked by dynamic simulation of the pattern created on this basis. This showed that stability prediction was possible by comparing kinematic analysis and dynamic analysis. The manufactured four-legged robot has the advantage of being small, cheap and easy to manufacture, but especially the RC servo motor for joint drive has the disadvantage of insufficient position and speed control. In the future, there is a need for research in the field of running technology that can move autonomously to the destination while avoiding obstacles through the use of faster and more sophisticated DC servo motors and PC-based control units.","yeonju lee, shin dong ho student and professor, my paul school 12-11, dowontongmi-gil, cheongcheon-myeon, goesan-gun chungcheongbuk-do, republic of korea eavatar@hanmail.net jeongwon kim department of economics, college of economics, nihon university 3-2 kanda-misakicho, 1-chome, chiyoda-ku, tokyo, japan shinphys@naver.com",
74,Research On Face Recognition System Using Wavelet  Analysis,"recently, the importance and usability of facial recognition technology has gained more attention over time. applications include access control, attendance management system, e-commerce, financial transactions, atm, online banking user authentication system, electronic payment system and airport search. it is used in various fields such as systems, web user authentication systems, intelligent video surveillance devices, computer security and information security systems. facial recognition technology is superior in terms of ease of use because it requires no special contact or action from the user and has the advantage of being able to perform a surveillance function by storing facial images. a representative method for face recognition is the principal components analysis (pca) algorithm. however, facial recognition technology uses a person's face as biometric information, so it is very complex and has many variables such as diversity of facial information and lighting conditions, so there is a problem of low recognition speed. in this paper, we use wavelet analysis to implement a face recognition system that is robust to the diversity of face information and illumination of the traditional principal component analysis method. to evaluate the performance of a face recognition system using wavelet transform and principal component analysis, a comparative analysis is performed using the traditional principal component analysis method and the fisher linear discriminant analysis method. the recognition speed is improved by changing the image data for wavelet analysis to conditions that are robust to light and facial expressions. experiment and simulation results show that wavelet transform and principal component analysis methods show a more stable improvement rate for face recognition than the traditional pca method.","heart rate, personality, big5, deep learning",,"benny choi, shin dong ho student and professor, my paul school 12-11, dowontongmi-gil, cheongcheon-myeon, goesan-gun chungcheongbuk-do, republic of korea eavatar@hanmail.net jeongwon kim student, department of economics, college of economics, nihon university 3-2 kanda-misakicho, 1-chome, chiyoda-ku, tokyo, japan shinphys@naver.com",

76,Eco-Efficiency Consideration For Investment Portfolio  Determination Via An Advanced Decision Architecture,"in recent decades, there has been a notable surge in eco-friendly investments among prospective and current market participants. it has now evolved into an imperative standard for contemporary business decision-making. the critical challenge lies in the adept selection of investment portfolios that can effectively address both sustainability and profitability concomitantly. this task inherently involves a multi-dimensional nature, necessitating the consideration of various, sometimes conflicting, metrics. consequently, this study proposes an advanced decision-making framework that amalgamates data envelopment analysis (dea) with artificial intelligence (ai). in contrast to prior research, which predominantly focused on determining investment portfolios based solely on target profitability, this study extends its purview to encompass sustainability considerations. this expansion aligns with the prevailing business trend that prioritizes fostering an eco-friendly atmosphere. while the dea-based approach has demonstrated its supremacy in performance evaluation, it exhibits a notable limitation – a dearth of forecasting capability. to address this limitation, we introduce the extreme learning machine (elm), an ai methodology renowned for its superior predictive capacity. this integration is inspired by ensemble learning principles, aimed at harnessing complementary insights from diverse contributing models. through the incorporation of this model, the role of market participants undergoes a profound transformation, shifting from retrospective and current monitoring to proactive future planning.","sustainability, eco-efficiency","This study introduces an innovative investment portfolio selection strategy that integrates DEA and AI techniques by considering financial and sustainable indicators. The results show that the investment portfolio selection strategy that considers the sustainable indicator performs better than the strategy without considering the sustainable indicator. Users can thus consider the potential implication of formulating a future investment strategy as well as maximizing their personnel wealth through this model.

77,Assessing Hazard Level Perception Of Colors: A  Comparative Study With Ansi Recommendations,"every year, a significant number of people are injured while using products in their homes or as a result of their misuse, emphasizing the importance of risk communication. the purpose of this study is to assess the consistency of color perception and hazard rating among male and female participants in pakistan with american national standards institute (ansi) recommendations. undergraduate students from various academic backgrounds participated in the study. the findings show that color perception and hazard rating differed between male and female participants. participants showed significant mean differences when comparing colors, with some colors rated as more dangerous than others. surprisingly, the perceived hazard ratings generally matched ansi recommendations. however, there were some inconsistencies, especially in the differentiation of certain colors. notably, neither male nor female participants distinguished significantly among ""blue"", ""green"", and ""yellow."" females did not distinguish significantly between ""blue vs. orange."" males, on the other hand, did not perceive ""green and orange"" as significantly different. in addition, they (males) did not significantly distinguish between ""yellow and orange"", and similarly they did not perceive a significant difference between ""red and black."" both (male and female) participants perceived red as the most hazardous. however, female participants provided lower scores as compared to male participants. these findings offer valuable insights into the complexities of color perception and its implications for warning label design. these results underscore the need for further research to better understand the relationship between color perception, cultural influences, and hazard communication, particularly in the context of product safety.","hazard, perception, color","This study investigated the perception of warning colors within the context of Pakistani culture and its implications for hazard levels, with the goal of aligning these perceptions with the ANSI recommendations. The findings provide useful information about how Pakistanis interpret warning colors on product labels. Color had a significant impact on participants' perceived hazard ratings regardless of gender. Notably, the perceived hazard levels closely matched ANSI's recommendations in ANSI Z535.4, where the colors Yellow, Orange, and Red are used in ascending order to represent increasing levels of hazard. Certain color pairs, however, did not show significant differences in perception, unfolding the complex interplay of cultural elements and individual preferences in designing perceptions of warning colors. These cultural differences in color perception highlight the importance of different cultural backgrounds and individual perspectives on how colors are associated with hazard levels. Integrating these suggestions into future research endeavors has the potential to make significant contributions to the development of more impactful and culturally tailored product warning labels. Such efforts would, in turn, improve consumer safety and comprehension not only in Pakistan but also on a larger scale. Furthermore, the findings of this study will be critical in guiding Pakistan in the formulation of product warning labels, which is a highly concerned missing aspect in the Pakistani context. The study presented the findings for one critical factor, the color of product warning labels. Other discrete components, such as symbols, signal words, and their combinations, should also be investigated in order to gain a comprehensive understanding of creating impactful warning labels that cater to the cultural and anthropological needs of the Pakistani population. Acknowledgment We are also thankful to our respondents who gave precious data and time on a critical topic that has shaped the article. 721","miskeen ali gopang phd scholar and lecturer department of industrial engineering and management miskeen.gopang@faculty.muet.edu.pk tauha hussain ali professor department of civil engineering mehran university of engineering and technology, jamshoro-76062-sindh, pakistan tauha.hussain@faculty.muet.edu.pk shakeel ahmed shaikh associate professor department of industrial engineering and management mehran university of engineering and technology, jamshoro-76062-sindh, pakistan shakeel.shaikh@faculty.muet.edu.pk","References

79,Efficiency And Feasibility Analysis Of A Renewable Energy  Generation System Based On Piezoelectric Principle,this research analyzes the possibility of generating renewable energy from the kinetic energy generated by people walking on tiles equipped with piezoelectric sensors. the main objective is to determine the efficiency of this system and its ability to reduce conventional electrical energy consumption. the study is based on a review of existing literature and the construction of a piezoelectric tile prototype. tests and measurements are performed to evaluate the power generation and improvements in the prototype design are proposed. the results show that the system is feasible and that the power generation is adequate to cover the electrical energy demand in a specific environment. it is concluded that the implementation of this system can be cost-effective and beneficial to reduce conventional energy consumption.,"renewable energy, clean energy, piezoelectric","To conclude, it is determined that the application of the prototype under study is feasible because the test and confirmation of positive results in the analysis of the objectives are achieved. Regarding the main objective, after comparing the results of the three runs. It is concluded that the first case has an efficiency of 316.4 volts per person, which allows covering in its totality the demand of KW for the ""Multicenter Benavides"". Similarly, it can be concluded, based on the results of the specific objectives, the feasibility of the implementation, since the cost of conventional energy consumption is wholly eliminated since the capacity of kW generation per month is greater than what is consumed monthly in the market. Finally, a cost-benefit of 1.3 is obtained. This means that for each tile invested for ten years, there will be a return of 1.3.","enma arias-pacheco and claudia lucho-alvarez bachelor of science in industrial engineering faculty of engineering, industrial engineering career, universidad de lima, perú 20171853@aloe.ulima.edu.pe, 20170869@aloe.ulima.edu.pe, juan carlos quiroz-flores professor researcher faculty of engineering, industrial engineering career, universidad de lima, perú jcquiroz@ulima.edu.pe",
80,Utilization Of Soybean Hulls In Paper Production  Ana Arévalos And Jorge Rodas,"in paraguay, the opportunity to use soybean hulls in paper production stands out thanks to its cellulose content (around 40%). therefore, the most economically convenient process has been identified in this work providing an estimated cost per tonne of paper pulp obtained from soybean hulls, in order to be installed in paper industries seeking to expand their product portfolio. the methodology adopted was based on a bibliographic review that allowed the theoretical analysis of soybean hulls characteristics as a raw material in paper production and the analysis of cellulose extraction processes from agro-industrial waste. using only 6% of the total soybean hulls produced in the country in one year (203,566 t), a profit of us$ 1.6 million will be obtained at a sales price of us$ 775/t, making its economic value higher when it’s used in paper production than in exportation or animal feeding.","soybean hulls, agro-waste, paper pulp, cellulose","The literature review allowed to identify methods for Soybean hulls utilization. Process studied by Carvajal et al. (2016) stands out as the most convenient in economic and efficiency terms. In combination with a reagent recovery system of 85%, more than 40% of yield is expected at a cost of 484 US$/t of cellulose extracted from soybean hulls. The utilization of soybean hulls in paper production could reduce the costs associated with importing cellulose pulp for paper production, which currently amount to US$4 million per year locally. A pulp production’s line setup at a cost of US$ 484/t, using only 6% of the total amount of hulls produced in Paraguay in a year (203,566 t), would generate US$ 1.6 million of profit at a sale price equal to US$ 775 and having a higher economic value than the hulls exported or used as animal feed. It is expected that the valorization of this residue will generate a positive socioeconomic impact in Paraguay. With the 40% of available hulls utilization, about 48,000 tonnes of wood and more than 330,000 m3 of water would be saved. For future work, there is a need to characterize Paraguayan soybean hulls to determine the real amount of cellulose that can be extracted from them, along with the costs and benefits that their extraction implies.","laboratorio de control de procesos, departamento de ingeniería industrial facultad de ingeniería – universidad nacional de asunción. san lorenzo, paraguay aarevalos@fiuna.edu.py eduardo redondo laboratorio de optimización, departamento de ingeniería industrial facultad de ingeniería – universidad nacional de asunción. san lorenzo, paraguay eredondo@ing.una.py andrea insfran-rivarola laboratorio de producción y métodos, departamento de ingeniería industrial facultad de ingeniería – universidad nacional de asunción. san lorenzo, paraguay andrea.insfran@ing.una.py regina león departamento de ingeniería industrial facultad de ingeniería – universidad nacional de asunción. san lorenzo, paraguay rleon@ing.una.py",
81,Assessing The Factors Influencing Productivity In Steel  Manufacturing Industries,"low productivity is a persistent challenge in diverse industries, necessitating ongoing efforts to identify and rectify its underlying causes. factors influencing productivity, such as workplace conditions and management practices, are of paramount importance. this study focuses on the crucial steel industry, which plays a foundational role in the economic development of the united arab emirates (uae), serving as a catalyst for numerous associated businesses. the primary objective is to conduct an in-depth exploration of the factors affecting productivity within the uae's steel industry. this research aims to comprehensively identify these factors, assess their relative significance, and evaluate their impacts using the analytic hierarchy process (ahp) as a decision-making methodology to provide insights that can empower productivity improvement initiatives and enhance the overall efficiency of the steel manufacturing system. according to the outcomes of the research, visionary management (with a weightage of 24.28%), government policies and regulations (16.75%), and financial stability (12.60%) are important factors for productivity improvement in steel manufacturing industries.",,"In conclusion, productivity is a crucial factor that significantly impacts living standards. Our choice to focus on the steel industry among various sectors was motivated by its role as the cornerstone for numerous everyday objects, including electronics, bridges, machinery, and various devices. This project aimed to identify and analyze the factors influencing productivity in the steel industry, with each factor bearing substantial importance. To fulfill the project's objective of assessing the determinants of productivity in steel manufacturing, we exclusively utilized the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP). Through AHP, we established scales and determined the most favorable alternatives based on expert opinions from Emirate steel companies. The results highlight that visionary management holds the highest criteria weight among all factors, signifying its paramount importance. As indicated in Table 4, factors like energy saving, manpower, skill requirements, and technology were found to have relatively lower impacts on productivity. Conversely, visionary management and government policies and regulations emerged as the most influential factors. In summary, our analysis using the AHP methodology consistently identifies visionary management as the predominant driver of productivity, followed by the influence of government policies and regulations. Steel industry leaders and policymakers should prioritize these factors to enhance productivity, complemented by the implementation of robust control plans and strategies.","mariam alzaabi and noura alhammadi bachelor student, department of industrial engineering technology, higher colleges of technology, abu dhabi, united arab emirates h00413600@hct.ac.ae; h00385349@hct.ac.ae sasikumar perumal faculty, department of industrial engineering technology, higher colleges of technology, abu dhabi, united arab emirates skumar2@hct.ac.ae",
82,Investment Cost Analysis And Quality Control Of Telco  Products At Pt Xyz Using Fmea Method And Kaizen,"pt xyz is one of the renowned printing industries in indonesia. one of the main products of pt xyz is security printing, where the production process is located in the smart card department. the fluctuating production quantity necessitates that the company is capable of implementing an optimal production process to achieve high-quality outcomes, as well as ensuring the effective and efficient operation of the production process. the issue at pt xyz is the persistent occurrence of product failures or defects that are difficult to avoid, leading to a product quality that has not yet met the company's expected standards. hence, it is evident that the existing issues necessitate improvement, which will be conducted using a method suitable for production quality control, namely the failure mode and effect analysis (fmea) method. in addition, improvements can also be made with other supporting concepts such as the kaizen concept and the five-step plan or 5s (seiri, seiton, seiso, seiketsu, and shitsuke) concept. this research concludes that it can generate alternative improvement while considering the company's investment feasibility aspects, thereby reducing defects in the production of telco products at pt xyz.","quality control, kaizen","The conclusions drawn from the research conducted at PT XYZ are as follows: 1. During the production process of Telco products in the period of August to September 2022, four dominant defects were identified in the Smart Card department at PT XYZ. These defects include 9,931 reject printings, 6,972 ATR dead units, 5,227 one-sided card bodies without a chip, and 2,288 bad implants. 2. The most influential failure mode causing defects in the most dominant Telco product in the Smart Card department at PT XYZ, with the highest Risk Priority Number (RPN), is the suboptimal machine setting failure mode. This is caused by the potential failure factor of operator precision. The calculated Risk Priority Number (RPN) based on an interview with the quality control leader is 120 RPN. 3. Proposed suggestions for consideration include providing shelves for storing operator equipment in the workspace, distinguishing between necessary and unnecessary items to prevent clutter in the workspace, allocating specific boxes for different types of equipment, particularly in the sorting or quality control area, conducting a 5-minute cleaning before and after work processes, providing dedicated bags for disposing of rejected products in the sorting area, and assigning specialized personnel for workspace cleaning, not solely relying on operators or related workers. 4.

85,"Time Frames, Variables, And Performance Metrics  Consideration In Renewable Energy Prediction Models: A","renewable energy has gained immense attention due to its potential to reduce the world's dependency on fossil fuels and mitigate climate change. as the energy harnessing rate from renewable sources depends on some external parameters like solar radiation, wind speed, direction, and turbulence, the generation rate in such sources comes with a high level of fluctuations. fluctuations in their output can increase operating costs for the electricity system and be quite challenging for utility companies to always maintain a proper balance between the generation and usage of electricity. to reduce the operation cost and increase the reliability of the system, robust forecasting models are used to predict the generation rate and energy demand. this review paper offers a thorough examination of cutting-edge data-driven forecasting models utilized in forecasting renewable energy generation and demand. the paper organizes previous studies into five distinct groups based on prediction time frame: immediate, very short-term, short-term, medium-term, and long-term. it subsequently assesses the performance of various forecasting models, including three primary categories: time series, machine learning, and ensemble models, concerning predicting energy demand and generation rates across different time frames, using standard performance evaluation metrics. the findings indicate that ensemble models employing neural networks and support vector machines demonstrate notably higher accuracy rates in predicting energy demand and generation rates compared to the other models.","forecasting, machine learning, time series",,"review omid motamedisedeh and azharul karim school of mechanical, medical, and process engineering, faculty of engineering queensland university of technology 2 george st, brisbane city, qld, 4000, australia omid.motamedisedeh@hdr.qut.edu.au azharul.karim@qut.edu.au",
86,Driving Forces Shaping The Future Of Urban Logistics:  Insights From A Foresight Exercise In Singapore,"urban logistics is an extremely important and yet disturbing activity for cities. on the one hand, it plays a key role in the development of cities by distributing goods to retail, commercial establishments, and homes. on the other hand, its operations negatively impact the environment, economy, and society in general. in addition, urban logistics is a complex and evolving system shaped by various uncertainties and driving forces. its development cannot be projected by simply extrapolating past and current trends. foresight exercises help planners and stakeholders identify key drivers of change, including trends, challenges, and technologies, that might effectively shape the future. this paper presents insights from an ongoing foresight study on the future of urban logistics in singapore. preliminary findings in our environmental scanning indicate that e-commerce, decarbonisation, regulatory measures, parcel lockers, and cycle logistics are the dominant future drivers of change in the urban logistics landscape in singapore. regarding technology, autonomous vehicles, delivery robots, green vehicles, drones, and tracking technology are seen as potential game-changers for singapore's future urban logistics.","urban logistics, drivers of change, future, foresight",,"ei myat kay khine centre for applied research singapore university of social sciences, singapore eimyat@suss.edu.sg seyed mehdi zahraei school of business singapore university of social sciences, singapore zahraei@suss.edu.sg sougotam ghosh school of business singapore university of social sciences, singapore sougotam@suss.edu.sg",
87,Designing Sustainable Energy Efficient Buildings Through  Passive Strategies,"expected to surge, around 30% of the world's final energy consumption is in the building industry. such a figure shows how important is the role of this sector in energy demand and supply. governments have tried to encourage designers and clients to move toward low energy building designs through incentives like subsidies and tariffs. in line with this trend several solutions have been proposed in both academia and industry. however, a conclusive pathway that can highlight the suitable sustainable energy efficient design is yet to be investigated. the main key to reach this goal might lay in the concept of ‘vernacular architecture’ that focuses on the local style or indigenous designing pathways. such a concept falls within the passive design solutions that have long been discussed in many studies to not only reduce energy consumption in the building industry but reaching sustainability. the importance of integrating this concept in building energy demand reduction is to consider building energy designs beyond the general regulations and seek the answers in the past design mindsets. it should be noted that in the olden days when the heating, ventilation and air conditioning (hvac) systems were not developed, people used to design their buildings in a way that was most adapted to the local environment and could harness its powers in the favor of providing the heating and cooling demand. one of the well-known systems that was invented thousands of years ago is the wind-catcher structures. this magnificent design provided cooling energy without any need for the modern hvac systems. with all said, the main solution in building energy consumption reduction lies in passive design strategies by integrating vernacular architecture concept in energy designs.","passive design, sustainability",,mehdi gholami rostam phd student school of engineering and information technology university of new south wales (unsw) m.gholami_rostam@adfa.edu.au dr. alireza abbasi senior lecturer school of engineering and information technology university of new south wales (unsw) a.abbasi@adfa.edu.au,
88,Simulation Of Clinical Laboratory Process Improvement  Based On Iso 15189 Standard,"the clinical analysis laboratory plays a crucial role in the diagnosis and prevention of diseases, consequently, the results of the examinations must be issued under optimal conditions of quality and precision that allow safe medical decisions to be supported. accreditations such as iso 15189 are instruments that allow laboratories to ensure, through their criteria and characteristics, results that meet quality standards, ensure traceability, and have high reliability, furthermore, the analysis and application of this standard contribute to the continuous improvement and optimization of resources in clinical laboratories, which generates greater productivity in the processes. in the present investigation, a simulation model of the laboratory service process in a medical center was designed to which proposed improvements were applied considering the evaluated criteria of the iso 15189 standard. the simulation model was developed in the arena software and executed the initial system model and the one proposed for comparison, where the processing time of patient care capacity in the laboratory was increased by 33%, achieving an increase from 12 to 16 clinical analyses performed per day. likewise, the improvement in laboratory efficiency is directly related to the 32.3% increase in the medical center's monthly income from the tests performed in its laboratory. this demonstrates that implementing the iso 15189 standard can generate positive impacts that only translate into the quality of the service but also the profitability of the laboratories.","clinic laboratory, iso 15189, simulation","In the research, the ISO 15189 Standard was analyzed to propose possible changes in the laboratory service of the medical center under study to achieve improvements in the process. By simulating the model in the Arena software, it was possible to visualize the procedures carried out during the laboratory service through a practical animation; Furthermore, with this, it was possible to verify that the proposed changes to the selected processes can generate positive results which provide useful information for future decisions within the laboratory. The proposed and simulated model presented favorable results by showing a decrease in the length of stay of patients within the laboratory, which allows for a greater number of samples to be taken in one day, which is directly related to the increase in the income of the medical center; In addition, the change in processes also resulted in optimization of resources through the decrease in the utilization rate of laboratory personnel, which can have a positive impact on their work performance. Although the process model proposed in the research can provide certain suggestions to obtain better results in the laboratory service, the study has some limitations that can be developed to complement the research, such as the performance of the laboratory staff, who have different types of experience and skills that can impact their development. Also, the wear generated during workdays can be considered, which has effects on productivity at work. In this case, staff performance was assumed to be constant without any variation among participants in the process.","alexia valery bazán rodríguez and gabriela noelí tapia alfaro universidad de lima, carrera de ingeniería industrial lima, perú 20173085@aloe.ulima.edu.pe; 20173934@aloe.ulima.edu.pe josé antonio taquía gutiérrez universidad de lima, carrera de ingeniería industrial lima, perú jtaquia@ulima.edu.pe",

This option should be exercised in a short period of time (temporary). The proposed alternative is building a new warehouse on PT XYZ's internal land, building a new warehouse on new land, or continuing to rent the warehouse. The results of the investment feasibility analysis, found that the option of building a warehouse on PT XYZ's internal land is the best alternative because it requires the smallest investment value of IDR 115,027,949,163, the largest NPV value is – IDR 133,789,477,582, the smallest EUAC value is IDR 32 ,916,272,389, the smallest Cost-Effective Analysis value is IDR 6,724 per ton, and the Cost-Benefit Analysis value is 0.8017. In this way, minimal storage costs are obtained. Hence, alternative B is the best alternative whether PT XYZ planned to gain profit in the future by selling their property and costs about IDR 1,727,603,929,435.","equivalent uniform annual of cost method ervizal buana jatiputra undergraduate student faculty of engineering universitas sebelas maret (uns) surakarta, indonesia ervizal14@student.uns.ac.id wahyudi sutopo industrial engineering department, faculty of engineering universitas sebelas maret (uns) surakarta, indonesia wahyudisutopo@staff.uns.ac.id",

94,Influential Criteria For Large-Scale Factory And Warehouse  Main Contractor Selection Used For End-To-End,"based on prior research, it was found that only a limited number of studies have addressed approaches for enhancing procurement management involving the selection of factory and warehouse construction contractors, along with the control of contractor construction efficiency. furthermore, the decision-making process in contractor selection was frequently delegated to the procurement department or an individual within the department, potentially introducing personal biases. consequently, contractors who submitted the lowest bids often secured projects, particularly in fiercely competitive industries. relying primarily on cost-based decisions may lead to the selection of less qualified and less suitable contractors. this research aims to provide relevant criteria for selecting main contractors for factory and warehouse construction projects with areas greater than 10,000 square meters (sq.m). this is to reduce the risk of low-quality work or construction job abandonment. to not based purely on cost, supplier selection process is a multi- criteria decision making (mcdm) process. the proposed evaluation criteria are analyzed using analytic hierarchy process (ahp) technique, data were collected from seventeen experienced experts in the field of factory and warehouse construction contractor selection to ensure result reliability. it was found that the decision-makers gave the past and present performance of the construction contractor performance factor as the first priority with a relative weight of 0.32. this is followed by operational technique at 0.19, staff at 0.18, financial at 0.17, and lastly, partner relationship at relative weight of 0.16. the relative importance weights were later used in a large-scale factory and warehouse contractor selection process as a case example. using conjunctive method with three inclusion criteria, five alternatives were shortlisted from a total of 40 companies. as a result, company e received the highest score was chosen as the construction contractor of choice. the study also revealed that certain critical decision-making criteria, such as management expertise and technical proficiency, frequently lack sufficient available data, requiring the acquisition of this information directly from contractors. therefore, it likely is inadequate for risk assessment and perhaps efficient scoring when selecting alternatives. consequently, an end-to-end procurement risk management process is also proposed utilizing the top three relatively significant criteria to develop a tool for monitoring contractor performance during operations. additionally, implementing a vendor checklist for their inclusion in the annual supplier list is also recommended.","contractor, supplier selection","The analysis of gathered research data from 17 experts using AHP approach results in the relative weight of importance of proposed five criteria and their sub-criteria for MCDM of large-scale factory or warehouse construction contractor selection to ensure that procurement department does not selects contractor focusing merely on cost. The authors apply proposed criteria in a case example on select the suitable main contractor for construction projects of factories and warehouses, and alternative that meets the requirements the most gained the highest score is Company E. Company E is efficient in terms of past and present performance of the construction contractor which is an important criterion that is first and foremost used as a major decision criterion. Moreover, the company does lack in other criteria as well, it makes Company E appear to be reliable to win the project and expected to be able to complete the project as planned. Furthermore, this research identified certain vital factors for contractor selection that face challenges in data collection, specifically in terms of information related to project management expertise and construction technical proficiency. Since this information is pivotal for gauging reliability and efficient management expertise, its absence from each bidding company's presentation can obscure potential project shortcomings. This, in turn, hinders decision-makers from obtaining adequate information to assess risks and score operational technical aspects. Subsequently, an end-to- end procurement risk management process is also proposed using top three relative important criteria, with ""performance"" and ""current contractor construction workload"" being the first and foremost. The second and third ranked criteria, ""operational technique"" and ""staff,"" are essential components as well. This approach is aimed at developing tools for ongoing contractor performance monitoring during operations, as well as establishing a vendor checklist for their inclusion in the annual Supplier List.","procurement risk management nannalin tubpawatin cluster of logistics and rail engineering faculty of engineering, mahidol university nakhon pathom, thailand nannalin.tub@gmail.com rawinkhan srinon, ph.d. cluster of logistics and rail engineering faculty of engineering, mahidol university nakhon pathom, thailand rawinkhan.sri@mahidol.edu",
95,Analysis Of The Application Of Ergonomics To Increase  Productivity In Manufacturing Companies: A Systematic,"nowadays, manufacturing companies consider ergonomics as a relevant factor in workstations, since it is a means to ensure productivity in the company and comfort and safety of employees. however, there is still resistance to the implementation of postural assessment methods during the various production processes of different manufacturing companies. consequently, the main objective of this article is to analyze the advances in the application of ergonomics methods to improve productivity in manufacturing companies in america, europe or asia during the last 13 years. to fulfill this purpose, a systematic review of the literature was carried out, as well as a bibliometric analysis. the results will be of great value to manufacturing companies, especially those aiming to improve the efficiency of their processes, reduce musculoskeletal disorders (msds) and increase productivity. therefore, the implementation of ergonomics involves the inclusion from the corporate level to the operational level; in addition, the participation of the workers who work directly in the production processes is important, since they play an important role in guaranteeing and optimizing the smooth and safe work of the processes. this article evidences the increase of productivity in manufacturing companies through the application of ergonomics and a considerable reduction of msds along the production processes.","ergonomics, labor productivity","The present research work has focused on a field of study that has been explored and which is in constant revision since it is in a constant transition of research, innovation and implementation of technology, which allow ergonomics to adapt to the current needs and of the present study. The context of a dynamic world and prevailing in a high rate of competitiveness, demands the need to implement various methodologies and analysis of ergonomics application in manufacturing companies; such as: RULA, REBA, OWAS, symptomatological questionnaires and others; have facilitated and provided the collection of information, data and ways to implement ergonomics in production processes where a low rate of productivity is evidenced; in addition, they have served as a starting point for the exploration and implementation of new feasible solutions. However, it was evidenced the existence of limitations and disadvantages that directly and indirectly affect the traceability of the implementation of ergonomics evaluation methods, so it is important to focus future studies towards the implementation process and the significant role played by the various ergonomics evaluation methods in improving productivity at the organizational level. It is important to give an impulse to the exhaustive analysis carried out on the role of ergonomics in the large number of studies on the application of ergonomics in production processes through a systematic approach of bibliographic review. Currently, large companies are looking for the coupling of ergonomics as part of their production processes, in search of obtaining positive results in processes where low productivity due to musculoskeletal disorders has been evidenced. Finally, after performing the bibliometric analysis, it is evident that research on the various ergonomics methodologies to be used for the benefit of workers belonging to manufacturing companies, are under constant research analysis. The suggested review aims to explain the link between ergonomics and productivity and the benefits at the organizational level through the implementation of ergonomics during the production processes and with the purpose of reducing musculoskeletal disorders and increasing the productivity rate throughout the process.","review of the literature raúl alejandro ortega marchisio, faculty of engineering and architecture, university of lima, perú 20150991@aloe.ulima.edu.pe martin fidel collao-díaz research professor faculty of engineering and architecture, university of lima, perú mcollao@ulima.edu.pe",

97,Geothermal Power Generation Options And Technologies  Moses Jeremiah Barasa Kabeyi,"geothermal energy has a potential for several applications including geo-exchange, direct thermal application, and power generation. whereas the untapped capacity is over 100 gw globally, its growth realizes only 3-4% growth per year. limitations of geothermal energy includes scarcity of exploitable sites, remote locations often far from load centers and undesirable gaseous emissions. project development faces challenges of poor funding, technology, and long gestation periods of between 5 and 10 years for conventional power plants. smooth implementation of geothermal project requires, social acceptance, through minimization of environmental effect, avoidance of adverse effects on the people and giving direct benefits to local communities. it is through both subsurface and power plant technologies that environmental challenges of geothermal power plants are addressed. research and development into new, efficient and cost-effective technologies will enhance safety and environmental integrity with respect to geothermal energy and electricity development. a geothermal power plant project generally goes through exploration or prefeasibility stage, drilling or feasibility stage and development stage which involves development of production wells, reinjection wells, steam gathering system and power plant construction and commissioning. the last phase is power plant operation and maintenance before the plant is finally retired upon end of the generation contract or license. these phases of the cycle before generation combined take relatively long and there is need to improve. the use of wellhead power plants currently provides a quick access to geothermal electricity ahead of full development of a conventional power plant hence enabling quicker access to geothermal electricity. better technology in upfront activities will significantly reduce the high risks and costs while power plant conversion technologies and better reservoir management and engineering will increase output, resource availability and efficiency of resource exploitation.","geothermal, technologies, geothermal",,"industrial engineering department, durban university of technology, durban south africa moseskabeyi@yahoo.com oludolapo akanni. olanrewaju industrial engineering department, durban university of technology, durban south africa oludolapoo@dut.ac.za",

99,Solar Energy As A Sustainable Energy For Power Generation   Moses Jeremiah Barasa Kabeyi,"solar energy has been the most renewable type of energy-producing electrical power from 2013 to date. solar pv and concentrating solar-thermal power (cstp) are the two primary forms of solar energy technology . the generation of electricity from both types of solar energy has witnessed a significant increase compared to any other renewable source, with new installations totaling up to an estimated 130 gw by the end of last year. solar photovoltaic (pv) systems, are effective measures to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions related to the generation of power. however, the large exploitation of solar pv modules, leads to undesirable waste accu-mulation, impacting the environment. solar pv waste management research is an emerging field which has received more attention recently, affected by the increase volume of solar pv disposal.","solar energy, sustainable energy","Globally, the electricity sector is among the major greenhouse gas (GHG) emitters, mainly because of the use of fossil fuels. A radical transformation of the sector through a steady and evolutionary process towards a high share of renewable energy sources is vital to achieving the 1.5 °C climate change target. This is more relevant for fossil fuel- dominated energy mix jurisdictions. Grid-connected utility-scale solar PV has emerged as a potential pathway to ensure deep decarbonization of electricity in many regions. Research on utility-scale solar PV projects mainly focuses either on technical or economic feasibility, and literature assessing on environmental performance is scarce. Evaluating the life cycle environmental benefits is essential to provide scientific insight to policymakers to support decisions in the wide deployment of solar to ensure the transition to a low-carbon economy. Utility-scale solar PV is still in the early stages in Canada, hence the environmental consequences need to be investigated and compared to conventional sources of electricity. This research aimed to develop a bottom-up process-based LCA to evaluate the energy and environmental performance of large-scale solar PV farms in Alberta, Canada. The study provides robust life cycle inventory data based on the most recent commercially available technologies and maps the entire value chain. Models were used to simulate a utility-scale solar power plant and determine the required equipment sizes, thereby improving the reliability of the results. The electricity generation models developed used location-specific solar insolation data and considered changes in performance from snowy conditions. The life cycle energy profile for a utility-scale solar power plant shows that most of the energy is consumed during raw material extraction, production, and assembly of solar panels, which together account for 53% of the total consumption. Energy associated with battery manufacturing also has an important contribution, around 28% of the total consumption. The two-axis sun tracking system offers the highest mean NER value (6.6), which indicates that the system is a net energy producer. Continuous improvements in efficiency and lifetime solar PV technology would further increase the NER. The life cycle GHG emissions range from 98.3 to 149.3 g CO2 eq /kWh with a mean value of 123.8 g CO2 eq /kWh. Battery manufacturing has the largest emissions contribution (54%) which results from anode and cathode production processes. The trade-off between energy efficiency and GHG reduction can also be understood through sensitivity and uncertainty analyses. The study provides key insights to policymakers to support decisions on the wide deployment of solar to ensure the transition to a low-carbon economy. 1021","industrial engineering department, durban university of technology, durban south africa moseskabeyi@yahoo.com oludolapo akanni. olanrewaju industrial engineering department, durban university of technology, durban south africa oludolapoo@dut.ac.za","References

100,Wind Energy In Sustainable Power Generation And Supply  Moses Jeremiah Barasa Kabeyi,"modern wind turbines capture the kinetic energy of moving air and convert it into shaft power to drive an electrical generator/alternator. the turbine is typically comprised of three basic parts: the rotor, the nacelle, and the tower. the rotor includes the turbine’s blades (most often 3 in horizontal wind axis turbines) and the nose cone/hub. the nacelle contains the driveshaft, transmission a, the unit’s generator/alternator, the electronic controls to convert the generators or alternator’s electrical output to quality suitable for use, and the tail vane or yaw drive that keeps the turbine oriented to the wind, either upwind or downwind depending on the turbine’s design. because wind speed generally increases and turbulence decreases with height, a tower helps the system increase its energy production and reduces turbulence- induced mechanical stresses, thus enhancing its economic benefit. the ability of a turbine to produce energy from the wind fundamentally depends on the wind resource and the swept area of the turbine. simplifying somewhat, the power output of a turbine is proportional to the cube of the wind velocity and the square of the blade length. a doubling of the wind speed thus yields an eight-fold increase in wind power while a doubling of a turbine’s blade length yields a four-fold increase in energy capture (all other things kept constant). larger turbines with longer blades not only produce more energy for a given wind resource, but they are also more capital cost-effective as well, because of inherent economies of scale as well as inefficiencies in the market for smaller turbines. the installed cost/kw for a small turbine is twice that for a mid-scale turbine and can be several times as expensive as that for a utility-scale turbine. while these factors argue for choosing the windiest sites and installing the largest turbines on the highest towers that are cost-effective for the site – an argument understood by wind farm developers – residential and commercial site hosts cannot follow this logic to its conclusion. it is a rare home or business owner that is going to move their establishment simply to take advantage of a windier site. and several practical constraints prevent home and business owners from using the giant turbines typically found in utility-scale wind farms. neighbors might object to the presence of a turbine hundreds of feet tall because of safety, noise, and visual concerns. the turbine’s capital costs are an additional consideration: even if a site host has the space for a giant turbine, the multi-million-dollar capital cost can be difficult to finance for someone not in the wind industry. as a result of these constraints, most distributed wind turbine installations are sized roughly equivalent to the site host’s electrical load and use turbines much smaller than those found in current-day wind farms. this analysis therefore assumes that residential customers will install turbines with nominal capacity ratings of 1-9 kw, while commercial customers will install turbines with nominal capacity ratings of 10-100 kw.","wind power, wind turbines","Wind energy is a form of kinetic energy generated by the flow of air caused by temperature differences in various places and hence air pressure leading to air flow. Solar radiation received and the long-wave radiation energy released by different surfaces of the earth are different which is the cause of temperature differences at different paces. Wind energy is inexhaustible energy in the form of air that flows from an area with high air pressure to one with low air pressure. Wind is considered an attractive energy resource because it is renewable, clean, socially justifiable, economically competitive and environmentally friendly (Burton et al., 2011). Therefore, the outlook is for increasing participation on wind power in the future, up to at least 18% of global power by 2050 The fluctuating nature of wind, despite the high penetration of wind energy, poses several challenges when integrating wind power into the electric grid, since high costs can be involved for construction of wind farms as well as prior and ongoing assessment studies. Contrary to conventional energy sources, wind speed varies both spatially and temporally, generating fluctuations in wind energy output. Weather variables such as wind direction, temperature, pressure, and humidity, among others, influence wind power production. Hence, to integrate wind power into the electric grid requires estimates, at least, of future wind speed values.","industrial engineering department, durban university of technology, durban south africa moseskabeyi@yahoo.com oludolapo akanni. olanrewaju industrial engineering department, durban university of technology, durban south africa oludolapoo@dut.ac.za",
101,Hydropower In The Sustainable Energy Mix   Moses Jeremiah Barasa Kabeyi,"the technical potential for hydropower worldwide is between 31 petawatt-hours a year (pwh/y) to 127 pwh/y, while the economic potential is between 9 pwh/y to 15 pwh/y, the report notes. hydropower, which is the dominant component of renewable energy, is also under the threat of climate change. climate change has a large impact on water resources and thus on hydropower. hydropower generation is closely linked to the regional hydrological conditions of a watershed and reacts sensitively to seasonal changes in water quantity. hydropower is one of the oldest sources of mechanical power and the largest source of renewable electricity generation in use. global capacity is around 1300 gw. hydropower is site-specific and so each project will be unique. hydropower plants are classified according to their size into micro, mini, small, and large hydropower. in terms of generating the capacity the large plants are the most important. these can be either dam and reservoir plants or run-of-river stations. the latter are the easiest to construct and least disruptive, but the former stores energy and is therefore much more flexible in the way it can be used. energy is taken from hydropower plants through turbines and a number of designs such as pelton, francis and propeller turbine exist to exploit different head heights of water. most hydropower developments have environmental effects which must be taken into account before constructionhydropower potential is a function of available water and suitable terrain the main advantages of hydropower are low unit cost, low emissions, ease of control and storage. the challenges of hydropower are huge land requirements for storage, soil erosion, ecosystem disturbance and seasonal variability. about 75,000 hectares of land and 14 trillion liters of water are required on average basis to produce 1 billion kwh annually hydropower plants have a reservoir developed behind a dam to supply water to the hydraulic turbine for generation of a highly flexible, dispatchable electricity supply. hydropower can be combined with wind, solar and other sources to supply reliable steady and affordable grid electricity. hydropower can also be exploited from run-of-the-river resources which have less environmental impact but with overreliance on steady supply of rainwater whose supply is unsteady and unpredictable. apart from power generation, reservoirs can control floods, supply water, and power from stored water even during drought. hydroelectric electric power plants are useful for grid electricity sustainability particularly during peak hours where plants that generate flexible and cheaper electricity are on high demand.","global warming, renewable sources, wind energy, in 2016","Hydropower is a form of energy obtained from the flowing of water. Waterpower is one of the most cost-effective ways to generate electrical energy and is often the favoured technique when available (Mekonnen and Hoekstra, 2011). For example, hydropower accounts for 99% of all the electricity generated in Norway (Bakken et al., 2012). In China, the Three Gorges Dam, with a capacity of 22.5 GW, is the world's largest hydroelectric project. It generates between 80 and 100 terawatt-hours of electricity per year, enough to power between 70 and 80 million homes (Zarfl et al., 2015; Heming et al., 2001). The use of hydropower, as an example, has significantly enhanced energy access in Cambodia, where the power generated from hydropower increased from 32 to 4370 GWh between 2010 and 2019 (Baird and Green, 2020). It is essential to mention that micro-hydropower projects on a small scale can make a tremendous difference in rural areas (Fujii et al., 2017). Even though hydropower accounted for the largest share of global renewable power capacity, with a cumulative capacity of 1211 GW in 2020, the annual increase in hydropower electricity is much less than solar and wind energy in recent years. Overall, the installed capacity of hydropower energy worldwide.","industrial engineering department, durban university of technology, durban south africa moseskabeyi@yahoo.com oludolapo akanni. olanrewaju industrial engineering department, durban university of technology, durban south africa oludolapoo@dut.ac.za",
102,Optimal Driving Strategy At Signalized Intersections For  Improving Traffic Flow And Congestion Mitigation,"in recent years, the continuing development of automobiles and road transportation systems have changed to more sophisticated ones incorporating inter-vehicular communication and automated driving technology. however, many problems still need to be solved in the road traffic system. one of them is the deterioration of traffic flow at signalized intersections. deterioration of traffic flow at signalized intersections affects the smoothness of traffic and the fuel consumed by vehicles. one of the leading causes of poor traffic flow is that intersections confine the traffic volumes. the need for appropriate signal cycles and traffic demand also leads to traffic congestion. over the last few decades, there has been much research on improving traffic flow at signalized intersections to achieve smooth traffic flow. among them, the idea of adjusting the signal cycle according to the traffic volume of each intersecting road is a major one. additionally, the traditional approach in signalized intersections is adjusting the signal cycle according to the time of day in actual road traffic. however, changing the signal cycle to a suitable depending on the current traffic load is not expected to improve the traffic capacity in the intersections. observation reveals that shorter signal cycles result in a better flow of under-saturated traffic. however, more frequent signal switching increases the intersection loss time, reducing the effective green time needed by traffic, i.e., reducing traffic capacity and worsening traffic flow. to solve these problems, a control method that reduces the time wasted during signal switching is considered effective. therefore, this paper proposes an optimal control method in which an automatic vehicle decides on appropriate pre- start before a signal changeover at a signal intersection from a far distance that is determined optimally. in this model, by receiving the signal cycle information, the first vehicle starts a few seconds before the signal changeover, arriving at the intersection at the green time with a higher speed. thus, drivers can cross the intersection at an increased rate and faster than conventional human traffic. in this study, the automated vehicle is controlled using model predictive control (mpc). the model was evaluated by simulating ten vehicles and one signal intersection. the described model, where only the lead vehicle used automatic driving control and the trailing vehicles used a conventional motion model, was compared to the traditional motion model with all ten vehicles using a human following motion model. the results demonstrate that the proposed model improves the crossing time for the ten vehicles by 9.5% compared to existing traffic, which is expected to increase the road traffic similarly to mitigate congestion.","automated driving, optimization",,"kenta nakakura, magzhan atykhan, md abdus samad kamal and kou yamada graduate school of science and technology gunma university, gunma, japan t231b063@gunma-u.ac.jp, magzhan.atykhan@gmail.com, maskamal@gunma-u.ac.jp",
103,Optimizing Computed Tomography (Ct) Systems For  Enhanced Security Screening Applications In,"the safety and security of tourists, goods, and infrastructure are greatly influenced by customs and airport security procedures. to find and identify forbidden objects including explosives, firearms, drugs, and other contraband materials, a variety of scanner types are used. the security inspection technologies utilized at airports and customs facilities across the world now include x-ray, computed tomography (ct), and trace detection systems. the research also examines rapiscan systems, smiths detection, and nuctech as the top three rivals in the security inspection market. each organization has its own strengths and problems when offering efficient security solutions for diverse industries. while these scanners' detection capabilities have substantially increased, there is still a key gap in the integration of several technologies for a more complete and efficient screening procedure. closing this gap will improve the overall efficacy of security measures and help to the future creation of a more robust and seamless security inspection system. customs inspection is an important process that involves verifying the contents of goods, ensuring compliance with regulations, and detecting any attempts to smuggle contraband or illegal goods. the inspection process typically involves examining documentation such as bills of lading, invoices, and packing lists, as well as physically inspecting the goods themselves. customs officials may use a variety of techniques and tools, including x- ray machines, sniffer dogs, and physical inspections, to ensure that the goods being imported or exported are legal, safe, and comply with all relevant regulations. the goal of customs inspection is to prevent illegal activity, protect public health and safety, and promote fair trade practices. effective customs inspection can help to facilitate international trade and ensure that goods move efficiently across borders while maintaining high standards of safety and security. the purpose of this project is to develop a new inspection for dubai customs by developing a 3d scanner that shows shipments without any manual intervention. 1. introduction because of its increased capabilities in detecting and identifying forbidden objects, computed tomography (ct) has become a crucial tool in the field of security inspection, particularly in airports and customs facilities. despite its numerous advantages, the introduction and operation of ct scanners in these situations is fraught with difficulties and restrictions. the study's goal will be to increase the efficiency, accuracy, and cost-effectiveness of ct scanners in security inspections while overcoming present restrictions such as restricted space, high energy consumption, and regulatory compliance. there is an urgent need to investigate novel tactics and strategies for improving the performance of ct scanners in security applications. this involves looking into ways to reduce false alarms, improve detection of a wider spectrum of threats, and lessen the impact on passenger flow and cargo processing delays. additionally, to establish a more thorough and smooth security screening process, ct technology should be integrated with other security inspection systems like x-ray and trace detection. resolving these issues will help to 1069",,"The literature analysis emphasizes the continuous development of customs check technology at airports, with a focus on balancing security, efficiency, and privacy. It profiles three key security inspection solution providers: Rapiscan Systems, Smiths Detection, and NUCTECH. The study also emphasizes the importance of improving Computed Tomography (CT) technology for customs inspections. The suggested Multi-Slice CT scanner with integrated AI capabilities is proposed as a solution to enhance security screening. This technology has the potential to improve security, reduce false alarms, and provide a smoother travel experience for passengers, with applications in transportation hubs and high-security zones.","transportation hubs and high-security areas nader santarisi associate professor engineering technology & science higher colleges of technology, dubai women's campus dubai, uae nsantarisi@hct.ac.ae fatma khamis and fatma rashed senior students, school of industrial engineering higher colleges of technology (hct) dubai, uae h00421972@hct.ac.ae, h00421973@hct.ac.ae",
104,Reliability Demonstration Tests – Challenges And  Opportunities In The Automotive Industry,"in the automotive industry, the reliability of products is often defined by a so-called b10-value. that means, that at a defined point in time, the maximal failure probability is 10 %. due to the fact that the b10-value correlates to the required service, it is quite challenging to proof a service life expectation, for example 250.000 km for a passenger car, in a quite short time frame for testing activities within a product development project. if the test duration corresponds to the service life requirement, then 22 test specimens must pass the test procedure without failure in order to confirm the required minimum reliability. however, if the test has to be carried out in a shorter time, more test specimens must be tested without failure. assumptions regarding the failure characteristics are then required to determine the number of test specimens. in some applications, the sample size can easily reach three-digit values and therefore often reaches the limits of feasibility. during the development of products, the proof of product reliability is therefore a challenging activity. in addition to a procedural flow of test planning, correlations between reliability requirements and various test parameters such as test duration and sample size are shown. the test quality is evaluated by the confidence level, whose dependencies are also determined. especially uncertainties and their consequences are part of this study. one example is the estimation of the shape parameter of a weibull distributed failure characteristic in the planning phase. possible sources for the estimation and the consequences of uncertainties of the estimation are analyzed. after performing a reliability demonstration test, the impact of uncertainties on the results are under consideration. the effects of uncertainties of the planning phase, e.g. uncertainties of the estimation of the weibull shape parameter, to the demonstrated reliability and the confidence level are shown. finally, case studies give an impression of the importance of the uncertainties.","reliability proof, sample size, confidence level, test duration",,"tobias leopold professor faculty mobility and technology esslingen university of applied sciences, germany tobias.leopold@hs-esslingen.de",

106,A Process Innovation In The Way Of Learning   Banu (Sarıkaya) Özkeser,"new graduates in automotive engineering are expected having both technical skills and developed personal qualifications like creativity and teamwork. owing to these requirements, the engineering education system should consist of a curriculum depending on the industrial revolution 4.0. project based learning approach, a kind of process innovation, can be taken into account as a key to ensure this expectation. it is also an exit point to get the success in the pandemic period because project based learning can give the advantage to the students to study in online meetings. it’s not obligatory to have face-to-face communication. this study aims to show the project based learning opportunities in automotive engineering department in çukurova university, turkey. the students taking this course have the chance to develop themselves by working in group projects and this innovation course is based on the real problems round the world. therefore, being a member of these groups lead the students to research, share their opinions and respect the others’, prepare the report as it’s required. in other words, it is possible to find a solution in a professional way and this helps the students add a different qualification in their resumes. it’s no doubt that the university and industry collaboration needs this kind of students, having an experience in the real-life projects. the perceptions of the class in this course were further investigated through a questionnaire and the conclusion shows all the class is satisfied with this implementation. furthermore, the performance of the students is appreciated and finally, project based learning is strongly recommended especially in pandemic terms in case of relevant.",process innovation,"This study was conducted with the aim of evaluating the effects of using Project Based approach in “Innovation and Cooperate Entrepreneurship” course to young automotive engineer candidates compared to using traditional methods and techniques. It is also aimed to investigate the expectations of students on PBL teaching. The findings of the implementation elicit that teaching innovation through PBL ensure more successful scores than teaching by the use of more traditional methods and techniques. PBL is an outstanding approach as it is applicable to all grades of learners and almost in all areas of education. It provides an active process for students enabling them to cooperate with each other and motivating them through the activities and with a product that is presented by students to real audiences. In other words, PBL can be taken into consideration as a process innovation that leads peer- learning, too. Especially, in pandemic terms PBL is a practical and future-oriented way of students’ evaluation. It is also thought as a future based method Furthermore, PBL may be recommended for use in other courses depending on implementation. In essence, PBL supports peer-learning by means of group working and learning principles. Before the process, a brief knowledge about projects may be given, thus this may help the students manage the time. Also group work in crowded classrooms can be a little bit hard and may create class management problem which can be a negative situation for timing. In that situation, number of group members may be limited by the academician. The full implementation of PBL in the curriculum is not easy to do, so the first experience can be a partial implementation, too.

Seven dimensions of the quality of cat care services have been successfully developed through analysis of literature reviews and Focus Group Discussions (FGD) involving consumers and veterinarians as the voice of customers, namely Tangibles, Reliability, Responsiveness, Assurance, Empathy, Veterinary Ethics, and Pet Safety; along with 31 attributes that reflect the expectations and needs of customers. The results of the literature study show various characteristics that apply to the Tangibles and Assurance dimensions, while the Responsiveness, Empathy, and Veterinary Ethic aspects were identified through FGDs with input from the literature study. The Pet Safety dimension appears as a new dimension due to FGP, which prioritizes animal safety and health factors during maintenance. It is very important to include the consumer as the voice of the customer in the FGD when conducting this study so that the dimensions and quality created represent the actual expectations and demands. The SERVQUAL method also allows a systematic way to measure service quality.

108,Monte Carlo Simulation Of Project Completion Times: A  Case Study For An Electric Vehicle Project,"making strong predictions about the project completion time under uncertainty is crucial for project management. therefore, when a project task duration is not exactly known, a probability distribution can be fitted to the duration to model randomness. however, choosing the wrong distribution can lead to serious errors. triangular and beta distributions are generally preferred as task time probability distribution, but it can be very difficult for an expert to estimate the maximum value for triangular distribution and the mean and mode for beta distribution. due to such shortcomings, instead of beta and triangular distributions, using lognormal and weibull distributions which have long right tails may provide more accurate results when distributions that can take large values albeit with small probabilities are appropriate for a task time. in this study, data including task dependencies and task time estimates like minimum, most likely, and (probabilistic) maximum time is collected for 120 tasks of an electric vehicle production project. then, triangular, lognormal, and weibull probability distributions are fitted to all task times, respectively, and monte carlo simulations are performed to produce project completion times. finally, the probability distribution function of project completion time is obtained for each of the three distributional settings. the 0.9, 0.95, and 0.99 quantiles are used to analyze project completion time distributions and it is revealed that lognormally distributed task times yield significantly larger quantiles than others, also weibull distribution causes greater quantiles compared to triangular distribution. it shows how unconscious selection of probability distribution can have misleading results.",project management,,"ümmügülüsüm erdağı and kemal dinçer dingeç department of industrial engineering gebze technical university kocaeli, turkey uerdagi@gtu.edu.tr, kdingec@gtu.edu.tr engin sansarcı department of industrial engineering altınbaş university i̇stanbul, turkey engin.sansarci@altinbas.edu.tr",
109,Configurations Of Requirements Instability In Enterprise  Asset Development Projects,"project failures resulting from requirements instability in enterprise asset development projects can detrimentally affect the strategic goals of sponsoring organisations. previous research in project management has primarily concentrated on evolving business needs, technological changes, and socio-political complexity as drivers of requirements instability. however, emerging evidence suggests that the decision-making of project owners is also shaped by their emotional responses to various contextual conditions, such as the physicality of the asset, project scale and duration, asset lifespan, and perceived environmental uncertainty. in this paper, we draw on the psychological ownership theory to investigate how different configurations of contextual conditions contribute to requirements instability in enterprise asset development projects. our empirical findings, delivered from a global survey of 274 project management professionals, further elucidate the influence of project owners' emotions and perceptions on requirements change management decisions. using fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis, we identify five distinct project configurations of contextual conditions that lead to high levels of requirements instability in enterprise asset development projects. we contribute to behavioural project management literature by offering a configurational perspective on how varying contextual conditions across projects impact project owners’ decision-making behaviours and choices.",asset physicality,,"shobhit mathur iitb-monash research academy indian institute of technology bombay and monash university caulfield east, vic 3145, australia shobhit.mathur@monash.edu tarikere t. niranjan shailesh j. mehta school of management indian institute of technology bombay mumbai 400076, india ttniranjan@iitb.ac.in kristian rotaru monash business school monash university caulfield east, vic 3145, australia kristian.rotaru@monash.edu",

It is for this reason that the Layout design and the effort matrix were applied, which allowed us to identify which of The proposals generate less effort to be the one chosen. According to Súle (2001), efficient distribution can also contribute to the reduction in production cycles, material handling, etc. For the correct distribution, loads and the distance to the travel point were taken, to later make calculations of the effort and the number of pallets that are removed during the process. It is in this sense that the proposed distribution presents less effort than the current one. Furthermore, as Batista Martins & Tavares de Freitas (2011) mention, good distribution helps with flexibility and reduction of time by up to 20%. In the same way, the new proposed distribution presents a travel time of 15 minutes compared to 45 minutes in the current version, the result being 66% less than in the original plan. Furthermore, according to Mejia et al. (2011) the correct tracking of materials through a control system improves the lifetime of indirect materials by not rotating outside their established flow. The average lifetime of the pallets in the current distribution is 1 year; however, in the proposed design it is 2.5 years. Finally, the research allowed us to determine what would be the ideal flow through which the pallets should be managed, and this also allowed savings of 32% of the total annual supply costs of indirect materials. Finally, this could be achieved with the WMS tool connected to the company's ERP.","leonardo sebastian carranza-quijaite and silvana paola chirinos-ayala facultad de ingeniería, carrera de ingeniería industrial, universidad de lima, perú 20180353@aloe.ulima.edu.pe, 20180446@aloe.ulima.edu.pe juan carlos quiroz-flores research professor facultad de ingeniería, carrera de ingeniería industrial, universidad de lima, perú jcquiroz@ulima.edu.pe",

The lack of private non DNSP firms funding smaller batteries is clear that revenues are not tied to the operational issues of time shifting peak solar and increasing host capacity.
