0,Improving Forecasting Accuracy To Reduce Variability Of  Customer Service Level,"this work describes the efforts of the leading mexican convenience store company to look for opportunities to reduce a high level of customer service variability at the store echelon. the company was having high customer service variability originating that 42% of the time, on average, stores were out of stock. after an analysis of the structure of the distribution network and the actual forecasting and inventory management schemes, the authors found that the main cause behind the deficient performance was poor demand forecasting accuracy and incomplete inventory management scheme structures. therefore, the improvement initiatives designed were developed to select correct or adequate forecasting procedures for the different demand patterns and the modification of the structure of the inventory schemes. initial results are obtained from a pilot study carried out in all sku´s of all the stores of the puerto vallarta plaza of the company. the resulting forecasting mean squared error (mse) was decreased significantly in the order of 43%. the firm estimates a reduction of about 21% of the level of inventories and of 22 percentual points of customer service variability at the retailing stores due to the improvement in forecasting accuracy",retail echelon,"The level of competitiveness of the retailing sector is dependent on the level of product availability at the store. Under these circumstances, the effectiveness of the forecasting and inventory management schemes becomes important. The case of study treated in this paper deals with the improvement of the level of precision of demand forecasting at the store level. The company was dealing with the problem of having excessive level of customer service variability in its stores. An exhaustive analysis of the contribution to this excess was developed and found that forecasting performance for inventory management purposes could be improved. Thus, an initiative based on the application of the ADIDA (Nikolopoulos et al. 2011) methodology and a change of forecasting procedure could be implemented for these purposes. Additionally, it was also identified the need to modify the periodic inventory management scheme to include safety stock for B and C-F items. As described in section 4, the impact of implementing the previously mentioned efforts was very positive. Simulation studies and pilot program actions estimate a total reduction of customer service variability of the order of 79%. Based on the previous positive results, the company decided to make a full implementation of the initiatives in Puerto Vallarta. The following step agreed by the operations management consisted of deploying a similar analysis and design scheme for the rest of the plazas in Mexico. The application described in this work provides additional evidence of the benefits of implementing ADIDA to improve forecasting accuracy for intermittent demand items.","mónica balderas, andrea araiza, mariana peña & bernardo villarreal universidad de monterrey san pedro garza garcía, n.l., méxico 66238 monica.balderas@udem.edu, andrea.araiza@udem.edu, mariana.penar@udem.edu, bernardo.villarreal@udem.edu",
1,Resource Recovery From Paper Mill Sludge Through  Vermicomposting,"huge amounts of paper mill sludge are generated from the paper manufacturing industries and these can pose environmental contamination problems if not properly managed. vermicomposting was therefore investigated as a paper mill waste management initiative to produce vermicompost. a total of 3kg of paper mill sludge was fed into a vermireactor and allowed to vermicompost over a period of 60 days using eisenia fetida as the vermicomposting media. the paper mill sludge had a moisture content of 65% and the vermicomposting processed occurred under standard conditions aerobically. after the 60 days, the vermicompost was analysed for the total nitrogen (tkn), phosphorous (tp) and potassium (tk) composition using standard methods. the vermicompost had an average of 4.3%, 0.45% and 1.89% for tkn, tp and tk respectively. vermiwash was also generated during the process and contained 1.63%, 0.14% and 0.59% respectively for tkn, tp and tk. the paper mill vermicompost can be used as a source of bio fertilizers.","earthworms, paper mill sludge, resource recovery, tk, tkn","Paper mill sludge can be valorised to vermicompost through the application of the vermicompost technology. Vermicompost with TKN, TP and TK with composition of 4.30%, 0.45% and 1.89% respectively were produced. Significant increases in these parameters was noted and ascertained by the 39% decrease in organic loading. Vermiwash with TKN, TP and TK compositions of 1.63%, 0.14% and 0.59% respectively was also produced.","m. m. manyuchi department of operations and quality management, faculty of engineering and the built environment, university of johannesburg, south africa mercy.manyuchi@gmail.com c. mbohwa department of operations and quality management, faculty of engineering and the built environment, university of johannesburg, south africa cmbohwa@uj.ac.za e. muzenda department of chemical engineering technology, faculty of engineering and the built environment, university of johannesburg, south africa department of chemical, materials and metallurgical engineering, faculty of engineering and technology, botswana international university of science and technology, p bag 16, palapye, botswana muzendae@biust.ac.bw w. stinner german biomass research institute, leipzig, germany walter.stinner@dbfz.de",
2,Increase Plant Productivity Using An Oee Approach: An  Application,"european refrigerated food companies must be highly efficient under a very competitive environment. that is the case for one of the leading conglomerates based on spain. after an unfortunate event where the group´s largest frank production plant was unable to continue working, the company adopted a sense of urgency to achieve customer demand increasing the efficiency of the rest of its production network by 25-30%. the current study has the purpose of describing the experience of applying the concept of operational equipment effectiveness in a spanish frankfurter plant. this approach is imbedded into a theory of constraints scheme that insures a positive contribution to the objective of increasing productivity with each initiative implemented. a description of the results achieved is provided.","productivity, efficiency, availability, performance","With the 15 hours week gained after the implementation of the previous described scheme, the plant was able to produce 17.5 tons per week. Lines efficiency went up by 11%, this had not been reached since the production had risen in a 28%. Sharing best practices lead to the implementation of better maintenance routines that provided better equipment efficiency and resulted in a better working environment. The combination of important tools such as OEE and TOC, resulted in important factory level discoveries, its easy replication allowed the factory to continue a horizontal deployment to the rest of 9 franks production lines. A highly efficient integrated system is possible; with the help of a combination of TPM tools, results were exceeded. As mentioned in the introduction, the gains made in OEE at the equipment level, are not enough, Scott et al., (1998). TPM, TOC, OEE plus operators’ knowledge where the key ingredients for success, considering best practices shared by operators in plant around the world gave this project the extra needed to perceive results. Some further recommendations would include considering TPM by itself is already a powerful set of tools that are proven to work, but an operator’s knowledge should never be less important than any tool. Consider the amount of time a day some operators share with a production line, they know and understand, any little noise or vibration made by a machine. Sometimes, given competition and time pressure, people forget the most important resource in a plant is human resource. Once again literature is proven right, the results of TPM and its combination with almost any other engineering tool are real. Having the opportunity to read, understand and apply what learned in real life was such a delight, what is next is to share this practice to other plants for them to learn from what done with these franks production lines and start working for results.","mariana molina-barrientos, teresa verduzco & bernardo villarreal departamento de ingeniería universidad de monterrey san pedro garza garcía, nuevo león, méxico 66238 mariana.molina@udem.edu, teresa.verduzco@udem.edu, bernardo.villarreal@udem.edu",

10,Design Of An Automated Vegetable Cutter And Slicer  Guide S Ganyani,"manual cutting and slicing of vegetables has proved to be very time consuming and is prone to the risk of contamination of the food leading to high rates of foodborne diseases. various methods have been implemented in the process of size reduction of vegetables ranging from manual, electric and automated. the desire to make a design that simplifies, that saves time, that is relatively cheaper and efficienct during the process of size reduction of vegetables was the main scope of the whole project. the contaminant free products will be produced through the use of u.v light and this machine will incorporate u.v light as its integral component. the principle of operation of the machine is attached to the theory of rotating hollow discs. experiments were conducted at the department laboratory and a force of 19.5n was obtained for the hardest vegetable. the machines available in zimbabwe have posed to be very expensive while they are only availed abroad. the machine must always be used with caution since it has rotating elements. in conclusion, the objectives were met and the most importantly the cost was in the desired range hence acceptable to the market. from the cost analysis, the total price required for the vegetable cutter and slicer is $890.73.","uv-light, zimbabwe","Designing of the automated vegetable cutter and slicer was successfully implemented within the required budget of USD1000, the machine can do several cuts and slice sizes depending on the consumer requirement (macedoine, julienne, etc). Moreover, the Implemented U.V platform ensures safe products for immediate consumption without any harm both to the user and the food. Use was made of locally available materials to construct the design to success thus a great margin was achieved in terms of costs.

12,Caldwell-T Algorithm Validation:  Alternative Proposal To The Solution Of Gupta For The,"gupta algorithm was proposed back in 1972 to reduce cycle times, with very good performance results and it has been successfully used as a sequencing solution in critical activities in lean software develop processes. an alternative to this algorithm is presented with validation evidence on this document, using heuristic rules when equal selecting factors occurs. the algorithm, named caldwell-t, can be used to solve, effectively, the possible clashes of activity that can occur in shared resources, as opposed to the traditional methodology, which encourages multitasking. caldwell-t algorithm obtained 78% performance effectiveness over gupta proposal using a simulation model with industry data. this improvement gives a big impact in software develop projects, when it is applied to critical chains and feeding buffers and signal calculations. however, the new algorithm may yield less effective results compared with gupta algorithm for certain random configurations of expected times of execution of activities, in approximately 20% of the cases, which allows to deduce that it is better to analyze the configuration of the multiproject environment with both algorithms, instead of putting them to compete. the results of this research is highly valuable because gupta algorithm is powerful compare with ga solutions and other ia approaches.","heuristic algorithm, sequencing, six sigma","And Future Research Work The Caldwell-t algorithm shows to be robust compared with Gupta's algorithm, to reduce cycle times in slender software development environments, significantly reducing waste by sequencing shared resources in multiproject and multitasking environments. Clearly, the new algorithm could become a tool for optimizing the execution of multiple projects to execute faster the routines of small cycles of programming of use cases. It can also be used to solve, effectively, the possible clashes of activity that can occur in shared resources, as opposed to the traditional methodology, which encourages multitasking. However, the new algorithm may yield less effective results compared with Gupta for certain random configurations of expected times of execution of activities, in approximately 20% of the cases, which allows to deduce that it is better to analyze the configuration of the multiproject environment with both algorithms, instead of putting them to compete. This is important taking into account that both algorithms have the same degree of simplicity in their calculation and application by automatic means. With this research it is demonstrated that the development of tiebreaker rules and algorithms could generate benefits in reducing the development times of computer projects and could facilitate the adoption of lean practices. As a future line of research, the exploration of these algorithms for different configurations of development projects with multi-routes and specific variabilities at the time of conclusion of activities is proposed.","sequencing of activities in processes of slender development of software with critical chain approach eldon caldwell smart, lean and cognitive systems laboratory industrial engineering department university of costa rica san josé, costa rica eldon.caldwell@ucr.ac.cr",
13,On Board Unit For Electronic Toll Collection Service  In Supporting Make Indonesia 4.0,"indonesian toll management bureau envisages implementation of the on board unit (obu) usage as part of its integrated payment system in lieu of cash and e-card system. observations and surveys were conducted vis-a-vis 48,013 toll-road users to determine the suitable obu types and its potential contributions toward efficient tollgate queuing time. subsequently, it is expected to concurrently determine the appropriate promotion tools that support toll-road users particularly in non-tapping payment system of obu. house of quality and v/c ratio are the basis of the problem formulation in this research. the study shows that a flexible mount obu device which displays its current available balance are desired by most toll-road users. moreover, toll-road users expect the single piece microwave obu device to be waterproof, heatproof, and durable. comparing to e-card system, its usage reduces the queuing time by 50% to 60%. additionally, the study shows that collaboration with gas station is the most appropriate promotion model. these research findings provide beneficial feedback for both toll-road authorities and related business stakeholders.","house of quality, v/c ratio","and Discussion The results of this study recommend the use of OBU devices that can be accepted by most people in Indonesia, through the design of OBU devices that are fit for the needs of toll road users, promotion models that are suitable for users from the Greater Jakarta area (Jakarta-Bogor-Depok-Tangerang-Bekasi) in order to increase the use of the OBU device, and decrease the queue or the efficiency of the transaction time at the toll gates. More than 80% of respondents supported the government's plan to implement the use of OBU devices as ETCs throughout Indonesia, noting that OBU devices that were circulated had affordable prices, were easy to obtain, and provided an adequate toll booth for toll road transactions using the OBU device. The use of OBU is still rare nowadays, especially because respondents are less aware of where OBU devices can be purchased; even among them there are many who are not aware of the presence of OBU device technology for ETC; prices that are still expensive, and many respondents who are not bank customers of OBU device providers. The lack of a toll booth that provides ETC with OBU devices, is also a complaint from OBU users that needs attention to be addressed, including the OBU sensor which is felt to be insensitive, and lack of collaboration with various other banks. The results of this study recommend an OBU device that is integrated with a smart card (single piece microwave), with a size that fits in the hand, easy installation and placement in the vehicle, and has an LED screen (to show OBU status and balance checking), and features communication to support the ease of use of functions on the OBU device. Furthermore, the results of this study also recommend OBU devices with components that are waterproof, impact and hot weather resistant. In addition to providing recommendations for OBU device designs that are fit for users, this study also aims to obtain forms of cooperation that are interesting to toll road users to encourage the purchase of OBU devices, so that the government's goal to carry out non-cash payments throughout Indonesia can be accommodated. The form of collaboration between toll road managers and SPBU companies, which can provide relief for the purchase of OBU devices, is highly recommended by the results of this study. With the increase in the use of OBU devices as electronic toll collection, not only are touchless toll transaction plans accommodated, but also a significant decrease in the queue (50% -60%) can also be more evenly distributed throughout the country. Corrected queue levels can significantly support environmental reservations and various other forms of reservation, including health. The duration of transactions using the OBU device as an ETC in a matter of 1.46 seconds, is also able to meet the government's target of setting a standard transaction for one vehicle for 2.3 seconds. Finally, the results of this study certainly still require generalization and follow-up to further research, for example by using other calculation models that can better accommodate the complexity of the actual conditions, and other sampling techniques. In line with the National Non-Cash Movement (Hutauruk, 2017), in the future, more research is expected to be able to explore forms of payment transactions that support the implementation of Multi Lane Free Flow on toll roads throughout Indonesia, which is suitable for most users in Indonesia, and various forms of cooperation and promotions to be able to continue to increase its use. 76","hwi-chie ho, laili latifa, claudia clarice, arvin raditya industrial engineering department bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia hhchie@binus.edu","References

14,Cyber-Security Policy Framework And Procedural  Compliance In Public Organisations,"this study was motivated by the fact that many organisations in tanzania and africa in general fails to meet security requirements suggested through iso 27001 security standards, due to the lack of a credible cyber-security policy. the purpose was to develop the policy framework suitable in the management of the cyber-security in organisation level. also, the study determined the compliance of selected cases for study to procedures for cyber policy formulation and review. the study used the qualitative approach. it engaged the literature in the conceptualisation of the study, used the discussion between researchers to formulate themes of the new cyber-security policy, used the focus group to improve the cyber-security policy framework, and used a survey questionnaire to study procedures and the formalisation of the cyber-security policy. fifteen (15) organisation were represented in the survey, while ten (10) participants from six (6) organisations and four (4) countries were engaged in a focus group discussion. both purposive and convenient methods were used in sampling. this study formulated a framework for cyber-security policy with seven themes: data security, internet and network services governance, uses of company owned devices, physical security, incident handling and reporting, monitoring and compliance, and policy administrative issues. moreover, the study confirmed that few organisations engages stakeholders in policy formulation and conduct the policy review at the interval not exceeding three years. moreover, many organisations uses cyber-security policies without the authorisation of the top authority of their organisation. the study recommends the formulation of a comprehensive cyber-security policy through the use of the lubua’s cyber-security policy. further to this, the policy formulation procedure must be inclusive, and guided by existing organisation guidelines. the maximum of three (3) years is recommended for policy review. the formalisation of the policy document must be approved by the top authority of the organisation. key words: cyber-security policy, policy framework, cyber policy framework, tanzania, developing countries 1. introduction the number of crimes conducted through cyber platforms is growing fast across the globe. globally, cybercrimes are projected to cost economic investments about six (6) trillion us$ annually, by 2021. this projection suggests the increase in cyber incidents to individual users and organisations (saunders, 2017; herjavec group, 2017). unfortunately, nearly half of all attacks are committed to small businesses (herjavec group, 2017). the situation is more alarming because of undocumented incidents, hence, the situation is likely to be worse. it is unarguable that the prevalence of cyber offenses is not suitable for social, political and the economic activities, because users become preys to criminals (international telecommunication union, 2009). cybercrimes may lead to the defamation of the reputation of an individual, and/or loss of money (lewis, 2018). further to this, cybercriminals 1847",,"and Recommendation This study addressed three key aspects of the cyber-security policy. First, the study developed the framework suitable for policy formulation. The study concludes by suggesting a cyber policy framework with seven key themes: Data security, Internet and network services governance, uses of company owned devices, physical security, incident handling and reporting, monitoring and compliance, and policy administrative issues. This study recommends the use of this framework in ensuring that the cyber-security policy is comprehensive. Moreover, study observed that the suggested case for study did not meet the framework’s expectations. This observation is equally supported by representatives of other organisations. Factors contributing to the lack of comprehensive policy, as per this study, includes the lack of knowledge on policy formulation procedures, failure to involve key stakeholders, the lack of formalised guidelines, and the lack of policy review. It is the recommendation of this study that all of these activities must be guided by the cyber-security policy or other guidelines of the organisation. 7.","dr. edison wazoel lubua department of informatics institute of accountancy arusha, tanzania elubua@iaa.ac.tz prof. philip d pretorius school of computing and information systems north-west university, vaal campus, south africa philip.pretorius@nwu.ac.za",

16,Supplier Evaluation And Segmentation In Cheese Company  Using Best-Worst Method And Topsis,"suppliers have an important role in the supply chain. the problem occurred in supplier, such as delay, quality and quantity inaccuracy in the delivery of raw materials, can cause losses to the company. it is complicated for a company to manage all suppliers individually, especially when the company has many suppliers. supplier evaluation has become critical for company to determine the suitable action plan in managing each supplier. one effective way to manage different suppliers systematically is supplier segmentation. this study aims to integrate supplier evaluation and segmentation based on capabilities and willingness dimensions. the methods used in this study are best-worst method (bwm) aimed to obtain the weight of supplier evaluation criteria, and technique for order of preference by ideal solution (topsis) method to obtain the final score of each supplier which will be the basis for segmenting suppliers. the case study is applied to cheese company in indonesia. the results of this study are segmenting 22 suppliers of cheese's raw materials into four different quadrants, and recommending suitable action plans to manage each supplier quadrant.","cheese company, best-worst method","This study on supplier evaluation and segmentation obtained 8 criteria (with 24 sub-criteria) for capabilities dimension and 4 criteria (with 13 sub-criteria) for willingness dimension in evaluating suppliers. Based on calculations with BWM, supplier evaluation sub-criteria with the highest weight on the capabilities dimension is Quality, while the criteria that have the highest weight for willingness dimension is Commitment to improve continuously in products and processes. The results of supplier segmentation for one of the cheese company in Indonesia shows that 3 suppliers are in quadrant 1, 3 suppliers are in quadrant 2 , 3 suppliers are in quadrant 3, and 13 suppliers are in quadrant 4. To manage suppliers based on the result of segmentation, the company is advised to replace suppliers in quadrant 1, provide quality improvement education and target setting for suppliers in quadrant 2, make long-term commitments and improve communications for suppliers in quadrant 3, and maintain relationships for suppliers in quadrant 4. This approach of BWM-TOPSIS for supplier evaluation and segmentation in cheese company is practical and can be implemented for company in other industry to manage different suppliers effectively and systematically by evaluate and segment its suppliers. The limitation of this study is the number of supplier quadrant, which can be increased by including another dimension for segmenting the suppliers. Another limitation relates to adapting the center point of scales (0.5) as the transition point of the low and high classification. In future research, the transition point can be adjusted based on the requirement of the buying company. Another recommendation for future research is by adapting other MCDM methods and comparing the result with BWM-TOPSIS segmentation result, to eventually identify the suitability of each method for different situation. Lastly, the number of experts involved can be increased to better validate the study.","m. dachyar and aulia karima maharani department of industrial engineering universitas indonesia depok 16424, indonesia mdachyar@yahoo.com, auliakarimam@yahoo.co.id",

The complexity of production process design (TR 3.2); separation of high-risk materials during storage and handling (TR 2.4); and conducting the production process according to the procedure or written instruction (TR 7.3) are 3 TR with the highest relative importance. The filling and sterilization process have the highest potential of causing defects with an RPN above 100. Dented (body) has an RPN of 240, channeling has an RPN of 140, the dented body has an RPN of 128, and dented (skewed) has an RPN of 120. Failure in form of a flat bottle gets the highest severity (9), but the ranking for the occurrence frequency and the current detection control is so low that the resulting RPN is small. Based on the results of the above analysis, managerial advice and recommendations that goes accordingly with the current condition of the company and can be applied to reduce defects are by replacing the layer with the new one and analyzing the layer material currently used to see whether it is suitable for the existing requirements. Therefore, to suppress the number of dents, benchmarking can be done to other branch factories regarding the temperature used for the sterilization process in order to reduce the risk of overheating, resulting the bottle to deform from its initial form. In addition to improve the tools and methods used, it is also important to provide problem solving training for workers/operators to enhance their skill in taking action as well as increase their contribution in every job (production process) that is carried out, such as when there is temperature or pressure instability, workers/operators in the field must be able to take an action so that the damage is not too severe.","m dachyar and galuh paramitha rachmadhani department of industrial engineering universitas indonesia depok, jawa barat 16424, indonesia mdachyar@yahoo.com, galuhprr@yahoo.com",

21,Development Of An Evaporative  Cooler For Small Scale Agro Producers,"the study seeks to develop an evaporative cooler that can assist the small scale agro producers in preserving and maintaining the quality of vegetables, to avoid the deterioration which may result in possible decline in market value. it was established that the lack of cheap and effective preservation methods has constantly created a problem for small scale farmers in the country. three cooling system concepts were generated. the best solution was chosen by the use of binary dominance matrix for further development into a detailed design development. simulations were done using solid works on the operations of the unit. also cost and evaluations were carried to test the feasibility of the concept implementation. it was recommended that tests be carried out before large scale production of the refrigerator to accommodate any relevant practical adjustments for functionality. key words food, preservation, vegetables, small scale, agro producers, cooler, post-harvest losses 1. introduction in zimbabwe, agriculture forms an important role in ensuring food security. the diverse agro-climatic conditions prevailing in the country enables the growing of many crops and vegetables (narman 1991). there is need to reduce the deterioration process of vegetables thus making possible an appreciable gain in terms of shelf life and marketing periods (james and james 2013).most people in the country rely on selling agricultural produce to earn a living and they are also involved in farming to ensure they have food for their families. small scale farmers grow vegetables and fruits. most of the post-harvest losses incurred on agricultural produce are mainly due to inadequate produce preservation or storage facilities. the vegetables need to be as fresh as possible for good market value. vegetables like tomatoes always create problems for storage and transportation because they are perishable in nature. such losses are significant in developing countries due to less investment in produce preservation. in developing countries, statistics show that post-harvest loss ranges from 20 to 50% (kader 1992). it is against this background that some study is necessary to develop a cooling system that is affordable, environmentally friendly and big enough to store varied vegetable produce. lower quality vegetables has reduced market value, there is need to create an effective produce preservation method for small scale. 2. background chilling increases the life of food before any signs of decay are identifiable. the process involves the lowering and maintaining of the temperature of a product such that bad changes which can occur to the quality of the produce are significantly reduced. these changes include growth of microorganisms, color changes and loss of nutrients and moisture (james and james 2013). temperature reduction sometimes increases a food nutrient value. lower temperatures decrease significantly microbial activity (james and james 2013). consumers regard chilled food to be the ones closest to the highest value of freshness due to the ability of freezing to increase a product’s life and maintain product nutritional value for long periods (pham 2008). temperature is the major factor as it affects 1754",,"The research conducted throughout this study showed the importance of food preservation and how the evaporative cooling could be employed in food preservation. The developments and design of the cooling unit was important although there is need for continuous improvement for the design. This refrigerator unit is specific for vegetable since it does not freeze foods. It is effective in the preservation of vegetables (i.e. temperature values above 0 C ° ), but it is not able to freeze food below the 0 C ° mark. To make this a universal cooler, there is need to improve it so that it is able to freeze foods. It is recommended to use modern control electronic devices like microprocessors to adjust the temperature of the cooler. Other foods especially meats are best preserved when they are in frozen form, therefore there is need to improve the performance of this design. It is recommended that this unit can be improved on a larger scale for use on farms and market gardening units to store a variety of vegetables before taking them to the market in a fresh condition.","ignatio madanhire, clement shonhiwa and ngonidzashe mhuka university of zimbabwe, department of mechanical engineering, p.o. box mp167, mt pleasant, harare, zimbabwe imadanhire@eng.uz.ac.zw charles mbohwa university of johannesburg, department of quality management and operations management, p.o.box 524, auckland park 2006, johannesburg, south africa cmbohwa@uj.ac.za",
22,Development Of E-Waste Inventory Management Strategy:  Case Study,"this research study assessed the challenges faced in managing e-waste in the case study industrial area with a view to develop a sustainable e-waste management framework for e-waste generated by industries based in the vicinity. a questionnaire based survey was use to evaluate e-waste management methods currently implemented by industrial operators; and to establish challenges restricting e-waste management. effort was made to characterize the e-waste generated by various operations in the area. the survey established that resulting lack of e-waste strategy was attributed to low awareness levels, and lack of procedures or technology to manage e-waste hence no proper collection and disposal of e-waste, high growth of e-waste, lack of e-waste policy and stakeholder collaboration. the study recommended the development of a framework towards a sustainable e-waste management system which entails a process of e-waste inventory management routine, proper collection and recycling schemes as well as possible strategic and synergistic approaches towards e-waste management.","e-waste, collection, disposal, generation, recycling","The outcomes of the study would serve as a model when developing e-waste management systems for other industrial areas. Furthermore the research yielded the required background knowledge for the authorities, when they draft a policy to regulate e-waste. The research would also be an eye opener to the local investors to venture into the lucrative trade of e-waste recycling, a topic hardly mentioned in the local industry. This will enlighten local manufacturers that they can save a lot by reuse of the waste thus reduced sourcing for virgin raw materials as well as energy in processing them. The study raised awareness on the dangers associated with e-waste mismanagement hence saving the environment.","ignatio madanhire and kumbi mugwindiri university of zimbabwe, department of mechanical engineering, p.o box mp167, mt pleasant, harare, zimbabwe imadanhire@eng.uz.ac.zw charles mbohwa university of johannesburg, department of quality management and operations management, p. o. box 524, auckland park 2006, south africa. cmbohwa@uj.ac.za",
23,Development Of A Portable Motorized Car Jack  Ignatio Madanhire And Tapiwa Chatindo,"this study seeks to develop a motorized car jack with maximum lifting capacity of 2 tons. the design incorporates an electric motor that is powered by a 12-volt battery of a small vehicle and the device would be connected through a cigarette lighter adapter in the vehicle. the common challenge with the currently available car jacks on the market is that they are manually operated and need a substantial amount of physical effort is required to lift the vehicle. the authors generated three possible solution concepts based on simple engineering techniques and knowledge of existing jacks. binary dominance matrix analysis was used to evaluate and determine the best solution for further development into a detailed design. solid works 2016 software was used to simulate the operation and loading of the resultant design. the purpose of this study is to try and modify the design of the already existing car jack in use. key words jack, hydraulic, motorized, design, vehicle 1. introduction in existence there are a range of car jacks that are designed to lift a vehicle from the ground. most of these are however manually operated which implies that they require extra physical effort from the operator. this may mean that it is not easy for elderly and handicapped to operate them. for operation of these jacks, operators are required to be in prolonged squatting position for some duration which can lead to the problem of backache. world over the car jack is an essential device all car owners should possess to assist in servicing their car when need arises and normally, the need is often necessitated by flat tires that need repair or replacement. this study seeks to reduce labor in the car lifting process using a jack as most car jacks are manually operated there is need to modify them and incorporate them with a prime mover system which replaces manual handling of jacks during operation making it easier and reducing drudgery during maintenance operations. also time consumption in the process of hoisting a vehicle will be reduced as using the available manually operated car jacks is a very time consuming process, thus there is need to design a motorized jack that improves the timeliness and efficiency in lifting. there will be reduced risk of injury as it is known that for a car jack to be hoisted, the operator has got to be near the vehicle and operating close to the vehicle during jacking is risky, so to reduce the risk of getting injury in the case of malfunctioning of the device the motorized jacking system enables operator to be at a safe distance during the jacking process. 2. background during road-side emergency like tire puncher, a jack is required to lift the vehicle (choudhary 2016). it has also been noted that the roadside assistance to come and assist, is not readily available in the remote rural roads of the country. vehicle workshops are equipped with hi-tech car lifting system where vehicles are raised and lowered using an electrically powered system. however, this is not the case for portable lifting devices. due to the high cost, maintenance and size, such lifting devices have been found to be mostly confined to work in workshops only and such functionality can neither be placed in car nor be owned by vehicle owners. hence there is need to design a motorized portable car jack that does not only reduce human efforts but also save time needed to repair the vehicle and that is easy and safe to use. this will be an advantage when it comes to replacing a vehicle tire on the roadside. 1746",,The principle of the existing car jack was modified by making adjustments and using a prime mover which is the electric motor to control the lifting operation of the jack. The car battery (12V) is used to supply power source to the motor. Human effort was eliminated in raising the jack by the use of the torque generated by the motor as in rotates. The use of long cablings to control the motorized operation meant the jack would be safe to use as the operator can use the jack in a comfortable position and as far away from the vehicle as possible. The torque supplied to the system is more than enough to lift a vehicle weighing around 2000 kg (2 ton). This design of the motorized carjack can considered to be a huge benefit in the lifting and lowering of 2 ton vehicles.,"university of zimbabwe, department of mechanical engineering, p.o box mp167, mt pleasant, harare, zimbabwe imadanhire@eng.uz.ac.zw charles mbohwa university of johannesburg, department of quality management and operations management, p. o. box 524, auckland park 2006, south africa cmbohwa@uj.ac.za",
24,Computational Intelligence For Process Optimization In  Casting Industry,"the manufacturing process optimization problems are complex owing to the non-linear relationships and interactions may occur among process factors. traditionally, engineers commonly employ the experimental design to resolve the problem. however, the experimental method has some limitations in practice. this study applies computational intelligence approaches to solve the process optimization problem. a real case study of a casting company located in taiwan is demonstrated. in this case, the process output, tensile strength, is the larger the better. first, engineers from different areas of expertise formed a team and field-based data were collected for process improvement. based on engineering knowledge, the project team identified some possible factors that may affect the tensile strength. then, feature selection techniques, including neural network, regression analysis, support vector machine, random forest, and rough set theory were implemented to screen out the important process factors that affect the process output. the final key process factors for further study were selected by the majority rule. next, the team utilized these key process factors to predict the tensile strength by using the backpropagation neural network. the trained network, describing the relationship between the process factors and the process output, was employed as the fitness function in the genetic algorithm. the control factor values were then transformed into a chromosome to represent the potential solution. by setting appropriate parameters, genetic algorithm was used to optimize the solution. in this study genetic algorithm was executed in several runs and the best solution from each run was saved. the optimal solution with the highest tensile strength was selected from these possible solutions. by using this optimal solution in the manufacturing process, the case company can significantly improve the product quality and reduce manufacturing costs.","feature selection, neural network, genetic algorithm",,"li-fei chen department of business administration fu jen catholic university new taipei city, taiwan 075033@mail.fju.edu.tw chao-ton su and ya-yu dong department of industrial engineering and engineering management national tsing hua university hsinchu, 30013, taiwan ctsu@mx.nthu.edu.tw",
25,Determining The Benefits Of The Engineering Mentoring  Programmes For Graduates,"engineering graduates’ inability to apply theoretical knowledge in practice has become a challenge during the graduates’ transition into the industry. engineering graduates require the competence to apply theoretical knowledge. through experiential learning, and with the assistance of a senior and/or experienced professional acting as mentors, this is achievable. this study explores the perspectives of academic and industry professionals with an engineering, construction and academic background on what benefits mentoring provide in getting the engineering graduates to build the relevant practical skills. a qualitative research approach using semi-structured interviews was conducted with participants. the study findings based on the analysis of data collected shows that through mentoring graduates accelerate career development, experiential learning, and skills development. mentoring can foster the acquisition of the practical skills required for the engineering graduates to be attracted, integrated and established in the industry. graduates also become aware of the significance of mentoring in exposing them to experiential learning and professional development. they are therefore better informed to participate in mentoring. organisations and employers therefore become more encouraged to support mentoring programmes in generating competent human capitals.","mentoring, that is","Mentoring has been established from literature to be beneficial in the area of experiential learning and practical skills acquisition. Most specifically, mentoring has been associated with career, academic, and personal development. Through mentoring, the engineering graduates have access to opportunities to acquire the needed practical skills and gather the knowledge necessary for the industry. Thus, engineering graduates are encouraged to access mentoring as senior professionals share experience and transfer knowledge to assist them in acquiring the needed practical skills. Participants in this study gave the benefits that mentoring provides as; career development, experiential learning, and skills development. It is clear from the findings and literature reviewed that the impact of mentoring on graduates’ professional and personal development can be quite significant. This study details the benefits associated with mentoring. The perspectives shared by the participants suggest that mentoring will have a significant impact on graduates’ personal and professional development with resulting effects for experiential learning. The literature on mentoring is increasingly demonstrating that mentoring has significant benefits including its impact in experiential learning. Students and young graduates are the future generation of professional engineers and they depend on the senior professionals to access relevant experience. The senior engineering professionals have a part to play in getting the students and young graduates competent. The senior engineering professionals should therefore be accessible and be willing to share experience and transfer knowledge to the younger generation. Mentoring assists students and graduates to have access to experiential learning and practical skills acquisition. A carefully organised mentoring experience or opportunity can significantly impact their experience in project based learning. Overall, the recognition and practice of mentoring in this crucial environment shows how vast and how beneficial it is.","ozofu akerele, andre vermeulen and annlizé marnewick postgraduate school of engineering management faculty of engineering and the built environment university of johannesburg auckland park, johannesburg, south africa ozofuijb@yahoo.com, avermeulen@uj.ac.za, amarnewick@uj.ac.za",
26,The Efficient And Precision Nature Within The Cyber  Physical Systems (Cps) And Industry 4.0 Technologies In,"this paper reviews the extent of the disruptive nature of industry 4.0 technologies applied to existing manufacturing industries. the inherent efficient and precision nature presented within the cyber physical systems (cps) and the nine pillars of industry 4.0 technologies will increasingly exploit industry operations. this development of strategies and the impact thereof is significant for the drivers impacting on competitive forces within industry as well as consumers across the globe. the paper objective will therefore by means of research study illustrates how to (i) critically analyse the current developments of the nine pillars industry 4.0 (ii) identify the dynamics of cps’s in the short term and (iii) how a multitude of exponential improvements can be realised for the early adopters of a digital strategy as a catalyst for increased organisational capability maturity through exponential continuous improvements and sustained innovation opportunities. the research results obtained therefore assisted in the design and testing of a comprehensive integrated lean six- sigma (lss), critical success factors (csf’s), design for six sigma (dfss) and cmmi framework interacting and supported by industry 4.0. the developed framework is undergoing testing at an international auto manufacturer in south africa. the framework will assist the organisation to optimise processes and product quality coupled with product performance transcending into successful capability maturity outcomes in the pursuit of increased customer loyalty.","capability maturity, industry 4.0","The final graphical representation of an integrated framework constructed (figure 3) was) made possible with analysis of standardised tools available and inputs in Phase A. The results of the extensive empirical research undertaken confirm the validity of the research objectives. The research objectives reliability and inter-correlation for CSF’s identified are high and acceptable. This would apply to all of the research objectives such as CSF’s confirmation for LSS and CSF’s establishment for DFFS (Research Objectives 1 and 2), the Contribution of CMM to LSS and DFSS implementation (Research Objective 3), the significance of Leadership in achieving, Capability Maturity (Research Objective 4) and how an integrated framework assist organisations to achieve Capability Maturity (Research Objective 5). It is concluded that the theoretical integrated Capability Maturity Model proposed in Figure 4 (CCMI 4.0) as well as the five Research Objectives identified and assessed are valid and provides for construct of a hybrid Continuous Improvement framework. This assumption is based on organisational capability maturity proposed in CMMI and ISO standards necessary for the dynamics of the technology influx presented to organisations in Industry 4.0. 156","industry operations. albert j. viljoen, andre vermeulen, jan-harm c. pretorius post graduate school engineering management university of johannesburg, auckland park, johannesburg, gauteng, south africa albertviljoen247@gmail.com, avermeulen@uj.ac.za, jhcpretorius@uj.ac.za","References

28,A Qualitative Review Of The Contribution Of Military  Leadership To The Humanitarian Supply Chain Operations,"the humanitarian operations arena and the humanitarian supply chain (hsc) in response to crises or disasters are times where the need for leadership is paramount. similar challenges to those of the hsc are encountered by the military in operations, this familiarity combined with a great emphasis on leadership of individuals, teams, and organisations make the military leader a significant asset to any hsc and humanitarian operation. this study assesses the contribution of the military to the hsc via a qualitative review of the experience and actions of those involved in humanitarian sphere. the findings grouped into themes support the view that engagement of the military in the hsc or in support of humanitarian operations has a positive effect overall, but specifically on leadership of the hsc. key words: military leadership, humanitarian operations, scm introduction the business of the military is leadership; however, this is not the only quality setting the military apart, coordination, capacity, readiness and broad ability to respond are some other factors. structured and trained to succeed on the battlefield, these skills and capabilities translate almost seamlessly into humanitarian operations, disaster response, famine relief and the provision of security. this is underpinned by familiarity with austere operating environments, and the inherent supply chain challenges, fragility, congestion, capacity issues and far bank control (the bridgehead or airport in country) and distribution; although the attributes are positive, paradoxically perhaps the presence and the influence of the military may not be considered so; this is supported by le riche (2004), in his review of the co-option of humanitarian aid in conflict zones. the use of military assets to provide assistance is a tempting proposition when seeking solutions to distant problems, however as smith (2008) points out frequently and in detail, there are limitations to ‘the utility of force’, and where the military is seen as an option careful consideration is necessary. these insights and those that follow, © ieom society international 2150",,"A limitation of this study is the military background of the majority of the interviewees, their deep understanding and experience of supply chains and the HSC made their responses valid and insightful. A balance was struck with the inclusion of a 3-PL provider, civil servant and an NGO clinician, with equal experience and understanding. This study has shown that leadership is understood to have a positive impact on HSC operations, it may not be expressed explicitly, but implied through other aspects of the HSC, communication, diplomacy, co-ordination, but it is always there, a central plank of the military approach to any and all operations. It is the incorporation into other aspects of the HSC which may explain the paucity of discrete papers devoted to leadership in the HSC. The pursuit an early acceptance of the military presence and the inherent capability within their organisation would enable NGO’s and OGD’s to concentrate on discrete aspects of their operations, identifying the population at risk and opportunities for longer term projects while allowing their supply chain specialists to benefit from the capacity and experience of military logisticians.","martin paul tynan school of economics, finance and management university of bristol bristol bs8 1tu guru prabhakar faculty of business & law, uwe bristol bs16 1qy uk guru.prabhakar@uwe.ac.uk tahir m nisar southampton business school university of southampton highfield, southampton so17 1bj uk","References

31,Relative Efficiency Of International Airlines  Antonio Henriques De Araujo Junior,"in this paper the results are published of a post-doctorate research done at the brazilian aeronautics technological institute (ita) in 2006. the purpose of this paper is to evaluate and to discuss the relative efficiency of the main brazilian carriers in the period from 2000-2006 by comparing their operational and relative efficiency with international airlines chosen from among benchmarks in this industry. these data, originally collected in 2008, were updated according to the iata yearbook for the period 2012-2016. for this purpose, the airlines were grouped into 3 classes: full cost companies (fcc’s), low cost companies (lcc’s) and regionals and 4 scenarios were established. in two of these scenarios (i and ii), they were compared, independently of the category and in two of them (scenario iii and iv) the comparison was established with airlines of the corresponding class (fcc’s and regionals). in the survey, 41 international carriers were selected in north and south american, european and asian markets. the method used in this research is the data envelopment analysis (dea), which is a well-known family of mathematical programming tools, based on the frontier approach. the results obtained with the utilization of software’s like ems, and frontier analyst allowed to conclude that large airlines with high load factors and a concomitant production of passenger and cargo had the best efficiency score.",effciency,"The objective of this paper is to compare the relative efficiency of Brazilian airlines with those of international companies. The research made possible the application of the DEA method with both variants VRS and CRS and with and without weight restrictions. It was not possible, however, in this research, to consider different operating conditions among American airlines that operate in a hub-and spoke system and South American and Asian companies operating point to point. The results obtained with the utilization of software’s like EMS, and Frontier Analyst allowed to conclude that large airlines with high load factors and a concomitant production of passenger and cargo like American Airlines, Delta Airlines and JAL had the best efficiency score. In scenario II, Air Berlin (LCC with 50 aircrafts and 80 destination) and Singapore Airlines, operating aircrafts intensively and in long distances, also achieved the efficiency frontier, as shown in Fig. 2. In scenario III, Air Berlin and Virgin Atlantic obtained a 100% relative efficiency with and without inputs weights restrictions. Among the Brazilian regional airlines, due to the personnel structure, both Passaredo and TAF, when compared under conditions of variable returns to scale, reached also, the efficiency frontier. In scenarios III and IV, GOL obtained a relative efficiency of appr. 76%. Among the American regionals, the US Airways, when compared under variable returns to scale, is also positioned on the efficiency frontier. Concerning the Asian LCC’s and regional airlines, the best performance was that of Air China with a 100% score of relative efficiency, when compared with variable returns to scale.

32,Algorithm For Integrated Problem Of Workforce Allocation  And Parallel Machines Scheduling With Sequence-Dependent,"machine scheduling is a common problem found in many manufacturing and service industry. in this study, the stated problem is imitated from real-world beverage industry. we consider integrated problem of workforce allocation and parallel machine scheduling with sequence-dependent setup time and machine eligibility restrictions. due to complexity of the problem, a rule-based heuristic is occurred to arrange production schedules in practice. though this heuristic could make planner arrange the schedule effortlessly, much time is wasted on unnecessary setup which causes the completion time of all job fall behind what it is supposed to be. to overcome this circumstance, the problem is formulated into mathematical model with the aim to minimize makespan. based on the result of the experiment, it can be concluded that the proposed model could obtain more effective result than those of the existing rule-based heuristic and lpt significantly.",,"Many effective algorithms for parallel machine scheduling were developed in the past several decades. Yet, there are only few studies that consider machine scheduling together with workforce allocation. Thus, this paper considers the integrated problem of workforce allocation and parallel machine scheduling with sequence-dependent setup time and machine eligibility restrictions production system, which is imitated from is imitated from real-world beverage industry. The mathematical model is proposed to solve such problem. The experiment was set to test the efficiency of the proposed mathematical model by comparing the results of the introduced model with those of the existing rule-based heuristic in real practice and the common LPT dispatching rule. The experimental results establish that the suggested model could reduce value of maximum completion time of all jobs from the existing rule-based heuristic and LPT significantly.","setup and machine eligibility restrictions arajabhorn chantavali and anan mungwattana department of industrial engineering kasetsart university bangkok, thailand arajabhorn@hotmail.com, fenganm@ku.ac.th",
33,The Impact Of Risk Analysis In Project Cost Calculation  Konstantin Novikov And Jana Kleinova,"assuming costs have a major impact for decision making of any project, comparing the variety of cost calculation alternatives, this article emphasis the certainty of a risk degree. risk is generally taken as part of business and working with affects the financial results of any company. so, it is considered as an uncertain event which leads to the possibility of losing. however, it can also be an opportunity. this research focuses on working with project-related risks, with a developed analyse on costs. in order to build a project budget, it is necessary not only to choose a suitable calculation method but above all is to identify all threats and opportunities and to analyse them thoroughly. furthermore, it is important to define the procedure by which the risk will be quantified. the output of the study is the design of an appropriate project cost management model.","project, risk, costs, budget","The aim of the study was to create a concept for calculating project costs, including the methodology of quantification of individual risks and their projection into the project budget. Firstly, basic information was provided on projects where not only the course of the project is but also the types of projects based on important criteria. The next part contains an overview of the used calculation methods, with examples of their application in projects. There is a considerable amount of risk and uncertainty about projects, so it is necessary to find out what models, degrees and types of risk exist and also, how to work with the risks and the possibility of their projection into the project reserve. The final chapter deals with the proposal of a suitable method of calculating project costs. The starting point is that the calculation will be made in the pre-investment phase of the project. This is a preliminary calculation method. Projects were divided into several groups according to their complexity and purpose. The risks were divided into continuous and discrete. Their evaluation will be done in one of 3 selected ways. Part of this work is also a table for selecting an appropriate method of risk quantification depending on selected criteria. A model for working with a threat or opportunity has also been created. This is followed by the risk creation process. The output of the article is a proposal for a project cost management model based on the PKR method. This method makes it possible to calculate the costs that are usually included in the manufacturing process in a procedural manner, thus making them transparent. While some cost items will continue to fall between overheads, we will be able to quantify and identify most of the related items specifically and identify the relevant measurement quantities for them. The next step will be to verify the usability of the proposed solution in practice. The model will be progressively upgraded and refined so that we can better integrate not only the costs but also the risks associated with the projects. 6.

34,Exploring The Potential Of New Technologies In Lean      Shopfloors: Do Industry 4.0 Resources Really Matter?,"this study examines the main industry 4.0 technologies that, according to the literature, might reinforce the capacity of lean manufacturing (lm) to improve plant performance. moving away from the existing studies that typically handle this question at a high level, we opted for a fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsqca), which enables multiple antecedents and their combinations to be identified to determine the outcome. necessary data were obtained from a multisector sample of 568 manufacturing plants (nace codes 15–37) from six european countries. the results support the argument that different causal paths among lm and industry 4.0 improve plant performance; however, contrary to the initial expectations, the findings revealed that industry 4.0 technologies (specifically digital technologies and additive manufacturing) seem to be, by themselves, sufficient conditions that can improve the results. in fact, in contrast to conventional lean wisdom, the findings suggests that in 4.0 technology-intensive shop floors, certain lean practices, those conceived for high volume-low variety (hvlv) manufacturing systems, might be counterproductive.","lean manufacturing, industry 4.0",,"antonio sartal faculdade de ciencias e tecnologia, universidade nova de lisboa, campus universitario, caparica 2829-516, portugal antoniosartal@uvigo.es josep llach mechanical and industrial engineering department campus de montilivi, 17071 girona josep.llach@udg.edu",
35,Organizational Tools And Cultural Change In The Success Of  Lean Transformations: Taking Stock And Looking Ahead,"the success rate of lm in non-japanese firms is extremely low. although many different reasons have been cited, two of them reflect a certain consensus. on the one hand, there is no agreement on which sequence to follow regarding organizational tools and cultural change during the transformation processes. on the other hand, there are also different views on what the correct rhythm should be. this article synthesizes and compares empirically the different theoretical perspectives on both issues and tests them in a wide dataset of 1,692 north american manufacturing firms. results suggest that cultural change totally mediates the relation between the deployment of tools and enhanced plant performance. while tools play therefore an essential role as triggers for stimulating lean transformations, our evidence proves quantitatively that they will only improve performance through the cultural change they can potentially provide. these findings not only allow for the integration of western and japanese approaches, but also suggest a tentative sequence and rhythm in the deployment of lean tools and values.","lean values, lean tools",,"to unravel the right sequence and rhythm antonio sartal faculdade de ciencias e tecnologia, universidade nova de lisboa, campus universitario, caparica 2829-516, portugal antoniosartal@uvigo.es xosé h. vázquez school of economics and business campus das lagoas/marcosende xhvv@uvigo.es",
36,A Dynamic Model For Sustainable Lean Six Sigma  Implementation,"lean six sigma (lss) methodology is becoming popular in south african companies, motivated by the drive to reduce costs and optimise operational processes. there are indications from literature of various challenges experienced by companies in their journey to implement and sustain lss. there is no authoritative statistics around the scale of lss implementations in south african organisations or on the success and failure rates of these implementations. this research’s chief objective was the development of a dynamic model which could be used to predict and sustain lss deployments in local companies. the research also purposed to expand the body of knowledge on factors affecting the sustainability of lss. multiple case studies were employed for concept building in this research. a three phased approach using interviews and a survey was employed in conducting the research. the research confirmed that companies were experiencing various challenges including lack of top management buy-in and support and lack of skilled and knowledgeable employees. positive feedback was received, as the measures of lss sustainability and existence of the predictors for lss sustainability received generally high scoring. the data collected from the case studies was limited as the population of employees who have received various levels of lss and actively participating in lss projects was limited within organisations. this research contributed to the body of knowledge by increasing understanding on the sustainability of lss implementations and by developing a dynamic model which could be used to predict and sustain lss deployments.","lean six sigma, sustainability, routinisation",,"tshavhuyo sesane, andre vermeulen, jan-harm c. pretorius post graduate school engineering management university of johannesburg, auckland park, johannesburg, gauteng, south africa tshavhuyo.sesane@gmail.com, avermeulen@uj.ac.za, jhcpretorius@uj.ac.za","References

37,The Mediating Roles Of Agility On The Impacts Of Sustainability On  The Performance Of The Oil And Gas Supply Chains,"this study investigates the relationships between agility and sustainability and the individual and combined impacts of both agility and sustainability on the performance of the oil and gas enterprises. this predicated upon the fact that whilst agility or sustainability has been corrected with organisational performance, there is no empirical study current that investigates the influence of agile practices on the extent to which organisations could translate sustainability practices into sustainability performance or overall organisational performance including the traditional financial measures and operational performance objectives. in particular, it is not clear if agility servers as an effective mediator or moderator of sustainability. this is significant given that sustainability has now become an important competitive objective. a survey of the oil and gas industry in the uk was carried out with a resulting response of 311 participating organisations. the oil and gas industry was chosen because of the impacts of its operations and products on the global carbon footprint. using a structural equation modelling (sem), the result indicates that agile practices are enablers of sustainable supply chain practices and that these capabilities play an important role in mediating the impacts of sustainability practices on competitive bases of profitability, flexibility, innovation, quality, speed and proactivity. these results also suggest that agile capabilities are necessary conditions for maximizing the impacts of implementation of sustainability practices on sustainability performance. in other words, the results show that enterprises with highly agile supply chains can benefits more from their efforts in implementing sustainability practices to improve overall organisational performance.",,,"dan’asabe godwin geyi, yahaya yusuf and david hanley lancashire school of business university of central lancashire preston, pr1 2he, united kingdom dggeyi@uclan.ac.uk, yyusu@uclan.ac.uk, dhanley1@uclan.ac.uk",
38,Extending Quality Culture In The Digital Age  Milton Krivokuca,"industry 4.0 provides many unique challenges for business leadership. the volumes of data availability reside in numerous locations, which were not even in existence a decade ago. the affordability of huge data storage and the new techniques of gathering data are resources that are in the nascent stages of development. within this new data frontier exists the human element of the business world. automation and artificial intelligence have replaced many repetitive jobs, while the need for knowledge workers continues to develop. the opportunities to apply innovation through the analysis and application of data are limitless. leadership must provide a method for taking advantage of the data, while developing their employee’s skills to become knowledge workers. this transition of employees to knowledge workers can be accomplished by specific application of several elements of the existing quality body of knowledge. a knowledge worker, as a member of a high performing team, is able to provide contributions to companies in their pursuit of organization excellence.","leadership, teamwork, quality processes",,"program chair emeritus master of science in quality assurance california state university dominguez hills carson, ca 90747 mkrivokuca16@gmail.com","References

39,Modelling Interdependencies Of Electrical Power Infrastructure By Using  Ism-Micmac Analysis,"the main purpose of this paper is to find the most critical substations (s/ss) in the electrical power infrastructure (epi) network, to give a better understanding for the top managers when decision performed. this paper discusses the interdependencies of epi through a real-life case-study to reveal the most critical parts of the network. by applying interpretive structural modelling (ism) method, the paper examines the physical interactions of thirty electrical substations in epi according to their influence. furthermore, the paper identifies the driving substations that can affect the others. the proposed model uses cross-impact matrix multiplication applied to classification (micmac) to analyse the driving power and dependence of each s/s. finally, based on the results, the paper concludes that the suggested approach can shape the foundation of a new method of epi network analysis for better decision-making. actually, the paper addressed a new way of investigating the epi network by using ism-micmac tool to give a wider figure for high authorities in the epi’s organization and give them the opportunity to allocate their resources in the most needed area of their the network.","interdependencies, substations (s/ss)","By finding the most critical substation in the EPI, this paper has met its main objective, through using a new analytical method into the electrical system network. The result shows that there are some critical substations need special care for preventing the system from been be disturbed. The paper also provides a general understanding of the interdependencies of EPI. Insights are provided regarding the importance of substations levels within the network. This is achieved by identifying and analysing the relationships among substations by using ISM mode and implementing the MICMAC technique to analyse the characteristics of each and every S/S in the network of EPI. The substations in MICMAC are categorized according to their driving power and dependence for finding their location on the plot clusters. Such a model can give a clear picture of the direct and indirect relationships among the substations of EPI and their dependencies, rather than considering those substations as isolated hubs in the network. In addition, the findings also show that from the sample of the Electrical Power Infrastructure - EPI of Sharjah Electricity & Water Authority - SEWA, power generation is the most critical substation among others. Another important point that even if the substations have the same characteristics, sometimes they have advantages on each other’s, in terms of locations and numbers of connected links, e.g. S/S 6 and S/S 7 in our case. The analysis of individual parts of each substation cannot give a clear idea of the network structure. However, the configuration of ISM with MICMAC, that was developed based on the perceptions and insights of experts, generates a broad result. This can be helpful to top management and can give more solid decisions efforts directing to tackle the root cause of any electrical network problems emphasis sustainability of electrical industry’s markets. This research paper is useful for specialists who are involved in policy implementation and planning for better protection of EPI’s substations. The paper will also be of great help to scholars who are concerned with an advanced analytical tool for EPI network, especially with such a case study where real data has been applied. Basically, the model was applied to a small sample of the electrical power network to prioritize substations based on their importance in the network. Nevertheless, the study needs to be extended to cover more substations in a much larger network in all of the five categories (Generation, Transmission, Distribution, Load-Station, and End-user), this is to reduce the complexity in a critical network such as EPI. In fact, the unity of generation substation could be a limitation for our paper. By default, when there is one power generation–substation, it will be the most critical hub in the network (As in our case). But the question is, what about if there is more than one power generation substation? In fact, this can raise a new future research question that if there are a redundancy of the same substations that have the same characteristics, which one of them is the most critical one and how the system will daffier the level of criticality between them?

43,Pre-Order Sales For Advance Selling With Capacity  Constraint,"two possible pricing formats are commonly used in advance selling: discount and premium that depends on the pre-order price is lower or higher than the spot selling price. discount price induces the early purchase of the customers who are uncertain about the quality of the product, and premium price grants the product availability for those who are eager to obtain the product. we use a two-period model, advance selling and spot selling to denote the profit optimization for a retailer who sells one product. the retailer faces two types of customers: novice customers who barely know the product and veteran customers who are familiar with the similar product. population size of these two types of customers and product capacity in the spot selling period affect the price decision in advance selling for the retailer. a stackelberg game is used to characterize the optimal price decisions, and in numerical study, several settings of scenarios are examined to gain more managerial insights.","advance selling, pre-order, price discount",,"kwei-long huang and cheng-tao hsu institute of industrial engineering national taiwan university taipei, 106, taiwan craighuang@ntu.edu.tw, r05546027@ntu.edu.tw",
44,Worm Optimization Algorithm For The Euclidean  Location-Allocation Problem,"facility location is a critical aspect of strategic planning for a broad spectrum of public and private firms. whether a retail chain sitting a new outlet, a manufacturer choosing where to position a warehouse, or a city planner selecting locations for fire stations, strategic planners are often challenged by difficult spatial resource allocation decisions. in fact, the literature reports that most of the models developed to solve the facility location problem are very hard to solve to optimality, as most problems are classified as np-hard. one of the toughest facility location problems is the location-allocation problem, which comprises of two elements – location: where to locate the central facilities; and allocation: which subsets of the demand should be served from each facility. the euclidean uncapacitated location allocation problem involves generating m new facilities to be located in r2, that will serve n fixed demand points with the objective of minimizing the transportation costs. supply centers such as plants and warehouses may constitute the facilities while retailers and dealers may be considered as demand points. this study addresses the euclidean location-allocation problem with an unknown number of facilities, and an objective of minimizing the fixed and transportation costs. since practical scenarios often require a large number of facilities and customers, heuristics for this problem became popular in the literature. accordingly, a worm optimization (wo) algorithm is introduced and is applied to this np-hard problem. the novel wo is based on the behaviors of the worm, which is a nematode with only 302 neurons. nevertheless, these neurons allow worms to achieve several intricate behaviors including finding food, interchanging between solitary and social foraging styles, alternating between dwelling and roaming, and entering a type of stasis/declining stage. wo’s performance is evaluated by comparing its solutions to solutions of two other known metaheuristics for the problem under study, and the extensive computational results indicated that the proposed wo performs best.","worm optimization, norfolk",,"jean-paul arnaout department of business administration gulf university for science and technology west mishref, kuwait arnaout.j@gust.edu.kw",
45,Project Portfolio Selection In Indian Auto Component  Industry: An Empirical Study,"project portfolio management (ppm) has a proven record of success in organizations. there is a growing set of literature focusing on the success criteria of ppm. these set of standards affect the ppm success and has an overall outcome on the business success in organizations. from the strategic perspective, project selection plays a substantial role. in the world of a dynamic market with colossal competition, taking up the wrong project will not only end up using resources but in the long run, it can be critical. indian auto component industry (iaci), due to varying demands and global competition, face the daunting task of survival in such a situation. the research paper is written on the empirical study and focusses on the effect of project selection in the portfolio on business success in iaci.",project selection,"To build an optimal project portfolio in a competitive business environment is a significant concern for every organization. The method of generating a good portfolio mix of components with excellent potential, with many constraints, is complicated and knowledge consuming. This complexity is mainly because of the numerous dimensions in decision making. The decision maker has to deal with multiple criteria, multiple objectives, uncertainty and risk, interdependencies between different components, and balancing effectively with varied goals of the organization. Mostly the decision is regularly made by top managers with dissimilar perspectives that need alignment of the projects across the portfolio building stages. Considering the increased competition in the market, there is a much broader scope of possible strategic directions that need the active participation of top-level management, which helps in navigating for both long and short-term strategy. It suggests that a commitment, both regarding actions and time, is desired. This also indicates that the management involved in operational aspects has to be supported with a proper project methodology on individual project level and also on a portfolio of projects. Project selection is indeed an essential phase in PPM. The results show that there is a good understanding of project selection is there in the organizations of IACI. But this can be only one side of the coin. A strategy should be accompanied with an in-depth plan of implementation of it. Without the effective implementation of the strategy, the probability of business success is reduced.","vilas j kharat national institute of industrial engineering mumbai, india vilas.kharat.2013@nitie.ac.in dr. b k r naik national institute of industrial engineering mumbai india dr.bkrnaik@gmail.com",

This method found the global optimum or an acceptable solution even in the case of the worst settings of this optimization method.

We tested all the SOMA strategies under the same conditions of the simulation experiments – the same termination criteria, number of repetitions in the series, and the same setting of the basic parameters of this optimization method.

47,Exponentially Weighted Moving Average Chart Employing  Curtailed Inspection For Monitoring Attributes,"exponentially weighted moving average (ewma) chart is one of the most powerful techniques for detecting small and moderate shifts. the curtailed inspection has been broadly used in acceptance sampling plans to reduce the average sample number substantially. this research presents an ewma chart employing curtailed inspection (curtailed ewma chart) to monitor the fraction nonconforming p of a process with attribute characteristics. a design algorithm is developed to optimize the charting parameters of the curtailed ewma chart. the proposed curtailed ewma chart is compared with the traditional ewma without curtailed inspection (abbreviated as ewma chart in this research) using the same false alarm rate to ensure a fair comparison. the overall detection ability of the charts is measured in terms of the expected average run length over a wide range of shifts, and the p shift is assumed to follow a uniform distribution. the findings of this research reveal that the curtailed ewma chart has a superior overall performance than the ewma chart without curtailed inspection. on average, the former is more effective than the latter by 35%, considering different circumstances. the high overall effectiveness of the curtailed ewma chart is mainly attributable to curtailed inspection.","control chart, average run length","This research proposes a binomial EWMA chart employing curtailed inspection for detecting increasing shifts in fraction nonconforming p. The curtailed inspection was able to considerably improve the overall detection effectiveness of the EWMA chart compared with that of the traditional EWMA without curtailed inspection. The developed curtailed EWMA chart is superior to the conventional EWMA chart under different settings. On average, the former is more effective than the latter by 35% in terms of expected average run length (EARL). The curtailed EWMA chart can be implemented using a well-developed procedure. Once the curtailed EWMA chart is designed, it can be used continuously as long as there is no change in the process and the improvement in detection speed can be gained. The observed ARL0 of the curtailed EWMA chart is usually very close to the desired false alarm rate, despite the discrete nature of attribute characteristics. In this article, the curtailed EWMA chart is implemented with a 100% inspection. It can also be used to detect increasing p shifts when sampling inspection is employed. Another prospective future work is to use the curtailed inspection to enhance the power of other control charts such as the time-between-events and synthetic control charts.

48,Meta-Analyses In Operations And Management Research:  What Can We Learn From Medicine?,"this paper analyzes the weaknesses of meta-analyses (mas) in the field of operations research and management using a more mature scientific field as a benchmark and source of inspiration for improvements: the field of medicine. in following this approach, we suggest that there are four areas in which common operations and management ma practices should improve: i) availability of information and replicability of primary research; ii) correct application of statistical support; iii) execution of heterogeneity analyses; and iv) standardization of results reporting. using a representative study on a management topic published in a reputable journal, we qualitatively identify the aspects that can be improved at each stage of the meta-analytic process as it is applied to management. we show the different results that could have been achieved by following procedures that are standard in the field of medicine, and we propose a standardization of the meta-analytic procedure - beyond statistical analysis - in which we incorporate various ‘good practices’ used in clinical research. overall, these recommendations are aimed at improving the transparency, credibility and replicability of the mas, which not only facilitates the building of cumulative scientific knowledge but also helps to validate the dialogue between academia and practitioners.",,,"antonio sartal faculdade de ciencias e tecnologia, universidade nova de lisboa, campus universitario, caparica 2829-516, portugal antoniosartal@uvigo.es miguel gonzalez-loureiro school of economics and business campus das lagoas/marcosende mloureiro@uvigo.es xosé h. vázquez school of economics and business campus das lagoas/marcosende xhvv@uvigo.es",

53,Comparison Of The Local Muscular Stress Of Men And  Women In The Industrial Sector,"in today´s hectic age, not only people who have a physically demanding job but also people who spend their workday at a computer have an experience with occupational illnesses. this type of activity does not seem to be physically demanding, but for people can be even more dangerous than heavy work. according to czech statistical office the most common occupational disease in the czech republic is the carpal tunnel syndrome, which can be caused by limb overloads (over 320 reported cases in 2017) or by vibrations (over 140 cases in 2017). not only people who works in manufacture, but also people who work in the office can suffer with this illness. in these days the carpal tunnel syndrome is the most common hand disorder and most affected are women. the number of women in industrial companies has been increasing since the economic crisis in 2008. as the data of the czech statistical office shows that in 2008 number of women in industrial companies was slightly over 450 thousand, in 2016 it was almost half a million. the czech statistical office shows international comparison of employment of women and men in industry in 2014. this comparison indicates higher gender equality in industry sector for women in the czech republic than in other countries of eu. compared to average number of employment of women and men in industry in eu 28 (females 10,9 %, males 31,4 %) the value is above-average (females 22,7 %, males 47,6 %). the carpal tunnel syndrome can be usually evaluated by integrated electromyography (surface electro-myo-graphy). this method is non-invasive and belongs to the experimental investigation methods that allow objective evaluation of neuromuscular activity by the registration of bioelectric potentials. on the muscles of the hand (extensors, flexors) are attached electrodes that sense the local muscular load. the paper is focused on comparison of emg results on the same working positions operated by men and women. a group of men and women from the czech population aged 30 to 55 were measured by integrated electromyography and evaluated. during measuring the local muscle stress on the hands of men and women, it was an effort to maintain a similar physical constitution and also age for a quantifiable comparison of the measured values.",emg,,"martin kába and ilona kačerová department of industrial engineering and management university of west bohemia univerzitní 8, pilsen, 301 00, czech republic kaba@kpv.zcu.cz, ikacerov@kpv.zcu.cz, buresm@kpv.zcu.cz",
54,Project Constraints In A Manufacturing Environment  Beyond The Iron Triangle,"the objective of this research was to determine the project constraints that must be considered to ensure project success in a typical manufacturing environment like a pulp and paper plant. the research methodology used to answer the research questions was a mixed –method approach. the modes of data collection were literature study, case studies and a survey questionnaire. the data was analysed using between-methods triangulation. the research presented was limited to data obtained within the south african pulp and paper industry. the research will give project managers, and anyone involved in execution of projects in a pulp and paper plant environment more insight and better understanding of which constraints to consider to ensure better project success rates. the research concluded that triple constraints are not the only determinants of project success in the pulp and paper plant. additional project constraints were identified were; risk; human resource management; legal requirements; technical performance","project management, project constrains, 2010) (taylor","and Recommendations The research questions were proven to be true. Q1: Triple constraints are not the only constraints to project success in a pulp and paper plant. Q2: There are other constraints that must be considered that contribute to project success in a pulp and paper plant. The additional constraints as triangulated from the literature review, case studies and survey are: • Risk (including market condition assumptions) • Human resource management (contractor management, scarce skills) • Legal requirements • Technical performance These findings were found to be in line with the current theories and perspectives in terms of project constraints. The (PMI, 2017). (Duggal, 2010), (Gress, 1997) other sources are all in agreement that project constraints are unique to each project and that the triple constraints are an outdated parameter. This study was based on a literature study, a limited number of secondary data as case studies and had a rather poor survey response rate. During the study it was evident that there is very limited information or literature on projects and project management in the Pulp and Paper Industry in general. There were little or no project management statistics obtainable. It is recommended that a study be done into the status of project management within the Pulp and Paper industry in South Africa to build up knowledge in this area. From this study it can be recommended that the additional constraints be taken into consideration as project success limiting criteria in order to improve the chances of project success.","moloko masopoga, a wessels and jhc pretorius, postgraduate school of engineering management, faculty of engineering and the built environment, university of johannesburg, south africa jhcpretorius@uj.ac.za; mochokwe@yahoo.com; awessels@gmail.com",

56,Parametric Optimization Of Wire Electrical Discharge  Machining (Wedm) For Inconel 800 Using Artificial Neural,"the ever-increasing demand for complex product geometries along with superior product features has led to a rapid increase in the use of super alloys. however, the difficulty in machining of these alloys had made non-traditional machining processes an attractive substitute to conventional machining. in this paper, an attempt has been made to optimize the performance parameters namely material removal rate (mrr) and overcut in machining of inconel 800 alloy by wedm using artificial neural network (ann). this is achieved by performing the experiments according to the taguchi l16 orthogonal array. different ann network structures were developed and compared taking into consideration pulse on time (ton), pulse off time (toff), current (i) and servo voltage (sv) as the controlled parameters for identifying the optimal network. the predicted results were found to have a close consensus with the experimental values.","wedm, mrr, overcut, rocket engines","On the basis of experimental values of Ton ,Toff , I , SV, MRR and overcut, the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for WEDM process is structured in MATLAB using nntool. The optimal network structure 4-8-8-2 with R-value of 0.99794 is obtained from 15 different network structures. It has been seen that the predicted MRR follows a similar trend as the experimental MRR. However, the optimal network predicted approximately 16% more MRR for 16th run order. The minimum absolute percentage error for the network was found to be almost zero whereas the maximum absolute percentage error was 15.61%. Similarly, the predicted overcut also follows a similar trend to the experimental overcut. The minimum absolute percentage error for the network was found to be almost zero whereas the maximum absolute percentage error was 13.25%. Hence it can be concluded that the network structure 4-8-8-2 provides the best result for the four selected controlled parameters and the two performance parameters in ANN. Based on an exhaustive survey of literatures available,expert opinion and preliminary experimentations, the four most significant input process parameters were selected for the present study. However, the effect of other process parameters on the machining process were not investigated and can be a scope for future work. Besides it is very difficult to consider all parameters of WEDM at a time due to the complexity of the process itself. Finally other optimizing and predictive methods like Polynomial Neural Network (PNN), Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH) etc can also be used for parametric optimization of WEDM for Inconel 800.","network prasenjit dutta assistant professor department of production engineering, nit agartala jirania, tripura – 799046 e-mail: dutaprasenjit@yahoo.com subhash chandra panja professor department of mechanical engineering, jadavpur university kolkata 700 032 e-mail:panja12@yahoo.co.in pawan kumar research student department of production engineering, nit agartala jirania, tripura – 799046 e-mail: pa1.kush5@gmail.com debashis sarkar principal asansol engineering college, asansol, india e-mail: aecdeba.me@gmail.com",
57,Effective X-Bar&R Chart For Monitoring   Aluminum Extrusion Process,"aluminum extrusion is considered as one of the very challenging processes to produce good quality and low cost products. this paper presents an optimization design of the x &r chart for effective statistical monitoring of output of aluminum extrusion process. the proposed optimal x &r chart is compared with traditional 3-σ x &r chart, in terms of the average extra quadratic loss (aeql), for detecting a wide range of shifts in the mean and variance. the results reveal that the optimal x &r chart overtakes the 3-σ x &r chart by 94%, in terms of aeql. in addition, the former has the smallest out-of-control average time to signal (ats) over almost all shifts. consequently, the replacement of traditional x &r chart by the optimal one is recommended to detect the mean and variance shifts more efficiently and as a result, reduce the process variation and avoid economic loss.","aluminum extrusion, control chart, die geometry","This study aims at improving the effectiveness of detecting shifts in mean and variance in the aluminum extrusion process in a manufacturing plant, and hence lowering the number of defective items produced.

58,"The Re-Formulation For Single Item Capacitated Lot Sizing  Problem With Shortage, Inventory And With","over the ongoing time we all are facing the impact of ‘climate change’, which is also known as ‘global warming’ or in other words “an unnatural weather change”. one of the significant reasons are increase in level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. now a day, the main concern of the researchers is to discover how to reduce the carbon discharge to decrease the unnatural weather change. ​in our study, we investigate how firms manage carbon footprint in lot sizing problem under ‘carbon emission trading’ mechanism. so, we used the concept of pochet and wolsey’s capacitated lot sizing problem formulation and give a new formulation with carbon footprint constraints. the problems under consideration are single level, the single item production problem with a finite time planning horizon and the demand is also deterministic. we also consider the shortage cost. as per our knowledge in the literature, there is no such work has been done over single item capacitated lot sizing problem with shortage variable and with strict carbon cap constraint. we considered initial inventory and end period shortage is zero (i​0 ​= s​t​.= 0) also, for shortage cost, in earlier formulations are unable to eliminate them; however, our formulation is able to eliminate all shortage (we used the concept from shrama et al (2017)). this is a solid theoretical contribution as it offers significant computational savings.","​lot sizing problem, carbon footprint, carbon cap",,"strict carbon cap piya ghosh industrial and management engineering department indian institute of technology kanpur, india piyagh@iitk.ac.in rrk sharma industrial and management engineering department indian institute of technology kanpur, india rrks@iitk.ac.in","References

59,Delay Analysis In Energy Utility Maintenance Project,"during operation in the coal-fired power plant, the cyclic operation of the plant exposes components and systems such as boilers to high pressure and temperature, resulting in mechanical and thermal fatigue damage. like most engineered systems, maintenance of these boilers is required to improve the availability and safety of the plant. however, delays are common in the execution of these maintenance projects. this study explored factors contributing to delays and their effects on boiler maintenance during half station shut down in a coal-fired plant. the study adopted a qualitative approach using project documents and open-end questionnaires as a data source. the findings identified sixteen factors contributing to delays, and twelve effects thereof. additionally, mitigation for dealing with contributing factors is also presented. the study results can assist practitioners working in boiler maintenance to adopt a proactive approach to manage delays and contributes to the global field of knowledge.","boiler, delays, effects",,"kibala adiam and hannelie nel postgraduate school of engineering management university of johannesburg johannesburg, south africa k_adiam@outlook.com; hannelien@uj.ac.za",
60,Organizational Culture And Performance: Mediating Role Of  Sustainable Supply Chain Management Practices,"the concept of sustainable supply chain management (sscm) has received increasing recognition in both theory and practice. current dependency on the oil and gas industry for economic development and social activities necessitates research into the sustainability of the industry’s supply chains. previous studies on sscm practices in the industry have paid little attention to context dependent factors that either enable or hinder progress towards sustainability in a supply chain. our aim is to address this gap by exploring the relationship between organizational culture and sscm practices, as well as the resultant effect of this interaction on performance outcomes. specifically, this study examines sscm as one possible explanatory mechanism through which an organization’s culture influence its performance. a survey of 192 oil and gas companies was conducted. the data collected was analyzed using structural equation modelling. the results provide evidence that sscm practices mediate the culture-performance relationship. thus, managers should ensure that sscm is embedded in their organizational culture in order to achieve greater sustainability performance. for instance, organizations could pursue characteristics of the culture that enable innovation and risk-taking, and aim at increasing long-term value, rather than short-term economic benefits.","sustainability, oil and gas",,"yahaya yusuf and tanimu dandutse lancashire school of business and enterprise university of central lancashire preston, pr1 2he, uk yyusuf@uclan.ac.uk, tdandutse@uclan.ac.uk",
61,Outsourcing Business Activities: A Decision Tree For  Systematic Evaluation,"in today’s rapidly evolving market, it is difficult for startup companies to survive if they do not have a high-growth profile. scholars believe that either the startups expand rapidly to capture major market segment or they slowly die out. large companies usually outsource non-core activities to invest additional resources in the core activities, whereas, expanding startups have limited flexibility and have to outsource business activities in order to survive the high-growth expectation of the market. with limited resources at the entry level, startups certainly have no other choice except outsourcing business activities. there are various advantages and disadvantages of outsourcing depending on the business the company is operating in. various companies fall into the trap of outsourcing activities that are important to keep inhouse. the present study offers a decision tree comprising the most critical parameters that enables the user to differentiate activities to be kept in-house from those to be outsourced. these parameters include measuring the business activity on the basis of standardisability or specifiablity, receiving input for innovation, establishing proper barriers to entry in place, and keeping correct contract agreements setup with the suppliers.","outsourcing, decision tree","Outsourcing has various advantages and disadvantages. However, for startup companies aiming to become a high growth company, outsourcing is nearly vital. The present study highlights four major parameters to be considered while determining to outsource business processes. They are parameters like measuring standardisability or specifiablity of the activity, receiving input for innovation, having barriers to entry in place, and keeping correct contract agreements setup with the suppliers. The present study has emphasised that startup companies cannot overlook these foremost parameters while outsourcing business activities. These parameters are arranged in a decision tree with easy ‘yes’ and ‘no’ options so that they can be applied by the leaders of startup companies to decide which activities to outsource and which to keep inhouse.","muhammad ahmad tauqeer and knut erik bang department of mechanical and structural engineering and material science university of stavanger stavanger, 4036, norway muhammad.a.tauqeer@uis.no, knut.e.bang@uis.no",
62,Insights From Control Science For The Management Of  Technology,"control science is more than an engineering discipline. its record of success in engineering applications—enabling the design of systems that were previously impossible, improving performance and reliability, and achieving cost-efficiencies in design and operation—can be traced to underlying principles that are universally relevant for all dynamical systems. indeed, it is not a stretch of the imagination to claim that, “control science is the only rigorous approach to optimized decision making in complex dynamical systems”! advanced control has had tremendous economic and societal impact in engineering. facts and figures from various industry sectors (including industrial processes, commercial buildings, aircraft and spacecraft, and automotive) attest to the benefits achieved—e.g., $1 additional profit per barrel for oil refineries. advanced control systems comprise elements such as sensors, actuators, models, estimators, and optimization, and involve distributed, decentralized, and hierarchical control architectures. with this background, we can explore how technology management, as manifest in project management, innovation initiatives, portfolio allocation, and the like, can profit from a systems science perspective. this is not just a matter of drawing a management activity as a feedback control loop. control science provides insights that can enlighten managerial decision makers and lead to improved decision-making performance. about ten such “insights” have been compiled. i outline a few here: • all advanced control relies on models of the system under control. in fact, all “informed” (i.e., nonrandom) decision making by people is also based on models—except in this case the models are in the crania of the decision makers! • feedback is essential for counteracting uncertainty. if we have no uncertainty about how a system—whether engineered or organizational—will perform in response to different inputs (i.e., with a perfect model and absent noise or disturbance) we can dispense with feedback and just give a “feedforward” command. for higher (e.g., faster) performance in the face of uncertainty, however, both feedforward and feedback are needed. • adaptation and robustness are often used interchangeably in common parlance. in control science these two terms have different meanings. adaptation refers to the ability to change the control law (or decision-making heuristics) as the environment or the system changes, 361",,,"tariq samad technological leadership institute university of minnesota minneapolis, mn 55455 u.s.a. tsamad@umn.edu",

With regard to answering the question on, how to improve ISO 17025 quality management system within coal testing division? there must be an enforcement of customer requirements awareness to ensure everyone within coal testing division is familiar with customer requirements. Creation of an effective and open communication system on quality policy and objectives for all coal testing division personnel is vital. There must be an empowerment managed by designated personnel stationed in each laboratory to ensure an ongoing improvement of ISO 17025 quality management system which will result in the reduction of reaction time to quality related issues. Coal testing division staff at all levels must be provided with education and training providing to equip them with the necessary knowledge to allow them to continuously improve ISO 17025 quality management system. An effective customer communication system must be established within coal testing division for providing customer service information, handling of enquiries, orders and customer feedback. Measuring and monitoring system must be established for service conformity to ensure all customer needs are met. There must be a creation of a system for identification and control of non-conformances and to prevent their unwanted use.

But it needs improvements in reducing the size of the enumeration tree, which is reduced in the OptPack Algorithm by using the tree dominance rule. The limitation of this research is related to the constraints of workstations, so this research cannot be generalized to the automobile industry in all the cases. So, in the future, this research can be done with the optimization and minimization of those constraints.","salah eddine ayoub el ahmadi, laila el abbadi, moulay taib belghiti national school of applied sciences ibn tofail university kenitra, morocco salaheddineayoub.elahmadi@uit.ac.ma laila.elabbadi@uit.ac.ma moulaytaib.belghiti@uit.ac.ma",

66,Understanding Supply Chain Resilience: A Dynamic  Approach Using Theory Of Constraints Current Reality Tree,"supply chain management involves adapting to changes in complex global network of organizations, and thus we will not examine it as a set of sequential, vertically organized transactions representing successive stages of value creation but as a whole system. operational complexity and dispersion are making the supply chain more vulnerable to risks. in recent years, there have been a number of high-profile events and persistent problems that have severely disrupted the ability of firms to produce and distribute their products, including devastating earthquakes, political turmoil, fuel crises, diseases and terrorism. evidence suggests that a firm that responds to a disruption better than its competitors could improve its market position. our study focus on identifying critical success factors in supply chain resilience and understanding causal relationships between them. in this paper we consider the supply chain resilience as a complex system as we describes it with an application of a systems approach known as the current reality tree from the theory of constraints, the study was conducted in a group-based model-building environment with a group of students who specialized either in supply chain management or process engineering science. we developed our conceptual model including supply chain robustness, agility, flexibility and visibility to deal with resilience complexity and we suggest that understanding the dynamic nature of supply chain resilience through cause and effect relationships is critical to build future resilient strategies","supply chain, resilience",,"mohamed hicham salah eddine research team amips, ecole mohammadia d’ingénieurs, mohammed v university in rabat, morocco medhichamsalaheddine@research.emi.ac.ma tarik saikouk international logistics and supply chain department international university of rabat saikouk@gmail.com abdelaziz berrado research team amips, ecole mohammadia d’ingénieurs, mohammed v university in rabat, morocco berrado@emi.ac.ma",
67,The Impact Of Payment Delays On The Financial Resilience Of A  Multi-Echelon Supply Chain: A System Dynamics Simulation,"using system dynamics modeling and simulation on a moroccan retail industry, we investigate wether and how delay in payment enhance supply chain resilience. potential risks for the retailer’s resilience performance include the possibility of a mismatch between supply and demand, as well as serving the store inefficiently and causing on-shelf stock-outs due to the lack of cash-flow, thus, resilience is determined by investigating the dynamic behaviour of stocks, shipment responses, cash in hand, and invoices payments. we show that retailer’s that face liquidity shocks are more likely to default on their market response, especially when the shocks are unexpected, supply chain partners with little liquidity, are likely to be credit constrained or are close to their debt capacity. credit constrained firms would thus pass one their liquidity shocks on to their suppliers down the trade credit chain,we show that firms provide liquidity insurance to each other and that this mechanism is able to alleviate credit constraints. the method allows insights into the system structures that would not be evident using simulation alone, including a better understanding of the influence of control parameters on dynamic behaviours, and the impact of payment delays on supply chain resilience. 1. introduction over the course of history, supply chains have emerged to meet the diverse needs of human societies, to exploit natural resources, and to enable humans to engage profitably in commerce and trade. (casson, m. (2013). the very extensive supply chain literature addresses supply chain practices and performance ( swink et al., 2007; flynn et al., 2010), supply chain strategies and their dynamics over time ( ketchen & giunipero, 2004; skjøtt-larsen et al., 2007), and to some degree addresses changing supply chain configurations ( halldorsson et al., 2007; ülkü & schmidt, 2011), as manager strive to improve factory performance, the trouble is that often the meaning is lost (zeng et al ; 2017), while interest in scm is immense, it is clear that much of the knowledge about scm resides in narrow functional silos such as purchasing, logistics, it and marketing(burgess et al ,2006), the different interactions constitutes a complex set of relationships among buyers and suppliers, between a buyer and a supplier as well as between competing suppliers (nair et al, 2008), so the supply chain management involves adapting to changes in a complicated global network of organizations (pathak et al, 2007), and thus we will not examine it as a set of sequential, vertically organized transactions representing successive stages of value creation (mabert & venkataramanan, 1998) but as a whole system. managers must possess a mental model of a supply chain management that more accurately reflects its true underlying complexity and dynamism. (choi et al, 2006), so due 410",,"This paper presents findings of a simulation that managers can use to unlock the power of delay in payments along the cross cutting themes identified in the study. The findings show that the payment delays is a nowaday necessary tool to do business and supply chains should embrace it in order to build superior capabilities which can become a decisive competitive advantage. Organizations need to leverage the information across supply chain to share the real time information, better understand customers, optimize supply chains and human resources, improve financial metrics and develop the critical insights for decision making.

68,Production Of Tailored Reinforcement Of  Rattan  Fiber Composite,"the growing demand of composite for variety applications are facing the depletion of petroleum resources, had made many researchers focuses on using natural materials. rattan as one of them, are prepared in a woven tailored to reinforced epoxy based matrix, this aimed to partially reduce the synthetics. the fibers are previously conducted in alkali to optimize the cohesiveness of fibers into the matrix. the synergistic effect of adhesives silane and dimethylethanolamine (dmea) into rattan woven can be boosted on shortening the curing time which results to an ultimate property of composite and reduces the production cost. the porosity and a hydroxyl content of fibers are might be obstacles to the series process which can be affected to the failures of maximizing the toughness of the product. the proper treatment can solve these problems.","production, ultimate property, thermal",Some considerations on making composites from rattan fiber naturally have relatively high levels of water content the process of dispersing fibers in the matrix will not be effective. Thus giving dimension instability of the final product. Natural fibers are generally hydrophilic so are not compatible with the most matrix. To increase the wetting ability of fibers the surface needs to be modified so it becomes hydrophobic. Adding adhesive booster to the formula is much reduce the production cost because the curing time has reached the short time of production.

70,Optimal Inventory Control Policies For Avoiding Food  Waste,"considering that 120 million people in the eu face the risk of poverty or social exclusion, while at the same time a 35% of perishable food is unnecessarily discarded at supermarkets, the redistribution of the perishable food surpluses could provide a complete and balanced diet for almost 60.000 people a day or an equivalent reduction of ~100 million € per year expenses in poverty confrontation. moreover, the reduction of food waste through the timely donation to facilities that support socially vulnerable groups of a small amount of a food product (that most probably will end up to waste), could significantly promote a company’s corporate social responsibility (csr) policy. under this context, the purpose of this paper is to explore inventory control policies that at a specific time instance close to the expiration date donate food when the inventory level is above a certain threshold and thus, reduce the expected amount to be disposed at the expiration date. analytic and numerical models are employed in a single period setting to calculate optimal order quantity and threshold values that maximize the company’s profit. numerical experimentation for a specific case discusses the conditions under which the proposed policy is feasible.","food waste, inventory planning",,"dimitrios vlachos department of mechanical engineering, aristotle university of thessaloniki, p.o. box 461, 54124 thessaloniki, greece center for interdisciplinary research and innovation (ciri-auth), balkan center, buildings a & b, thessaloniki, 10th km thessaloniki-thermi rd, p.o. box 8318, gr 57001 vlachos1@auth.gr ioannis mallidis centre for research and technology hellas hellenic institute of transport 6th km charilaou-thermi rd., 57001, thermi, thessaloniki, greece imallidi@auth.gr volha yakavenka department of mechanical engineering, aristotle university of thessaloniki, p.o. box 461, 54124 thessaloniki, greece vyakaven@auth.gr",
71,Assessment Of Wind Farm Allocation Criteria  Mawadda M. Samkari And Abdulaziz T. Almaktoom,"in keeping with the urgent goals of maintaining a healthy environment and providing clean energy alternatives at reasonable prices, saudi arabia is moving towards electricity generation using wind. selecting optimal wind farm locations is an important challenge in which one seeks to reduce the levelized cost of electricity. a four-level multi-criteria decision-making model was developed that used the analytic hierarchy process to consider wind availability, electricity demand, employment costs, maintenance costs, infrastructure costs, sale prices, and energy production capabilities to optimize wind farm locations. in addition, this study introduced multiple factors that affect wind farm success. in this study, the analytical hierarchy process was implemented using mathematical simulations to compare three wind farm locations in saudi arabia.","renewable energy, wind farm, 2018",", the AHP is not sufficient for identification of a suitable wind farm location. Further studies should be performed. Thus, this area of research will continue to adopt other techniques to achieve its objectives. 5. Conclusions Wind farm turbine technology can make important contributions to the energy needs of Saudi Arabia. This study presented a model that can be improved to help in developing a model that help in reducing energy costs. This study used the AHP, which is an MCDM method, to rank and evaluate wind farm allocation criteria. Due to the weaknesses of the AHP in multi-level ranking and dealing with quantitative data, further studies should integrate other methods to help achieve better rankings. It is recommended to extend the study and use other MCDM techniques that are more effective in ranking multi-level problems using qualitative and quantitative data. To overcome this gap, the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) described in Choudhary and Shankar (2012), Roszkowska (2011), Srikrishan et al. (2014), and Ahmadi et al. (2013) should be integrated with AHP. It is also suggested to conduct further studies that consider the effects of uncertainty like Almaktoom (2017), Almaktoom and Krishnan (2016), Wang et al. (2013, 2014), and Krishnan et al. (2016) on optimal location selection. 2389","department of operations and information management, effat university po box 34689, jeddah 21478, kingdom of saudi arabia mmsamkari@effat.edu.sa, abalmaktoom@effatuniversity.edu.sa","References

76,Challenges Facing Projects Due To A Lack Of Resources  Bervesh Bhika,"one of the major challenges facing many engineering companies today is a lack of sufficient resources to staff all projects concurrently. the objective is to understand the challenges that engineering projects experience due to a lack of resources. all projects require human resources because they play an important role in any project. these resources may contribute to either a projects success or failure. that is why having the correct people for the project is extremely important. the most common and widely experienced challenge on a project is insufficient team skills. organisations should consider leadership’s skills, human management and skills management to ensure a projects success. engineers are required to have technical knowledge and skills, understand standards of engineering practice and have intellectual skills. the findings revealed that a projects success is achievable by complying with the planned budget, time lines and performance criteria","lack of resources, skills shortages, brain drain","Based on the findings of the survey, the lack of skills and brain drain were the two main reasons for the lack of resources in Engineering projects. The lack of skills is predominantly due to professional leaving the industry and in some instances leaving the country. Political instability leads to economic recession causing limited implementation of infrastructure requirements by Government. With the lack of implementing infrastructure, Engineering jobs are scarce and thereby resulting in lower salaries. Therefore, Engineers often take their skills abroad where there is a demand for the Engineering profession. Suitable and correct resources are required for any project to succeed. Unrealistic deadlines and poor planning of resources puts additional pressure on resources, resulting in a failed task or project. A lack of skilled resources is also a challenge because the incorrectly skilled resource tasked on the project may not meet the deadline or the client’s requirements. Another challenge with resourcing is shifting resources around, either to assist others or carry out damage control. In Engineering, a balance is required between experience and expertise. The environment of a project is always dynamic, so success factors might change over time. To ensure the success of a project, compliance with the planned budget, time frame and performance criteria is required. A project is to have competent team members. The project goals and the team roles and responsibility are to the clearly defined.","postgraduate school engineering management and gibb engineering and architecture university of johannesburg, auckland park, johannesburg, gauteng, south africa bervesh@gmail.com jan harm c pretorius postgraduate school engineering management university of johannesburg, auckland park, johannesburg, gauteng, south africa jhcpretorius@uj.ac.za","References

77,Historical Overview Of Maintenance Management  Strategies: Development From Breakdown Maintenance To,"every industrial revolution causes changes in technological, socioeconomic and cultural features. among the technological features belongs also maintenance management. the approach towards equipment maintenance has changed throughout the revolutions from reactive towards predictive. instead of fixing breakdowns, companies try to predict them and minimalize the risks and costs associated with it. the main objective of this article is to put the changes in maintenance management strategies in the context of industrial revolutions. throughout a literature review, the article summarizes the characteristics of each industrial revolution and maintenance management approach together with paradigm shifts that accompanied them. namely the relation of the first industrial revolution with breakdown maintenance, the second industrial revolution with preventive maintenance, the third industrial revolution with preventive maintenance and finally the fourth industrial revolution with predictive maintenance.",industry 4.0,,"predictive maintenance in accordance with four industrial revolutions peter poór, david ženíšek, josef basl department of industrial engineering and management university of west bohemia univerzitní 8, 306 14 pilsen, czech republic poorpeter@gmail.com, zenisekd@kpv.zcu.cz, basljo@kpv.zcu.cz",
78,"Steady State, Transient And Harmonic Behavior Analysis Of  Home Appliances","nowadays, a large percentage of power electronic based home appliances are connected in distribution system. it has become necessary to analyze the behavior of these loads. the steady state, transient and harmonic behavior of home appliances have been analyzed in this paper. in addition, current signature technique has been used to measure the current transient response of home appliances. the current signature technique is already found applications in identification of motor faults. the information achieved from current signatures is beneficial to power utilities, consumers and appliance manufacturers. the power factor of various home appliances was also measured and results are presented in this paper.","home appliance, current signatures, transient state, steady state","In this work, current signatures, current & voltage waveforms, power factor and harmonic spectrum of several home appliances are presented. It is concluded from the transient results that the current signatures are distinctive for different appliances. It is also clear from the results that motor driven home based appliances loads draw a large maximum current during turn on but it gradually comes to normal within few cycles. The non-linear loads like desktop PC and CRT TV set also draw high inrush current during startup. The information achieved from current signatures of home appliances is much prudent to the power companies, supply consumers and appliance manufacturers. Moreover, this information is quite beneficial for the selection of home protective devices. These devices can be fuses, circuit breakers, earth leakage circuit breakers, magnetic contactors, relays etc. In this research work, the harmonics spectrum of various nonlinear loads were analyzed. The harmonic order and power factor of various loads are also compared. It is clear from the experimental results that the loads like laptop have low power factors and highest THD magnitude as compared to other loads. The loads such as CRT TV, desktop computer and energy saver have highest value of 3rd harmonics.

81,Development Of Vendor Management Inventory (Vmi)  Model For Single Vendor Single Retailor Using Imperialist,"this paper develops a single-vendor single-retailer supply chain for multi-product. the proposed model is based on vendor managed inventory (vmi) approach and vendor uses the retailer's data for better decision making. number of orders and available capital are the constraints of the model. in this system, shortages are backordered; therefore, the vendor’s warehouse capacity is another limitation of the problem. after the model formulation, an integer nonlinear programming problem will be provided; hence, a metaheuristic algorithm called imperialist competitive algorithm has been used to solve the model. consequently, order quantities, number of shipments received by a retailer and maximum backorder levels for products have been determined with regard to cost consideration. then, a numerical example is presented to describe the sufficiency of the proposed strategy. furthermore, the model is also solved using particle swarm optimization (pso) and compared with the imperialist competitive algorithm (ica).","back order, warehouse","and recommendation for future work In this paper, an inventory model was developed under conditions multi-product and multi constraint for the vendor managed inventory (VMI) system in a two-echelon supply chain. Moreover, it was assumed that shortages are backordered, so the vendor’s warehouse capacity was limited by an upper bound for available inventory or maximum inventory. Since in inventory models, constraints like number of orders, available capital, and average inventory have an important role, these constraints were added to the model, too. The obtained model was an Integer Nonlinear Programming (INLP) problem; thus, the Imperialist Competitive algorithm (ICA) was proposed to solve it. Furthermore, Particle swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm was also used to compare the results. Finally, a numerical example was presented to describe the sufficiency of the proposed strategy. Supply chain is a very complicated system. It includes many parameters and involvement of many people to run effectively (Krajewski and Ritzman, 2002). The vendor managed inventory model used here presents a simplification considering as one retailor has many products, many distributors and a number of retailers and suppliers. The real-life scenario is much more complex. Since the product considered here is supplied all over the country to a thousand of retailers, it is not possible to collect the data for the research in such extensive level with limitations like sources of information and cooperation. The more the members are included in the model, the more the realistic policy would be found with the help of genetic algorithm. Thus, by including more and more members and information of the supply chain, this limitation can be mitigated For future work extensions, the followings are recommended for other researchers: 1.The lead-time effects can be considered. 2.Alternative meta-heuristic search algorithms such as Tabu search (TS) or simulated annealing (SA) can be used. 3.Other situations like variable costs and discounts can be considered. 4.Non-deterministic parameters such as fuzzy or stochastic demand can be considered. Other cases of VMI system like the single-vendor multi-retailer, multi-vendor single-retailer and multi-vendor multi-retailer systems can be modeled.

82,The Triple-Helix Sub-Revolution And The Hype Of Industry 4.0  Rigard Johan Steenkamp,"society and operations managers are confronted with the hype of the fir (fourth industrial revolution) in many ways. the magnitude of the next industrial revolution is a huge reality but it also needs to be seen for what it really is in terms of its progress, sub-revolutions, social dangers and unique cyber-physical systems (algorithms). the smart telematics, machine-to-machine (m2m) technology and connected devices through computer-based systems are not all new or disruptive. the notion that disruption is by default an inherent fir value may be questioned especially when personal transformation is demanded or thriving in a time of endless innovation. an agile business in the digital age is not the only option for innovation improvement or for commendable transformation journeys. the fir identity therefore needs to be clarified by means of an accepted model. an qualitative exploratory research approach was used to look deeper into the fir movement and to address the research problem by providing perspectives about the hype, identifying triple-helix (th) as a significant sub-revolution of the fir and to make suggestions for further research to clarify its identity.",triple-helix (th),The paper indicates a weak FIR identity that may be improved (clarified in a model) by acknowledging the unnecessary hype and other sub-revolutions.

83,Remaining Life Prediction For Corroded Gas Pipeline  Management In The Era Of Industry 4.0,"in modern industry, metal pipelines are an important means of transporting energy. however, the pipe can corrode with time elapsed. corrosion is one of the major causes of failure in gas pipelines. the purpose of this paper is to present a probabilistic approach to predicting the residual life of gas pipeline with corrosion defects. the proposed method consists of three steps. first, instead of deterministic one, a stochastic model is adopted to deal with the variability in corrosion growth rates. second, the failure probability of the pipeline is obtained by using pcorrc, one of widely used codes to calculate the pipe failure pressure. third, the remaining pipeline life is predicted by using iso 16708, a global standard of limit state method on pipeline reliability. the feature of the presented method is that it accommodates the probabilistic behavior of corrosion growth and deals with the uncertainty of various pipe parameters. this makes it possible to obtain more realistic prediction results. an illustrative example is given by using an inline inspection data. finally, based upon the residual life prediction, a future framework is provided for the pipeline prognostics management required in the era of fourth industrial revolution.","remaining life, pipeline, corrosion defects, stochastic model",,"seong-jun kim department of industrial and management system engineering gangneung-wonju national university wonju, gangwon province, 26403, korea republic sjkim@gwnu.ac.kr woosik kim center for facility technology research gas research institute, korea gas corporation ansan, gyeonggi province, 15328, korean republic wskim@kogas.or.kr",
84,Critical Success Factors For Lean Implementation  “Projection On Smes”,"lean manufacturing has become one of the pillars of modern industry. for that, many manufacturing companies are implementing this japanese approach; whose main objective is to minimize their costs and maximize their profits. among these manufacturing companies, small and medium-sized enterprises (smes), which have the same objectives. however, many companies apply lean manufacturing, without prior studies, which lead in most cases to several problems. it is in this context, the aim of our paper is to study the critical success factors (csfs) during the implementation of lean manufacturing in enterprises, especially in smes. therefore the chance of successful lean implementation is improved and evaluated before its implementation.","implementation, smes","Lean Manufacturing remains a philosophy that is recognized worldwide thanks to the elimination of wastes in processes (for example: too much stock of finished products, too much production waste), in order to increase the production capacity, while reducing costs and production cycle time. That is why many companies implement it, but it is not always a success and can lead to failure if the implementation is not well studied. It is in this context, this paper has reviewed the literature of different articles dealing with the implementation of Lean Manufacturing in several firms from different sectors (food, industry, aerospace, automobile...) and categories (SMEs, Large companies), which allowed us to extract a multitude of critical success factors necessary for the implementation of Lean Manufacturing in any organization, which we summarized later in twenty five CSFs. Subsequently, we calculated the occurrence of each factor identified in the literature and established a Pareto chart in order to obtain the most important CSFs during the implementation of Lean Manufacturing, which were summarized in thirteen CSFs. Those factors were then analyzing in the SMEs environment and classifying them according to three main categories that distinguish SMEs from Large Enterprises (Organization, Resources, and Management).","mariam houti a, laila el abbadi b, abdellah abouabdellah c systems engineering laboratory national school of applied sciences kenitra ibn tofail university kenitra, morocco a mariam.houti@gmail.com b laila.elabbadi@uit.ac.ma c a.abouabdellah2013@gmail.com",
85,Toward An Efficient Residential Electricity Consumption:  An Assessment Of The Effectiveness Of Residential Electricity,"energy subsidies are commonly used by governments for many social and economic objectives. in some rich countries, energy products are supplied to beneficiaries at subsidized prices as a way of wealth-sharing. despite the objectives of energy subsidies, they have critical impacts on the efficiency of energy use. saudi arabia, which previously heavily subsidized fuel and electricity prices, recently reformed its energy subsidies as an incentive by which to increase the efficiency of domestic energy consumption. this paper estimates the impact of the residential electricity subsidy reform in saudi arabia. the price-gap approach is applied in this paper to estimate the cost of electricity subsidies in 2018 if the electricity prices remained unchanged. additionally, the impact of the price gap removal on the elasticity of demand is estimated in order to measure the efficiency of current residential electricity consumption. residential electricity subsidies accounted for 0.8% of saudi arabia’s gdp in 2017, which is equivalent to 5.382 billion usd. it is estimated that the energy subsidy reform will lower the government residential electricity subsidy bill by 52%. in addition, the efficiency of electricity consumption is estimated to increase and, thus, result in a 22,031 gwh decline in electricity demand.",price-gap approach,"and Recommendations Saudi Arabia has recognized the need to increase its energy consumption efficiency and decrease the economic burden of its energy subsidies. To this end, it established an energy subsidy reform program on January 1, 2018. In addition to the economic gains that could occur due to a subsidy reform program, the efficient use of energy results in environmental benefits as it lowers CO2 emissions released by the generation and use of energy. However, many researchers have suggested that monetary interventions related to inefficient energy consumption has a limited long- term impact on consumption behaviors. Therefore, it has been suggested that non-price interventions, such as providing feedback to the consumers about their consumption, can result in a better long-term benefits. Nevertheless, the energy subsidy reform in Saudi Arabia has certainly yielded significant fiscal gains by reducing the subsidy bill, even if the reform program will have a limited long-term impact on increasing the efficiency of energy consumption. -500 1500 3500 5500 7500 9500 11500 13500 15500 1-2000 2001-4000 4001-6000 6001-8000 > 8000 Residential Electicity Consumption Change (GWH) Consumption (KWH) -150 350 850 1350 1850 2350 1-6000 >6000 Millions USD Consumption (KWH) 545","efficiency-incentive subsidies reform in saudi arabia ramzi alahmadi department of industrial engineering taibah university al madinah, saudi arabia rlahmadi@taibahu.edu.sa","References

Therefore, the activities, as mentioned in the previous subtopics, would be divided among the four operators, in addition to following a pattern (flow) between the parts of the sector. In addition, activities in this scenario would be less cluttered because of diminishing resources. Another good option, as demonstrated, would be to change the layout of the productive sector. This would certainly require further study as well as the feasibility of such an investment. Also, the transport times, with the change of layout, would change, and therefore, there should be a new study of the times of these activities to obtain concrete results from the simulation. Therefore, the changes are plausible and can be executed without harming the current scenario. With this, the LC2 Operator could be allocated to some other location of the company, giving space for optimization, expansion and improvement to the company. Therefore, the production system adopted would have four employees, in order to allow expansion to the sector and, therefore, to the company. The work allowed to work with several areas of industrial engineering, from process mapping, to chronoanalysis and simulation, being an integrated project with impressive results, as demonstrated in every development.","jackson generoso, milton alexandre ziehlsdorff and paulo henrique gamba department of production and systems engineering federal university of santa catarina caixa postal 5185, 88040-970, florianopolis, sc, brazil jacksonluge@gmail.com, milton.xande@gmail.com and paulohenriquegamba@gmail.com",
90,Exchange Rate Risk Hedging For A Global Supply Chain Of  Nonstorable Commodity In Presence Of A Spot Market,"exchange rate fluctuation increases the risk of global supply chain management. in this paper, we study a global supply chain of a nonstorable commodity, which involves transactions to be settled at a foreign currency between a manufacturer and a supplier. both parties are risk-averse, and they negotiate a supply contract through a nash bargaining process. to hedge against the exchange rate risk, they can purchase forward exchange rates in the financial market. in addition, the manufacturer can also procure the commodity from a local supplier. this avoids the exchange rate risk, but incurs another risk because the quantity available from the local supplier is not very certain. we formulate the problem as a nash bargaining game where the two players have mean-variance preferences over their profits. we derive the unique equilibrium supply contract under a random exchange rate and a random local supply, from which we can characterize the optimal forward exchange rate level and the local procurement level.",,,"yinping mu1, xiaoqiang cai2, and xiaowo tang3 1,3school of management and economics university of electronic science and technology of china chengdu 610054, china ypmu@uestc.edu.cn, tangxw@uestc.edu.cn 2shenzhen key laboratory of iot intelligent systems and wireless network technology the chinese university of hong kong, shenzhen, and the shenzhen research institute of big data guangdong, china xqcai@cuhk.edu.cn","References:

92,"Multi-Item, Multi-Location Transshipment Model For Cross  Filling","distribution centers (dcs) usually receive orders from the customers (mostly retail stores) located in its area; and deliver goods in the following day. in order to secure fulfilling all orders every day, the dcs will have to maintain a high level of inventory, which will deteriorate the profitability. as an alternative to high level of inventory, cross filling is, after closing the daily order receipt, to ship the surplus items to other dcs that lacks the same item during the night to improve the order fulfillment rate. the economic justification of such cross filling will depend on the trade-off between extra cost of transshipment and saving of shortage cost. in this paper, an lp model is proposed, which determines the optimal quantity of items and number of trucks to transship so as to maximize the profit of cross filling for a day. unlike most existing research on this problem where transshipment cost is proportional to the transshipped quantity, transshipment cost is considered as proportional to the number of trucks used for the transshipment, regardless of the quantity loaded in it, which we believe is more realistic. the proposed lp model also allows the ‘simultaneous chain transshipment’, which enables distant locations to supply surplus to the location that faces shortage.","transshipment, cross filling, order fulfillment","In this paper, we address the transshipment problem for a common configuration comprising single supplier and multiple non-identical DCs, each of which supply goods to the customers (retail stores) located in its geographical region; and each DC orders to the supplier every day using order-up-to policy. A linear programming model is proposed which determines the optimal quantity of items to transship, number of trucks to transship between pairs of DCs so as to maximize the profit of cross filling for a day. Three features that make this paper a unique one are as follows. Firstly, unlike most existing researches on this problem where transshipment cost is assumed proportional to the quantity transshipped, in this paper transshipment cost is considered proportional to the number of trucks used for the transshipment, regardless of the quantity loaded in it, which we believe is more realistic, despite it makes the model more complicated. Secondly, unlike some studies where possible links are limited to a certain number, in this paper, possible links between DCs are limited based on the distance (or, correspondingly, travel time) between them. That is, the optimal transshipment is constrained by the length of time window (T) during which transshipment is carried out. This aspect is practically important, since more distant DCs can be considered for transshipment as T increases by, for example, more efficient order picking in DCs. Thirdly, volume constraint of items to transship is considered, which has not been addressed in the literature. Depending on the size of the items, it is not unusual for the total volume to transship to exceed a volume capacity of a small delivery truck. Furthermore, authors are exploiting the vehicle routing problem where both pickup and delivery over multiple locations is considered for transshipment, in which case volume constraint becomes a critical one. Another fruit from the model is that ‘simultaneous chain transshipment’ is formalized, which has not received appropriate attention in the literature. This simultaneous chain transshipment of items can be of practical tool for the cases where surplus is not available in its vicinity, but surplus from far distant site can reach the needing site by simultaneously moving the same quantity in a supply chain. One may criticize the proposed model in that transshipping multiple truckloads between DCs every day is unrealistic in the real world logistics practice. However, under order-up-to replenishment policy and highly variable demand, transshipping a relatively large amount can reduce more shortage with substantially lower inventory level. Also, in the near future some new transportation tools such as drone may become a common carrier, in which case multiple carriers to transship among multiple DCs or locations can be a practical tool for cross filling. For further research, a solution procedure needs to be developed to find the optimal order-up-to value for our transshipment model. One may extend the problem to the case when transshipment cost is negligible, for example, where there already exist trucks visiting routinely a sequence of locations. One possible research avenue is to implement replenishment policy other than order-up-to policy, such as reorder point policy or periodic order policy, which we believe is more practical since most upstream replenishment from factory to DCs are unlikely to occur every day. For these cases, one may develop a simulation model in which the proposed optimal daily transshipment repeats over a long time so as to evaluate the average performance of the proposed model. Using the simulation model, the value range of the parameters that makes this transshipment economical can be identified; and the impact of the replenishment policy on the average performance of the transshipment can be better understood. Also the simultaneous chain transshipment can be further exploited to identify its characteristics.

93,Investigation Of Project Delay In Construction Projects In  The South African Rail Industry,"the construction industry is one of the largest contributing sectors towards the gross domestic product of countries globally, and south africa is no exception. the construction industry in south africa is marred with persistent and extensive delays. this study investigates the project delay factors in construction projects, particularly the passenger rail agency of south africa and transnet traction substation projects in the south african railway engineering environment. the research also presents the remedial actions and mitigations suitable to be implemented to manage project delays in the project engineering environment. the research was conducted through a literature review and a questionnaire survey and the research approach was deductive. an online questionnaire survey was employed to collect primary data. the literature review revealed eight top project delay-causing factors in traction substation projects, forming the basis of the questionnaire; and the questionnaire results correlated with the literature review. this paper proposes suitable measures to manage delays in construction projects, improving the quality of work and managing cost and schedule overruns.",project delays,"and Recommendations 6.1 Conclusion Delays affect several construction projects in South Africa and globally. History reveals that project delays were always part of construction projects. The difference between the past and the present is the accelerated rate of the project delays. Delays in the construction environment are categorized into excusable delays. These delays are caused by external interferences, such as weather and politics. They are also classified into the category of non-excusable delays. The prescribed processes and procedures were not followed in some phases of the project. Some projects are simple; they may be completed in a brief period and without difficulties. Certain projects are complex and are extended over long intervals. Various authors from the reviewed literature indicated that delays in construction projects have negative implications on the economy of several countries globally; the construction industry is one of the largest contributors to the GDP of several countries. The questionnaire survey respondents agreed and validated the identified project delay factors as indicated in the literature review. The most general project delay-causing factors in traction substation projects were identified; suitable mitigations were recommended in this study. Several researchers established that project delays are not peculiar in the project engineering environment, but that they are common. Delays vary from project to project; it could be hours, days, weeks or even years. That does not necessarily indicate the extent of the financial loss incurred. It is possible that the project that was delayed by a few hours, suffered a severe financial setback, additional to a project suspended for a year. Question Count Score Proactive planning and timeous identification of potential delay risks. 83 4.42 Run independent construction activities in parallel. 83 4.02 Involve construction team in the engineering processes such as designs. 83 3.95 Ensure that the planning and engineering teams has worked on a similar project previously with the one being undertaken. 83 3.9 Understanding of laws, rules and regulations that could hinder the project. 83 4.35 Ensure availability of project funding prior to construction commencement. 83 4.54 Prepare a detailed construction plan. 83 4.55 Appoint experienced and reputable contractors & consultants. 83 4.37 Do not appoint a contractor based on the lowest bid price. 83 4.35 Promote good engineering ethics & accountability 83 4.66 Keep to set milestones and key dates 83 4.42 Average 4.32 609",itumeleng gladwell motlhatlhedi and hannelie nel postgraduate school of engineering management faculty of engineering and the built environment university of johannesburg south africa i.g.motlhatlhedi@gmail.com; hannelien@uj.ac.za,"References

94,Applying Customer Relationship Management Principles In  A Sales-Oriented Engineering Organisation,"increasing levels of competition for customers have challenged organisations to adopt strategies to acquire new customers and to retain existing customers. the strategies to acquire new customers, regain lost customers and retain existing customers form part of customer relationship management. in the past years, the company in this study has lost customers and sales opportunities that also translate into a loss of profit. the current study was undertaken within the context of a company that is part of a global organisation providing engineering products and services and operating as a sales unit in south africa. the main objectives of the study were to assess the current application of customer relationship management in the case study company; and to identify the challenges thereof with the purpose of developing strategies to close the gap. the study employed survey research and questionnaires as the research strategy and a data collection method. the results of the study indicate that the case study company paid more attention to customer focus, organisational culture and organisational compatibility. information technology and department collaboration were identified as the areas which require improvement for the company to realize the benefit of effective customer relationship management and implementation.",customer focus,"After the data collection and analysis was performed, it could be concluded that not all of the factors could be retained as they were with the items used for their measurement. The scales for the factors of organisational compatibility for CRM and organisational culture were indicated to lack reliability and validity. The scale for customer focus could be used with caution as it shows a degree of reliability and validity to some extent. The CRM success factors that were adequately identified in the current study were that of knowledge management, organisational commitment, IT use for CRM, management support and department collaboration. It was established through an analysis of the items means for the various success factors that customer focus was the factor that was mostly practiced in the case study company. This shows that the company does focus its business around customer needs. An organisation that conducts business in a manner that best provides value to its customers is recognized to be market oriented. This indicates that there is an awareness within the case study company of the importance of knowing what the market demands. Organisational commitment towards CRM was indicated to have the highest items mean out of the five factors with a satisfactory Cronbach’s alpha for reliability, indicating an item mean of 3.583. This was followed by management support with an item mean of 3.542. This corresponds to what is highlighted by Garrido-Moreno et al., (2014) that management support is a vital aspect of CRM which is closely linked to the organisational commitment towards CRM. Management with an attitude oriented towards accumulation and sharing of knowledge enables the knowledge management process (Hasanian et al., 2015). Consequently, having a relatively high indication that management support is present for CRM within the case study company makes it conducive for the company to enable knowledge management practices. There is an indication that the case study company has made efforts to be customer focused, internally, however, efforts to enhance collaboration between departments have been comparatively neglected. Improving such collaboration between departments could be enabled by knowledge management practices which, amongst other things, encourages collaborative learning between departments. Having such a low collaboration between departments would hinder the company from effectively gathering market intelligence, as collaboration between departments was considered critical for adopting a market-oriented approach. It was recommended that the case study company should involve all the departments in the implementation of CRM. The future research should identify the impact of industry 4.0 in the implementation of CRM.","linda nhlengetwa, hannelie nel and bheki makhanya post-graduate school of engineering management faculty of engineering and the built environment university of johannesburg johannesburg, south africa 200502538@student.uj.ac.za, hannelien@uj.ac.za, bheki.makhanya@transnet.net",
95,Substantial Utilization Of Mst To Reduce Taxi-Delay  In The Metropolitan City Of Johannesburg,this paper presents a design of solving taxi-delay during peak hours utilizing techniques from graph theory. the minimum spanning tree algorithm (denote mst) is efficient for searching optimal transport routes between locations. the intuition of the mst problem is that it depicts different sort of scenarios where it is crucial to use this theoretical approach and how to use this tool for discovering a solution. graph theory incorporates various algorithms for searching the minimum spanning tree and this paper uses one of them. to model the situation of taxi-delay optimization we use connected weighted graph where vertices represent locations and the edges represent the transport routes between the locations. the weight of an edge represents the time to drive the taxi between two locations. a theoretical discussion and a model example are carried out to assess the mst.,"graph theory, decision tree, ttm",,"mike nkongolo school of computer science and applied mathematics university of the witwatersrand johannesburg, south africa mike.nkongolo@damelin.co.za laby ilumbe department of transport and supply chain university of johannesburg johannesburg, south africa labyi@uj.ac.za; labyilumbe@gmail.com","References

98,Model-Based Engineering Of A Process Wash Plant Using  Sysml: Case Study Of Beneficiation Processes In A,"the fourth industrial revolution is being fostered in many countries to make more efficient and flexible plants. industry 4.0 target is to get a more competitive industry. under this framework, improvement of mineral processing requires knowledge of previous methods and current technology in order to develop new techniques and approaches. as phosphate deposition decreases, the need for new recovery methods keeps growing. from this perspective, the need for control and optimization of existing processes becomes a necessity. it also includes the development of equipment with more advanced digitized components. the objective of our work is to develop a model of a process plant using sysml. in this paper, we adopted a system engineering-based approach, which consists on modeling and formalizing knowledge collected in the field. a well understanding of phosphate value chain allows both driving and optimizing current processes. in addition, we used this approach to model information flows in which we integrated a specific equipment in the overall process. this model will follow a systems engineering approach. in this paper we present the development of the sysml model of a process plant (wash plant of phosphate). the model includes the requirements as well as the structure, behaviour and activity 642",,"Model-Based Engineering is necessary for the engineering of the industry 4.0 systems. In this paper we have developed a SysML model of a process Wash Plant of phosphates. This model can be used for the design of the plant and for all the engineering activities through the plant life cycle. Our adopted approach summarizes various modeling tools working with a well-known industrial partner in Phosphate valorization. Using these approaches, we will guarantee efficient beneficiation processes by optimizing their operating parameters. Simulation through Excel allows the analysis of properties and performance of each equipment. In future works, we will investigate the possibility to generate Excel simulation from any SysML model by defining a map from SysML to Excel elements.","phosphate industry mariem ait bakader applied organic chemistry laboratory faculty of sciences and technics, sidi mohamed ben abdellah university, fes fes, morocco complex systems engineering laboratory mohammed vi polytechnic university, benguerir benguerir, morocco mariem.aitbakader@usmba.ac.ma mariem.aitbakader@um6p.ma laurent deshayes complex systems engineering mohammed vi polytechnic university, benguerir benguerir, morocco laurent.deshayes@um6p.ma mohammed el asri applied organic chemistry laboratory faculty of sciences and technics, sidi mohamed ben abdellah university, fes, morocco fes, morocco mohammedelasri@yahoo.fr",

100,A Framework To Prolong Interval Of Turnaround  Maintenance (Tam) Of Processing Plants: Pressure Drums,"tam is the largest maintenance activities for any a processing plant run continuously under harsh operating conditions. tam event is usually a costly in term of time and cost due to plant downtime to execute their activities. the present study aimed at presenting a framework to prolong interval of tam. the proposed framework in this study included three stages: applying risk-based inspection (rbi) to select the most critical drums that constituted the highest risk on the plant performance, applying failure distributions (fds) of the most critical drums and comparing an estimated risk (er) with a tolerable risk (tr) to determine an optimum interval of tam. this framework is characterized with the application of methods and techniques to reduce cost of tam and production losses, and to improve all aspects associated with in reliability and availability of a plant to eliminate potential failures and prolong equipment life. the results of application of the framework proven its ability in the increase of interval of tam of the processing plant without any threat to operational performance of plants. the improvement of tam interval also revealed further in the reduction of tam costs and production losses and the consequent income of millions of dollars.",,"The purpose of the work was to present a framework to prolong the interval between TAMs of processing plants that operate continuously under harsh conditions. This framework is divided into three stages; RBI of heat exchangers, failure distributions, comparison of ER with TR to identify the most critical drums at processing industries. Results showed that two of thirty two pieces of drums were identified to determine the optimum interval of TAMs at 73500 hrs every cycle TAMs based on production losses, damage of company assets and environmental issues resulting from corrosion effect in the pressure drums. An increase of interval between TAMs contributes in an improvement of reliability and availability of a processing plant. The proposed framework in this work can be implemented to any processing plant operated continuously under harsh conditions, however, proper attention must be identified according to the most critical pieces of equipment which cannot be inspected or maintained during the normal operation of a processing plant. 1823",case study abdelnaser elwerfalli college of mechanical engineering technology benghazi - libya gq7qg@yahoo.com,"References

103,Advantages And Requirements For A Successful Introduction  Of An Industrial Tele Maintenance System,"in the projects maintelrob and bayerndigital, it was clearly shown that there is an huge need for tele maintenance systems in the industrial context. while most systems focus on remote access on machines, in many cases it is way more important that remote experts and local technicians can communicate and work in a tight collaboration to get tasks like commissioning, repair and optimization done. not only for a better situation awareness, but also for security it is also important to have multiple cameras to get different perspectives simultaneously. this needs to work not only within a site, but also worldwide in case of medium to big enterprises. in such cases it is crucial that the tele maintenance system is flexible and efficient at a wide range of available bandwidth and line characteristics. also security needs to be an integral part of such systems. the zentrum für telematik has invented and demonstrated such a system. but there are also many requirements which need to be fulfilled for a successful introduction of such systems. in major enterprises only approved devices are allowed to be used, especially on the job floor to minimize security risks. in many cases, the network infrastructure, firewalls and access control systems aren’t designed for such usages. this holds for local wlan coverage (which, if rolled out, is primarily used for time uncritical systems with low traffic demands), for access to internal machine networks (even if the connections do exist physically), the firewall between office and job floor (in most cases it is either not possible to connect from the office floor to the job floor, there is no firewall and hence a high risk, or the firewall is very static), the site network (e.g. not sufficient performance on the plant’s backbone) and the connection between the sites. additionally, many internal processes like escalation plans and documentation need to be adapted. ways of getting the cost-value ratio for different usage scenarios of such systems are very important for many deciders. this is also true for additional changes like the introduction of call centers. also there need to exist clear arrangements of responsibilities between the remote and the local individuals. one big obstacle are often the privacy laws – theoretically such systems do enable both video supervision and an accurate rating of single employees. this paper gives an insight about these challenges and provides approaches to cope with them. the zentrum für telematik has gained much experience during introducing and evaluating its system in several little and major companies.","tele maintenance, security, processes, introduction",,"michael fritscher, christian lilge, markus krauß and prof. dr. klaus schilling zentrum für telematik magdalene-schoch str. 5, 97074 würzburg, germany name.surname@telematik-zentrum.de",

Hence, the findings of this research contribute by helping the Somaliland Telecommunication industry in the development of employees’ psychological state. As personal resources have direct effects on job performance of employees and are indirectly affected through job commitment, the findings of the present study offer information regarding factors affecting job performance and affective commitment of employees.

107,Developing A Discrete Event Simulation Methodology To  Support A Six Sigma Approach For Manufacturing,"competition in the manufacturing industry is growing at an accelerated rate due to globalization trend. this global competition urges manufacturing organizations to review and improve their processes in order to enhance and maintain their competitive advantage. one of those initiatives is the implementation of the six sigma methodology to analyze and reduce variation hence improving the processes of manufacturing organizations. this paper presents a discrete event simulation methodology to support a six sigma approach for manufacturing organizations. several approaches to implement six sigma focus on improving time management and reducing cycle time. however, these efforts may fail in their effective and practical implementation to achieve the desired results. following the proposed methodology, a discrete event simulation model was built to assist decision makers in understanding the behavior of the current manufacturing process. this approach helps to systematically define, measure and analyze the current state process to test different scenarios to improve performance. the paper proposes a systematic process improvement approach which allows for constant refinement of a process until a state of perfection is achieved. it applies an action research strategy to develop and validate the proposed modelling methodology in a british manufacturing organization competing in global markets.",six sigma,"and Future work This paper presents a Discrete Event Simulation methodology to support a Six Sigma approach for manufacturing organizations. The methodology includes the analysis and construction of a Discrete Event Simulation model to support decision makers, planners and managers in understanding the behavior of the current state of the manufacturing process under study. This will help them to be better informed to support their decisions in improving the manufacturing process. The DES model is constructed integrating the DMAIC improvement cycle, the Six Sigma technique to analyze and reduce variation, and the application of a Discreet Event Simulation approach. The paper proposes a systematic process improvement approach which allows for constant refinement of a process until a state of perfection is achieved. The paper applies action research to validate the proposed methodology in a British manufacturing organization competing in global markets. Thus, the analysis, development and validation of a Discrete Event model of an assembly line of a British manufacturing organization in the automotive sector is described in the paper. The constructed model of the assembly line highlighted the need to improve the current state process due to high waiting time and queue time within the existing process. This proposed systematic methodology could be implemented in manufacturing organizations to support the analysis and improvement of process performance and the successful implementation of their Six Sigma initiatives. The methodology can be improved further in the near future by addressing the following issues:  Further action research is needed to analyze and implement the methodology in other assembly lines and collecting data considering a longer period of time.  Combine the DES methodology with other modelling techniques (e.g. System Dynamics) to analyze the effect of strategic factors (internal and external) on manufacturing processes.  Validate the DES methodology with data collected from other assembly lines.  Create a detailed action plan for the implementation of improvements. 683","organization – case study anees hussain, jose eduardo munive-hernandez, felician campean faculty of engineering & informatics university of bradford bradford, bd7 1dp, uk a.hussain286@bradford.ac.uk, j.e.munive@bradford.ac.uk, f.campean@bradford.ac.uk","References

108,Analysis Of Factors Undermining The Reliability Of  Permanent Way Infrastructure In The South African,"various factors have been highlighted as causes of reliability deficiency of permanent way (perway) infrastructure, globally. it however was not known as to which of these factors are prevalent in the south african railway industry. the study develops a framework for identifying and classifying causes of reliability deficiency of perway. the research followed the exploratory sequential mixed methods; the researcher conducted a qualitative research in a form of structured interviews and used the results thereof to build a quantitative research survey. a quantitative questionnaire survey was used to solicit responses from 52 respondents, comprising mainly of engineers, project managers, and technicians who possess vast experience in the management of railway infrastructure. findings reveal that poor maintenance policies, strategies and implementations is the most pervasive factor causing reliability deficiency of railway track in south africa whilst insufficient funding and aging rail network became the second and third factors, respectively. the research also concluded that; track components used in south africa are as good as those used by other major railway organizations globally. the study recommended that; south african railway organizations should priorities the replacement of old infrastructure and as part of continuous improvements, realign and modernize their maintenance strategies and implementations.",permanent way,"and Recommendations Railway transportation remains a very key economic enabler for South Africa. It is of paramount importance to ensure that the reliability of the railway infrastructure remains intact and is continuously improved, to enhance railway competitiveness. This study provided a focused view of factors that are of major impact to the reliability of railway track; this will allow railway organizations to narrow their focus and channel efforts into resolving factors that will yield optimum results. 6.1 Conclusions Following the Pareto analysis, it can be concluded that; poor design of components and systems, Manufacturing defects and inherent flaws, Organizational rigidity and complexity, application of Excess loads, Lack of Critical skills, human errors and miss management of wheel/rail interaction are not major factors undermining the reliability of railway Track in South Africa. It can therefore be deduced that:  Railway Track components used in South Africa are as good as those used in the so called developed countries  Overloading of trains is well managed and is of minimal impact to the reliability of railway track  The railway organizations in the country are well managed, by properly skilled and qualified professionals  Even though railway is losing skilled people through retirement and other reasons, the railway organizations in the country seems to be compensating for such through various training and skills development programs It can also be concluded that, the deterioration of track reliability in South Africa is largely attributed to aging rail network, Insufficient funding as well as Poor maintenance policies, strategies and implementations. 6.2 Recommendations Following the research findings, the following recommendations can be made;  The railway organizations in the country should priorities the replacement of old infrastructure through capital expenditure.  Adequate funding should be made available for railway construction, maintenance and rehabilitation projects  As part of continuous improvements, railway organizations should realign/refocus and modernize their maintenance strategies and implementations 6.3 Future work In line with the objective of this study, the thesis only compares the influence of various factors undermining the reliability of railway track, it does not go as further as finding solutions to quell or eradicate those factors. Future work is required to deal with the root causes of these factors as well as to find solutions to eradicate these factors for the reliability of railway track. Due to the small sample used to conduct this study, further research is highly recommended to provide a much broader view. 7.","railway industry m mukwena, a wessels and j h c pretorius postgraduate school of engineering management, faculty of engineering and the built environment, university of johannesburg gauteng, south africa m.mulalo@outlook.com, jhcpretorius@uj.ac.za",
109,Logistics Performance And National Culture,: this paper investigates the relationship between national culture and logistics performance of different countries. we use the logistics performance index (lpi) data to capture the logistics performance of different countries as well as the hofstede national culture framework to capture the different culture dimensions’ data of the same countries. we tested the statistical relation and significance between the different culture dimension and lpi and proposed various hypothesis that describe how the logistical performance of countries is related and affected by these dimensions. the managerial impact of our findings suggests that logistics strategists need to consider deeper knowledge of the regional national culture when assessing investments locations. also acknowledging some required behavioral and structural adjustment efforts in some locations to improve logistical performance is another outcome of this knowledge. these managerial impacts also include global supplier selection and assessment decisions. the rising importance of logistics contribution in today’s supply chain management needs to be further contextualized with local national culture,"logistics, national culture",,"deepak p. kesavan industrial and manufacturing engineering dept., college of engineering, california polytechnic state university, san luis obispo ca 93407, usa dkesavan@calpoly.edu ahmed m. deif industrial technology and packaging, orfalea college of business, california polytechnic state university, san luis obispo ca 93407, usa corresponding author: adeif@calpoly.edu",
110,Wind Energy: A Case Study On Wind Power As An Alternative  Source Of Renewable Energy,"the aim of the research study is to investigate wind power as a source of renewable energy and to uncover the beneficial contribution and impact wind power has as an alternative source of energy and how it can be improved and managed for the benefit of the current and future generation. there are various natural resources in which energy can be generated from these include the power from natural sunlight, the wind and the constantly flowing waters of oceans and river throughout the world. out of the world’s current population the demand for energy constantly increases and due to the high demand. the demand for energy is also incurred by countries that have rapid growing economies such as china and india. these countries find it impossible to quench the demand and therefore require external assistance and alternative sources of energy. the services required by these countries include for example air conditioning services. these demands are fundamental and yet too high for the country such as india to provide utilizing its own resources and therefore india relies on coal for more than half its energy generation and to fuels for its factories and transportation. this country in a producer of coal and has 565 coal mines making it the world’s third largest producer of coal but it still cannot maintain its economic growth without new energy sources. wind energy is one of the most useful and helpful renewable energy solutions. it is a form of solar power and has proven to be successful for decades since it began being used. wind energy provides mechanical power in order to turn electrical generators by using air flow that goes through wind turbines. the blades of a wind turbine can be up to 40 meters long and can spin around more than 20 times in a minute. key words wind power, solar energy, renewable energy sources. © ieom society international 2252",,,"e i edoun and charles mbohwa; thobile yvonne bhila faculty of engineering and the built environment university of johannesburg, south africa kingsway rd and, university rd, auckland park, johannesburg, 2092 edounsen@hotmail.com, cmbohwa@uj.ac.za; bdc.thobile@gmail.com",
111,The Storage And Management Of Natural Resources: A Case  Study On Water And Energy Usage And Management In Hotels,"the aim of the research study is to analyze with in depth scrutiny the concept of waste in the hospitality industry with particular interest in water and energy, which are natural resources. the study targets to unravel the causes of waste especially of water and energy in the hotels and ways in which it may be decreased for the benefit of the current and coming generation. hotels are responsible for a significant amount of energy and water consumption on a daily basis not only in the building construction but also due to its establishments where they have installed complicated installations that provide the guest with good quality and high levels of multi- facetted comfort and high class amenities, treatment and facilities. many services offered by hotels are resources incentive. these resources needed to provide most of the services hotels offer include water, energy and or raw materials and these are utilized in excessive amounts. the guests nowadays are extremely complicated and have high expectations on the hotel they lodged with, these expectations include the actual facility, the services the staff of the hotel offer, the food they provide and the overall experience of the guest in the hotel. these expectations causes significant pressure on the hotel management on what they provide in the hotel and how they continue to remain competitive in the market for their guests. this has a great influence on the escalation of the wastage levels in hotels especially in natural resources such as water and energy. guests for example required ample amounts hot water to be available in the hotels 24 hours a day 7 days a week, they also expect the air condition to be working at a good temperature all day every day, guests also expect their food to be prepared by master chefs in front of them while they wait and in their specific preference and all these cause very high levels of wastage to be experienced on a daily basis. hotels are to work out ways to implement day-to day methods that will supply the guests with service that is good enough and yet also ensuring that wastage at all departments is kept on the bear minimum, especially the natural resources (water and energy) key words natural resources, waste management, conservation, solar power, wind power, hydropower and wave power, geothermal power, biomass and water audits 2253",,,"in gauteng e i edoun and charles mbohwa; thibile yvonne bhila faculty of engineering and the built environment university of johannesburg, south africa kingsway rd and, university rd, auckland park, johannesburg, 2092 edounsen@hotmail.com, cmbohwa@uj.ac.za; bdc.thobile@gmail.com",
112,Lean And Green Manufacturing Practices: A Multiple Case  Study About Synergy,"this article aims to evaluate the synergy between lean and green manufacturing practices in the brazilian furniture manufacturing industry. the life cycle assessment (lca) and cleaner production (cp) practices were considered for the evaluation of the green manufacturing practices. thus, the synergy evaluation was determined by the adherence level of lean manufacturing (lm), lca and cp and by their correlations (pearson coefficient). the research method used was the multiple case studies with 10 brazilian furniture-manufacturing industries, through interviews and observations in the production units. the main results showed that the brazilian furniture manufacturing industry has a low level of adherence for lm, lca and cp practices. the level of compliance for lm was 28.33%; for lca it was 21.43%, and for cp it was 19.05%. however, the analysis of correlations allowed identifying a strong dependence between lm and cp practices (pearson coefficient of 0.8849) and the moderate dependence 698",,"The study of multi-cases in the Brazilian furniture industry showed a low level of adherence of LM (28.33%), LCA (21.43%) and CP (19.05%). The lack of LM, LCA and CP practices is related to the low number of furniture factories that are ISO 9000 and / or ISO 14000 certified. Only 40% (4) of the furniture factories study to present some type of ISO certification. The analysis of the Pearson correlation coefficient between LM, LCA and CP practices allowed identifying a strong correlation (0.88) between LM and CP practices and a moderate correlation (0.58) between LM and LCA practices. A strong positive relationship means that the LM application eliminates LM and GM waste at one go, thus creating the conditions necessary for CP and LCA to be achieved, improving the company's environmental performance. It reinforces that LM, LCA and CP practices can be integrated. The correlation analysis also showed that ISO 9000 and 14000 certifications positively influence the level of adherence of LM, LCA and CP practices. Finally, the method of evaluation of synergy used in the multi-case study allowed to clearly identify a group of 9 practices that present Lean and Green synergies: LM01 (Lean Manufacturing Philosophy), LM10 (Just-in-time- JIT: Setup), LM15 (Autonomation- Problems Solving), LCA06 (Reuse - Packing), LCA08 (Reuse - Water consumption), LCA10 (Logistics - Suppliers environmental impacts), LCA14 (Responsibility - Environmental responsibility), CP03 (Raw Material- Change in raw material) e CP04 (Raw Material- Recycling of raw material).","paulo r. avancini graduate program in production engineering methodist university of piracicaba (unimep) santa bárbara d’oeste, sp, brazil paravancini@ifes.edu.br jairo j. assumpção graduate program in production engineering federal university of santa catarina (ufsc) florianopolis, sc, brazil jairo.jose@unisociesc.com.br andré l. helleno graduate program in production engineering methodist university of piracicaba (unimep) santa bárbara d’oeste, sp, brazil andre.helleno@unimep.br engineering school mackenzie presbyterian university (mackenzie) são paulo, sp, brazil andre.helleno@mackenzie.br lucila m. s. campos graduate program in production engineering federal university of santa catarina (ufsc) florianopolis, sc, brazil lucila.campos@ufsc.br",

114,Impact Of Proactive Orientation And Innovation On Exports.  Case Colombia.,"this research paper presents the relationship between the proactive orientation towards the market and the novelty degree of innovation in the internationalization of companies, measured with the export intensity. the data to test the hypothesis of the research were obtained from a sample of colombian manufacturers from the second survey of development and technological innovation, conducted by the national administrative department of statistics (dane by its abbreviation in spanish) in colombia. the survey seeks to establish the dynamics of technological development of the colombian manufacturing company in terms of the intensity and trajectory of the innovation and technological development activities. from the total number of companies consulted, there were 297 in different sectors that responded to the survey and provided their information to be used in the study. the data were treated by means of a model of ordered logistic regression, whose result was the conclusion that there is a positive relationship between the proactive orientation towards the market and the export intensity, while it was not possible to demonstrate the relationship between novelty in innovation and the same export intensity.",export intensity,"The main motivation of this research was to empirically prove, by means of the application of an ordered logistic model to 297 companies, that what is found in the literature on the support that the proactive orientation towards the market offers to the companies in order to have an efficient internationalization through exporting growth, is applied in all cases. In the same way, to confirm if an even greater effect was obtained together with the degree of novelty of innovation. The evidences found in the study allow to conclude that indeed there is a relationship between the proactive orientation towards the market, and that there is no relation with the degree of novelty of the innovation. In order to continue with the studies on the internationalization of companies, taking into account the proactive orientation towards the market as one of the main determinants, it is important to carry out the empirical analysis in homogeneous companies, that is to say that they must have similar characteristics in terms of size, age, type of innovation, among other factors, preferably in specific sectors of the industry. On the other hand, subsequent studies may inquire about other institutional conditions that contribute to the development of the capacities of an organization to create the conditions that favor exporting, in such a way that, in a synergistic manner, companies can undertake effective strategies that allow them to be included in international markets. 7. Limitations One of the limitations of the study was the impossibility of having data from homogeneous companies in terms of size, the geographical location where they are located, and the type of innovation. In most of the studies where we want to make inferences about the behavior of companies, organizations are reclassified into micro, small, medium, and large companies, with the aim of reaching explanations or predictions, depending on the case, not only for the specific sample but of the population, facilitating the execution of the same exercises in other regions, countries, or industries. It is important to know the type of innovation since it is not the same to make a technological innovation, necessary to make innovation in products or processes, or an innovation of the non-technological type, such as organizational or administrative changes within a company.

116,Customer Churn Prediction Using Artificial Neural  Network: An Analytical Crm Application,"customer need is the most important factor in the formation of each market and business. it engages companies in order to meet their need by developing new products and services. although it can make an appropriate attraction for company customers, a company needs to have a good understanding of their customer dynamic behavior. based on this understanding, they can provide appropriate planning for customer’s retention. in banks, customers are key components of the banking business. all of their strategies and plans are organized to attract new customers, retain current customers, and ultimately enhance customer satisfaction. meanwhile, customer churn is one of the most important problems for this business. it deprives a bank of various earnings and fee incomes. and more importantly, customer deposit is the main source of the incomes earned by a bank in the islamic banking system. it may lead to the withdrawal part of a bank’s deposits. by considering the loss of these two sources of incomes, along with the possibility of increasing the reputational risk, can lead a bank to the brink of bankruptcy. the present study provides a model of customer churn prediction for retail customers of a commercial bank in iran. by applying advanced data analysis techniques on transaction and operation data of the bank customers, appropriate classification of customers is presented in terms of the churn rate. thus, by executing suitable strategies for each category, it can be developed to reduce the amount of customer churn. in this research, a private bank in iran has been used to predict the customer's bank data. the results show that the jobs associated with food services including restaurants and fast food retailers, as well as the technical services, have the highest churn rate in the bank. after them, the sports centers, as well as the household, are in the next ranks of churn from the bank services. in contrast to counseling centers, kindergartens, and governmental organizations, respectively, were the lowest risky corporate customers of the bank. also, in retail customers, clients aged 30-40 years had the largest churn in the bank’s services.","customer churn, prediction, classification, customer retention",,"seyed hossein iranmanesh, mahdi hamid, mahdi bastan, hamed shakouri g., mohammad mahdi nasiri school of industrial engineering, college of engineering university of tehran tehran, iran hiranmanesh@ut.ac.ir, m.hamid31400@ut.ac.ir bastan@ut.ac.ir, hshakouri@ut.ac.ir, mmnasiri@ut.ac.ir","References

120,Making The Profitability Paradox Of Bad Banks: A System  Dynamics Approach,"in traditional business models of banking in developing economies, banks earn profit by attracting deposits and offering loans, facilities, and mortgages to customers. this approach has been for many years a predominant business model, while their key performance indicators (kpi) show lack of business profitability. this issue is a diversion from the primary purpose of profitability initially built in the business model, and is called the profitability paradox. in this research, the data of financial statements of a private bank in iran between 2012 and 2016 was used to define and represent the profitability paradox problem. to find causes of this problem and provide effective solutions, a system dynamics methodology has been applied. a holistic system model of the problem is represented to depict the causal structure of behavior of the profitability paradox. the results show that a suitable strategy for profitability, would be a shift from the interest income-based structure to the service-based structure.","system dynamics, interest income",,"mahdi bastan a,b, sareh akbarpour a, alimohammad ahmadvand a, hamed shakouri g. b a department of industrial engineering, university of eyvanekey, garmsar, iran b school of industrial engineering, college of engineering, university of tehran, tehran, iran bastan@ut.ac.ir, akbarpour@eyc.ac.ir am.ahmadband@eyc.ac.ir, hshakouri@ut.ac.ir","References

125,An Approach Of Designing Robust Plant Layout Using  Genetic Algorithm,"in today’s competitive global environment, industries manufacture different types of products to fulfill market demands. this results into a number of diversified processes to be performed in industries. these processes are performed on different machines to produce a final product. so, a need arises for proper arrangement of machines in the workplace. for this, plant layout is an effective tool for allocating different machines to a different location. the main objective of plant layout is to provide smooth workflow throughout the facility. in this paper, a new model of the process type of plant layout is provided with an aim of minimizing the total material flow cost by reducing the unnecessary movement between the machines. the genetic algorithm is suggested to compute allocations of machines and estimation of cost incurred in the layout. finally, a numerical illustration is discussed for reducing the material flow cost to prove the efficacy of the proposed model.","process layout, genetic algorithm, reduce costs. so","In this work, a method for process type plant layout is proposed with the aim of reducing total material handling cost. Since material handling cost is one of the major contributors in increasing the cost of production. A robust layout procedure is developed for dynamic environment, where different demand scenarios are considered. Robust layout is fixed for different planning periods. This is being clearly shown in numerical illustration. Genetic algorithm (GA) solver is employed in MATLAB for optimizing the proposed process type plant layout. Further, result shows that the proposed method is able to reduce material handling cost significantly. This proposed method can further be applied to similar situations in industries with some or little modification. This work can be further extended by considering numerous decisive factors for the cost and constraints of floor area for similar types of small or large scale industries.","rahul sakharwade, udit narayan sahu, mridul singh rajput department of mechanical engineering, national institute of technology, raipur, chhattisgarh, india rahul.sakharwade279@gmail.com, sahuudit09@gmail.com, msrajput.me@nitrr.ac.in",
126,Analysis And Optimization Of Wire Electric Discharge  Cutting Parameters For Micro-Hardness Of Ni55.8Ti Shape,"recently, there has been an increased usage of niti shape memory alloys in biomedical and other industrial applications due to their special properties such as shape memory effect, superelasticity, and high strength to density characteristics etc. but, due to their poor machinability, the advanced processes are being explored for their successful machining i.e. better machinability. this paper reports a part of research conducted on the machining of ni55.8ti by wire electric discharge cutting (wedc). in the taguchi l16 orthogonal array based experimental study, four important wedc parameters namely gap voltage, pulse on-time, off-time and wire feed rate have been varied and their effects are analyzed on micro-hardness (which is an important machinability indicator) of the shape memory alloy specimen. anova and taguchi based optimization of wedc parameters has also been done to secure the best value of the micro-hardness.","biomedical, micro-hardness, shape memory alloy, taguchi","In the present work, Ni55.8Ti alloy is machined by WEDC at different process parameter combinations and various machinability indicators including micro-hardness have been investigated. Following conclusions can be drawn from the work reported in this paper- 1. Low levels of gap-voltage and on-time and high level of off-time favour the micro-hardness and makes it equivalent to the hardness of base material. 2. On-time has the maximum contribution on the microhardness followed by gap voltage and off-time. Wire feed rate is a non-significant parameter as compared to other input parameters. 3. The optimal setting of process parameter is voltage: 20V; pulse-on time: 0.35µs and pulse-off time: 24µs for the best value i.e. 316.23 Hv of micro-hardness of Ni55.8Ti alloy. 4. WEDC process has the potential to machine difficult-to-machine materials such as Ni55.8Ti, and can be explored further to investigate the other machinability indicators and other materials. 779","memory alloys neeraj sharma and kapil gupta department of mechanical and industrial engineering technology university of johannesburg 2006, republic of south africa nsharma@uj.ac.za, kgupta@uj.ac.za","References

Moreover, increased space utilization has been achieved through proper placements. Efficiency to save time when searching for any tool or other item has shown significant improvement after implementing Seiri, Seiton, Seiso and Seiketsu (4S). Before implementation, it took approximately more than 4 minutes to search and find a tool and just higher to 7 minutes 40 seconds until a tool is found. It was quite challenging to gather data before implementing 5S, because everything was unorganized. Before 5S was implemented it usually took 218.5 minutes (Total Time) which equals the efficiency of 76.48% in a random week, these results are detrimental to the efficiency of saving time. After 5S implementation, a gradual decrease to 80.78 minutes on Total Time Observed, which equals the efficiency of 28.30% as, this is an achievement and objective attained. That is the difference of 137.72 minutes saved in a week. After Total Time Observed is achieved, Time Saving Efficiency has been achieved as anticipated from a disappointing 76.48% before to a 28.30% after implementation. That is a satisfying decrease of 48.18%.

131,Industrial Iot Integrated With Simulation – A Digital Twin  Approach To Support Real-Time Decision Making,"the industry faces more and more the challenge of deploying and taking advantage of evidence-based strategic decisions to enhance profit gain. in this research, the possibility of having a fully integrated system composed by a simulator and an iot platform with the capability of collecting real-time data from the shop floor and returning performance indicators to support decision making is evaluated. the suggested approach involves a manufacturing executing system (mes) producing a production schedule, an iot platform composed by a message broker and a real-time database, a simulator including simulation software and a wrapper, and a user application serving as an interface between the user and the iot platform and simulator integrated system. a detailed analysis of the functionalities and integration of the simulator and the iot platform will also be explored. to evaluate the approach, one use case of a production line in the automotive industry is used. the application of the integrated iot simulation system permits its validation and consequent future work.",,"This research presents an integrated system composed by Industrial IoT and Simulation to support decision making in the industry sector. The advantage of this approach is to have a fully integrated system capable of connecting two worlds, the physical and the virtual one. Besides that, it also allows the automatic insertion of real-time data on simulation models using an IoT platform. This means that the simulation models can be fed more quickly without wasting human resources on data exchanges. The implementation to the use case was considered fundamental to check the followed approach applicability. It was chosen specific software, Simio to model the production line and Kafka and MongoDB to represent the IoT platform. To accomplish the full integration two wrappers were also defined. The success of the technical approach implementation permits its validation and enforces the usability of this kind of approach as the future of the industry companies in order to support their decisions. As future work, a deep analysis, containing comparison of a real use case in its “as is” state and with the proposed approach integrated, is considered fundamental to explore the gains in terms of key performance indicators of its manufacturing processes. 826","romão santos and joão basto centre for enterprise systems engineering inesc tec porto, portugal romao.f.santos@inesctec.pt, joao.p.basto@inesctec.pt symone g. s. alcalá faculty of sciences and technology federal university of goiás aparecida de goiânia, goiás, brazil symone@ufg.br enzo frazzon industrial and systems engineering department federal university of santa catarina florianópolis, brazil enzo.frazzon@ufsc.br américo azevedo department of industrial engineering and management faculty of engineering of the university of porto porto, portugal ala@fe.up.pt","References

134,Integrating Production Assessment With Ppap – A Qfd  Approach,"all organizational activities, especially production activities, have to be consolidated in new premises for a supply chain of particular products to be competitive in a globalization market. production part approval process (ppap) is a second-party approval process, as well as a part of the consolidating mechanism, conducted by a manufacturing company on its suppliers to ensure quality of parts from these suppliers. on the other hand, production assessment such as total productivity management (tpm) is a third-party approval process, also a part of the consolidating mechanism, to endorse the production and process capacity of the suppliers. to avoid repetitive resource investment of the suppliers on these approval processes, this study proposes a three-phase approach called ppap-qfd in an attempt to integrate requirements from both ppap and production assessment, and then outline necessary improvement methods to meet these requirements via quality function deployment (qfd). a real-world case study utilizing ppap-qfd is presented to demonstrate how this approach can continuously improve production capacity and ensure product quality.",,"and Recommendations All organizational activities, especially production activities, have to be consolidated in new premises for a supply chain of particular products to be competitive in a globalization market. Both PPAP and Production Assessment are part of the consolidating mechanism. However, repetitive resource investment on these approval processes would hinder the progress of the supplier toward global competitiveness. This study proposes a three-phase approach called PPAP-QFD in an attempt to integrate requirements from both PPAP and Production Assessment, and then outline necessary improvement methods to meet the eighteen requirements of PPAP via QFD. A real-world case study utilizing PPAP-QFD is presented to demonstrate how a company can apply this approach to continuously improve production capacity and guarantee product quality delivered by the supplier. It is recommended that a simplified version of this PPAP-QFD approach and a software program, such as the approach adopted by Moubachir and Bouami (2015), can be developed in the future for its more successful implementation.","chi-shuan liu department of industrial engineering and management chaoyang university of technology taichung, 41349, taiwan scsliu@cyut.edu.tw horng-chyi horng department of industrial engineering and management chaoyang university of technology taichung, 41349, taiwan hchorng@cyut.edu.tw",
135,Plagiarism In Colombian Universities – Regulatory Aspects,"plagiarism has been a phenomenon on which various investigations have been carried out, some of them general and others more specific, trying to measure its existence in specific areas of knowledge. although plagiarism is legally a crime, the analysis of this phenomenon must go beyond the position from the law, and necessarily transcend to the academic field. in this sense, the role of universities is of vital importance because it is in their bosom where the greatest opportunities for students not to respect copyright take place, either because they do not know the scope of this action or because it is the easiest and fastest way to fulfill the academic commitments of their training process. this research seeks, through an exploratory analysis, to establish the position of universities in colombia, both from the regulatory aspect and from the implications that plagiarism has in the process of training professionals in this country. for this purpose, the official databases of the ministry of national education and the contents published by the institutions in their web pages were used, which, in most cases, are public access.","plagiarism, academic fraud, student regulation","The results of this research show that plagiarism has a different treatment depending on the conditions of higher education institutions. There are significant differences according to the level of training they provide, the fact of having or not institutional accreditation of high quality, the public or private sector to which they belong to, and the seniority of the institution. As an important conclusion, it was found that in a high percentage, institutions have not defined the seriousness of plagiarism as a misconduct or the sanction that it entails. Thus, this vagueness leads to a high level of subjectivity in the assessment of the level of the misconduct and in the punishment to be imposed, with the aggravating circumstance 850","omar alonso patiño c. faculty of administration, finance and economic sciences universidad ean bogotá – colombia opatino@universidadean.edu.co gerardo avendaño prieto faculty of administration, finance and economic sciences universidad ean bogotá – colombia gavendanop@universidadean.edu.co laura marcela patiño gutiérrez faculty of administrative sciences fundación universitaria cafam bogotá – colombia laura.patino@unicafam.edu.co","References

136,Adoption Of Product-Service System And The Potential As A  Sustainable Solution: A Literature View In The Fashion,"fashion industry is highly dependent on natural resources, being of high environmental concern since those materials are consumed in high frequency and disposability to produce, distribute and to maintain its products. the adoption of product-service systems (pss) can provide to industry a mechanism to increase factors such as product quality and longevity, while providing alternative consumption models that reduce environmental impact. in this context, the purpose of this paper is to identify the existing models of pss in the literature applied on fashion industry, its characteristics, and sustainable potential. content analysis of 24 articles was performed, which are discussed according to the feasibility of operation and its environmental impact. there were identified 11 types of pss applied in fashion industry and 7 types of green practices were observed in the models examined.","fashion industry, pss","The studies that deal with PSS in the fashion industry concentrate their analysis on issues related to the viability of the business in the segment (difficulties and opportunities) such as: operationalization, consumer behaviour, and production methods applicable to the fashion industry. In this context, this work identified and characterized the existing business models of PSS in the fashion industry, as well as its sustainable potential, from the green practices perspective. In this research, 11 PSS practices were found in the fashion industry, such as: manufacturing monitoring, laundry, repair and redesign, take-back, participatory customization, make it yourself, consulting, fashion result, clothing rental, clothing swamp, and second-hand retail. The most discussed PSS in the literature was the rent of clothes. Although indirectly discussed, the take-back model was also present, being considered the supplier of raw material for other types of PSS such as rent, second-hand retail, and repair and redesign. In addition, the literature indicates a trend towards implementation of PSS that do not imply greater financial risks for companies such as repair and take-back. Regarding sustainable potential, studies have shown that PSS models have emerged with a view to sustainability and aimed at reducing the residual effect of business impact. The most widespread green practices in the literature were life cycle analysis and 5R (especially material recycling). Besides, internal environmental management, eco-design, and disassembly of equipment were not quote at any of those publications. The product dematerialization, consumer education and the life cycle assessment were arguments used to justify the practical effectiveness of the models in relation to economic and environmental benefits. Finally, the characteristics of current models still encompass more reactive practices, such as recycling and remanufacturing, than activities that actually promote the reduction in the use and disposal of garments, although there were companies whom already concerned with the circularity of the materials inside of the productive model. For this reason, the possibility of new work confronting the theoretical analysis with a practical case are relevante and using scenario models to verify the viability and evolution of the types of PSS implemented.","industry pedro seolin dos santos1 pedroseolin@gmail.com lucila m. s. campos1 lucila.campos@ufsc.br paulo augusto cauchick miguel1 paulo.cauchick@ufsc.br 1department of production engineering and systems federal university of santa catarina - ufsc florianopolis – sc, brazil",

The first step consisted of assigning the surgical operation to the operating rooms. The second step consisted of sequencing operations, which were assigned to an operating room in the previous step. Given the assigning step have been presented the mixed model programming. The multi-objective functions were to minimize the makespan, idle & over time and to maximize the priority. The second-step considered three Heuristic sequencing rules, which were applied to the discrete event simulation model. The simulation model compared the total waiting time of the three heuristics.

We used BWM to determine the importance of criteria and the PROMRTHEE-II method for ranking options. This new method decreases the disadvantages of using these methods, including reducing the weight of criteria in comparison with other methods of calculations. The advantages of using this method are the implicit rating of options and the graphical viewing of criteria and alternatives on the GAIA page that makes it easily for decision makers to understand the model. Also, we have shown in this method that by changing the weight of the criteria, the degree of importance of the alternatives varies easily, and it is possible to analyze the sensitivity of the model in this method. We applied this model to the biomass selection problem that was selected as the best biomass in early decision making of rapeseed (colza), but by changing the importance of cotton criteria, it was chosen as the best biomass. In addition, the proposed model can easily be used in other real-world. Given that deterministic numbers are used to show the performance of alternatives in the criteria, it is to suggest that fuzzy numbers be used to improve the method to obtain the evaluation matrix.","mahdi bastan school of industrial engineering, college of engineering university of tehran tehran, iran bastan@ut.ac.ir peyman kiani nahand school of industrial engineering, college of engineering university of tehran tehran, iran kiani.n.peyman@ut.ac.ir samaneh korlou and mahdi hamid school of industrial engineering, college of engineering university of tehran tehran, iran s.korlou@ut.ac.ir, m.hamid31400@ut.ac.ir",

144,Challenges In Managing Oil And Gas Supply Chain – An  Exploratory Study,"the current value of the oil price per barrel has severely impacted the oil and gas industry around the world. apart from oil price fluctuation, there are multiple external factors that affect this industry such as oil resources availability, high transportation cost, as well as exposure to high uncertainties. in dealing with these external factors, it is crucial for the oil and gas practitioner to shift their focus into managing resources and capabilities. this can be conducted through performance management. as this industry relies mostly on the supply chain to deliver their services and products, it is important to understand the challenges faced by the oil and gas practitioners in managing their supply chain. therefore, this study will explore the challenges in managing supply chain performance in the oil and gas industry. exploratory interviews were conducted with five supply chain experts in the industry. this study has identified five main challenges in managing supply chain performance.",,,"masha menhat*, jagan jeevan and izyan munirah mohd zaideen school of maritime business and management university of malaysia terengganu 21030 kuala terengganu terengganu, malaysia mashanur@umt.edu.my , jagan@umt.edu.my , izyan@umt.edu.my yahaya yusuf lancashire business school university of central lancashire, preston, lancashire pr1 2he yyusuf@uclan.ac.uk",
145,"Optimal Policy For A Vendor-Buyer Inventory System With  Price-Dependent Demand, Production Cost Discount And","the article considers of a single-vendor single-buyer joint pricing and lot size model in which the vendor’s production process is imperfect. the market demand is a function of the buyer’s selling price. the vendor’s unit production cost is assumed to be a function of lot size of each shipment to the buyer. this paper simultaneously determines shipment size, unit selling price of the buyer, vendor’s set-up cost, reliability of the production process and total number of shipments per lot from the vendor to the buyer. the expected annual total profit function is derived and signomial geometric programming technique is used to find the optimal solutions for different preferences of objective functions. the solution procedure is illustrated by a numerical example.","supply chain, optimal pricing, lot sizing, reliability","and Future Research Directions In this paper, we consider a supply chain model with a single-vendor and a single-buyer where the market demand depends on selling price of the product. All items produced by the vendor may not be perfect. The buyer screens all the products collected by him/her from the vendor. We optimize the profit of the supply chain with respect to the number of shipments, shipment size, buyer’s selling price, the vendor’s setup cost and the discount cost of the defective products. We apply signomial Geometrical Programming technique to optimize the profit. We analyze the impacts of sales revenue, different costs and profits of the vendor, the buyer and the whole supply chain on the price elasticity to demand, lot size elasticity to unit production cost, unit screening cost, scaling constant for demand, scaling constant for unit production cost and reliability of the product. From the numerical study, we observe that lot size dependent unit production cost is more sensitive than constant unit production cost. If lot size increases then unit production cost decreases, and hence profit of the vendor increases. In real situations, it is impossible to produce all perfect items. The profits of the vendor, the buyer and the whole supply chain increase if the vendor produce more reliable items. Also, we investigate that it is necessary for the vendor to produce items not more than certain percentage (in our numerical example, 14%) of defective items. 2425","reliability consideration: a geometric programming approach bibhas c. giri and biswarup samanta department of mathematics jadavpur university, kolkata 700032, india bcgiri.jumath@gmail.com, biswarupsamanta@gmail.com","References

147,Optimal Design Of Additive Manufacturing Supply Chains,"additive manufacturing (am) is one of the most trending production technologies, with a growing number of companies looking forward to implementing it in their processes. producing through am not only means that there are no supplier lead times needed to account for, but also enables production closer to the end customer, reducing then the delivery time. this is especially true for companies with a wide range of low and variable demand products. this paper proposes a mixed integer linear programming (milp) model for the optimal design of supply chains facing the introduction of am processes. in the addressed problem, the 3d printers allocation to distribution centers (dc), that will make or customize parts, and the suppliers- dc-customers connections for each product need to be defined. the model aims at minimizing the supply chain costs, exploring the trade-offs between safety stock and stockout costs, and between buying and 3d printing a part. the main relevant characteristics of this model are the introduction of stock service levels as decision variables and the use of a linearization of the cumulative distribution function to account for demand uncertainty. a real-world problem from a maintenance provider is solved, showing the applicability of the model.",,"and Future Work This paper presented a novel mathematical model for the optimization of SCND integrated with inventory management, in an AM context. The model was used to address specific problems on the elevator maintenance business, but it can be adapted to supply chains on other areas that use AM. The proposed model was able to find optimal solutions for the problems addressed in an acceptable time interval. Nevertheless, the problem size grows exponentially with the increase of the number of distribution centers (remote stations), which makes the optimization problem difficult to solve to optimality. The usage of the set of possible supply chain configurations is one the main causes for the high number of constraints. This set is needed in order to make the model able to consider the correct values for the standard deviation of the demand in each remote station, which are used to determine the safety stock level. Although in a first phase, the supply chain dimension is the one presented in the experimental results, and the proposed model delivers an effective solution, with the growth of AM supply chain an effort has to be made in future work to assure a solution method capable of handling larger problems, with more parts and more remote stations. In this sense, two main research branches will be explored following this work. On the one hand, creating a version of the model for a supply chain in a “make-to-order” logic. In this kind of supply chain, safety stocks are not kept, which will eliminate the need for usage of the set of possible supply chain configurations in the model’s constraints and able it to be used on larger supply chains. On the other hand, solution methods able to tackle the original problem described in the paper on larger instances must be researched, may they be simpler mathematical models or approximate solution methods, such as heuristics and/or metaheuristics.

148,The Effect Of Implementing International Public Sector  Accounting Standards On The Financial Reporting And,"united nations agencies had exerted significant efforts, costs and time in converting their accounting system from unsas to ipsas compliant. this research aims to conduct a thorough analysis of the ipsas implementation impact on the financial reporting and internal control system in the un agencies significant cost and time exerted to complete such conversion and implementation is a key issue to the executive management of the united nations agencies, their governing bodies, and their member states. the research provided an independent evaluation of the implementation process and results achieved in each agency. likert scale survey was used in this study to measure the benefits derived by ipsas according to the respondent's point of view. the analysis of the responses of the participants showed that ipsas implementation improved the financial reporting of the un agencies and brought them in line with globally recognized standards and made their financial statements understandable by all stakeholders and comparable among each other. in addition, the implementation of ipsas led to a better internal control system for the un agencies.","ipsas, internal control","This study examined the benefits and challenges of adopting the IPSAS in the United Nation agencies. The study examined the benefits of adopting the system. From the findings of the study, it was observed that the adoption of IPSAS increased the level of accountability and transparency in the United Nation agencies. It was found that the adoption of IPSAS enhanced comparability. Also, it was indicated that adoption of IPSAS based standards will enable the provision of more meaningful information for decision makers and improve the quality of financial reporting and internal control system in the United Nation agencies. All UN agencies had declared the successful implementation of IPSAS and converted their accounting standards from UNSAS to IPSAS. However, there is a deep internal discussion in the United Nations agencies and the donor community of the real impact of the IPSAS implementation and if the sought target had been achieved. the research aimed to conduct a thorough analysis of the impact of IPSAS implementation on the financial reporting and internal control system in the United Nations agencies. The research provided an independent evaluation of the implementation process and results achieved in each concerned agency. The research also provided an overall view of the first-ever UN-wide project, however, implemented individually by each United Nations agency separately using its own financial resources. A survey was used to collect information from a sample United Nation employee, the analysis of the responses of the participants showed that IPSAS implementation had improved the financial reporting of the UN agencies and brought them in line with globally recognized standards and made their financial statement understandable by all stakeholders and comparable among each other. In addition, the implementation of IPSAS had led to a better internal control system for the United Nations agencies. In fact, strengthening the internal control system covers all aspects of the internal control system. The main benefits derived from the implementation of the International Public Sector Accounting Standards include enhanced transparency, improved consistency and comparability of financial information, enhanced decision making, reduced and better management of expenditure as well as improved asset and liabilities management. On the other hand, the survey respondents believed that there are many challenges facing IPSAS implementation that should be taken into consideration, the costs and risks associated with the implementation and adoption of IPSAS should not be underrated, there are some challenges facing the implementation of IPSAS such as the cost of introduction and Implementation of IPSAS, availability of qualified accountants, obvious complexities, incompetent accounting systems and resistance to change. Hence, we conclude that the adoption of IPSAS in the United Nation agencies improved the financial reporting and internal control system. 910","internal control systems in united nations agencies ahmad ababneh* and pasqualina porretta** department of management sapienza – university of rome via del castro laurenziano 9, rome 00161, italy *ahmad.ababneh@uniroma1.it ,** pasqualina.porretta@uniroma1.it aiman hija finance department food and agriculture organization of the united nations rome, italy aiman.hija@fao.org","References

149,Design Of Glass Reinforced Concrete Wall For Improved  Utilisation Of Natural Light And Aesthetics Without,"the main purpose of this research was to use sunlight as a light source in order to reduce the power consumption of illumination inside buildings while enhancing aesthetics. translucent concrete is a concrete based material with light-transmissive properties, obtained by embedding light optical elements like optical fibres in it and glass liquor bottles. light is then conducted through the stone from one end to the other. light transmitting concrete, also known as translucent concrete and is made by switching the ingredients of traditional concrete with transparent ones or embedding fibre optics. in this paper optical fibres were used to transmit light through fibre. this smart translucent concrete can be used as a green energy saving construction material. it is a promising technology for field applications in civil engineering.","reinforced concrete, concrete strength","and Recommendations 5.1 Conclusions The glass reinforced concrete block minimum flexural strength was defined through calculations and literature review of existing designs. Light transmittance in optic fibres was found to be greater than the transmittance through the glass liquor bottles by comparing light passing through a sample with glass or optic fibre to a sample without the glass or glass fibre. Finite element analysis proved that adding 2-3% of optic fibre without affecting the strength of concrete and maintaining the concrete strength within the standard M₂₀ concrete grade. The same percentage of optic fibre in combination with glass a liquor bottle (cylindrical mould) improves light penetration through concrete walls. Also, the light passing through the glass was found to be dimmer than the light passing through the optic fibres. The only setback with using glass fibre to reinforce concrete is its cost but that is arguably outweighed by the improved aesthetics it gives to walls as well as the ability to save energy using sunlight, a renewable resource for lighting. 5.2 Recommendations However, improvements can be made to the light transmitting concrete to archive better results in line with objectives. Melting the glass liquor bottles and molding them into glass rods will improve both compressive strength and light transmittance of concrete. To obtain transparency in concrete walls the optic fibre can be arranged in a mesh. 6.","compromising the strength takudzwa kureya mechanical engineering department university of zimbabwe box mp 167, mt pleasant harare, zimbabwe tkdzwkureya@gmail.com loice gudukeya, charles mbohwa faculty of engineering and the built environment, university of johannesburg, auckland park 2006, p.o box 524, johannesburg, south africa loicekmg@gmail.com cmbohwa@uj.ac.za",

151,Two-Stage Meta-Heuristic Algorithm For Parallel Machine  Scheduling With Additional Resource Input In Shipyard,"development of an efficient workspace scheduling algorithm for shipyard manufacturing has become more crucial as the modern smart factory technologies burgeon. because the shipyard manufacturing is greatly sizable, a decision making on workspace scheduling is not a trivial mission. in particular, there are several considerations to schedule the block processing on the workspaces such as due date or resource limitation in the workspaces. in a practical sense for workspace scheduling, it is commonly used strategy to input additional resources into a workspace to shorten the total production time because a little curtailment of the total production time can provide a huge revenue in shipyard manufacturing. in this study, we tackle the workspace scheduling in shipyard manufacturing considering the additional resource input strategy. this problem can be considered as a class of the parallel machine scheduling problem. we introduce a mixed integer programming model for the addressed problem, and develop an efficient meta-heuristic algorithm. the proposed algorithm is composed of two stages: (i) a genetic algorithm enhanced by an ordering-based heuristic scheduling and (ii) a tabu-search algorithm for local search with considering additional resources input. the comprehensive computational study shows the efficiency of our proposed algorithm.","genetic algorithm, tabu search",,"manufacturing soonkyo lee, yoonho seo, taesu cheong school of industrial management engineering, korea university, seoul, south korea myeva@korea.ac.kr, yoonhoseo@korea.ac.kr, tcheong@korea.ac.kr seokhyun chung industrial & operations engineering university of michigan, ann arbor, mi, usa seokhc@umich.edu",
152,Performance Assessment Of Buck Converter Using Single  And Cascade Control Loops,"switch mode power supplies play a vital role in the applications of computers, telecommunications and mobile chargers due to their fast-dynamic response and less power consumption. these power supplies require sophisticated and powerful solid state devices to withstand greater variations of input line voltage and load. the performance analysis of buck converter against these changes is presented in this research work. these changes are controlled with single and cascaded control schemes. initially, the buck converter is implemented with a single output voltage loop and then a cascade control scheme. both control schemes are designed with proportional, integral and derivative (pid) controllers. the cascade control scheme consists of two loops that are current and voltage loops. the buck converter is decomposed into two first-order systems and its dynamics are controlled with a cascade control scheme. these control schemes are developed and simulated in simulink toolbox of matlab software. the simulated results of the buck converter with a single loop are compared to the cascaded loop. the analysis shows that with the addition of an inner current loop in cascade control scheme, the inductor current of buck converter is reduced.","buck converter, single loop, cascade loop","In this research work, the performance of the buck converter is simulated with single voltage loop and cascade control loop schemes. Simulation results confirm that the inductor current of buck converter has been reduced five times due to addition of inner current loop in cascade controller. Moreover, it is also clear from results of cascade control scheme that this reduced overshoot comes to normal current with larger settling time compared to single loop. The oscillations in output voltage of buck converter with cascaded controller is increased during line and load variations.

The result of the study hopefully forecasts to understand the marketing challenges. Authors have done the prioritization of the marketing challenges by which a businessperson, a researcher, a practitioner may get benefited. Table 2 shows the value of the prominence and relation. Figure 1 shows the interrelationship among different marketing challenges. It is easy to locate, which challenge is more important and which is not for a company. The figure will also helpful for the decision maker to take the decision regarding the challenges. It eases to find out the most prior challenge which affects the market most. In this research, authors have found that state interventionism is the most effective challenge in marketing and low educational standards as the least effective challenge. To overcome state interventionism, a company need to adopt knowledge management strategy as a tool.The study also shows that a businessperson has to manage and fight against state interventionism challenge.","animesh agrawal department of mechanical engineering, nit, raipur, c.g. india animeshgrw@gmail.com suraj kumar mukti department of mechanical engineering, nit, raipur, c.g. india skmukti.mech@nitrr.ac.in",

162,"Investigating The Motivators, Barriers And Enablers  Associated With The Implementation Of Sustainable Supply","sustainable supply chain management (sscm) can play a significant role in improving company sustainability performance by addressing the social, environmental and economic issues in the supply chain, including suppliers, in- house operations, distributors and customers. achieving sustainability through sscm is a challenge that requires understanding the complexity of developing efficient and effective sscm. limited empirical research has investigated that complexity in detail, especially in developing countries. the purpose of this study is to identify and discuss, in the context of certain saudi manufacturing industries, the relevance of key motives, barriers and enabling factors, and their influence on the adoption of sscm practices. also, this study leads to the development of a roadmap for maintaining the key enabling factors and mitigating the main barriers to successful implementation of sscm. this research follows a case-study design, with in-depth analysis of six large companies working in different saudi manufacturing sectors, as well as an expert focus group. data-collection methods included in-depth interviews with top-level managers and documents obtained from company websites. in total, primary data was collected from ten managers and eight experts, and data from 224 secondary sources were analysed. a thematic-analysis approach was adopted to examine the data, and a template was developed to explore the overall view of the sscm implementation process and show the differences and similarities among saudi manufacturing companies and the focus group, with respect to the key motives, enablers and barriers. the results reveal that large manufacturing companies acknowledge the importance of adopting sustainability in the supply chain to improve company sustainability performance. two related motivators drive that adoption, namely, achieving benefits and responding to stakeholder pressures such as regulation, competition and corporate social responsibility (i.e. taking responsibility toward others, such as local community and employees). this study finds that external stakeholder barriers inhibit the development of sscm more than internal barriers. those external barriers include governments, suppliers, customers, and investors and cause negative economic, environmental and social impacts on company development of sscm practices. perhaps the most significant finding to emerge from the analysis is that stakeholder engagement plays critical roles in mitigating those barriers and advancing the adoption of sscm. this study found that corporate understanding of engaging, developing and managing the positive contributions of external stakeholders and, more importantly, of internal stakeholders, is an essential enabling factor in the development of sscm. other significant enabling factors include the availability of technology, performance measurement, a sustainability culture and sustainability strategy. the study template can help saudi manufacturers to follow guidelines that effectively enhance sscm implementation.","enablers, barriers, motivators",,"chain in saudi manufacturing industry abdulaziz aljoghaiman, mohammed saad, vikas kumar bristol business school, business and management department university of the west of england bristol, bs16 1qy, uk abdulaziz3.aljoghaiman@live.uwe.ac.uk mohammed.saad@uwe.ac.uk vikas.kumar@uwe.ac.uk",

(2013) made use of a survey in an exploratory design to investigate the link between sustainable supply chain policies and performance. the study found out that environmental cooperation, eco-design and reverse logistics have a positive impact on performance. the concept of eco-design emphasises on the utility of considering negative impacts on the environment during manufacturing process such as energy consumption, carbon emissions, and water proof print among others. figure 1 below indicates that each step of the business process follows ethical guidance from the nature of the raw materials to the end customer through manufacturing of eco-friendly products as highlighted by clarion (2019). 1781",,"In conclusion the study has revealed mixed results, some green practices impact on performance while others do not, eco- design for example has no impact on performance. However other practices like environmental cooperation have relative impact on operational performance but no impact on social performance. Reverse logistics positively impacts on social performance while green purchasing impacts on both economic and operational performance. The study however could not separate between organisations who adopted GSCM earlier and those who adopted it at a later stage because it was of a much-limited scope. It might be imperative for future studies to carry out research on how GSCM practices impact on performance over time. 6. Recommendations Based on the above conclusions, the following recommendations are therefore made: • For organisations to fully benefit from GSCM the leadership must be fully committed to the practices and fully back it financially. • It might be worthwhile to have a fully-fledged department within an organisation with a full complement of staff assigned to take charge of environmental issues in their organisation. • There is need to put in place proper implementation and GSCM monitoring mechanisms • Organisations should also strive to ensure that green supply chain management rules are strictly followed.","johannesburg based corporates amina mumba, emmanuel innocents edoun and genevieve bakam fotso department of quality and operations management university of johannesburg johannesburg, south africa amumba@tfm.cmoc.com, edounsen@hotmail.com genischou@gmail.com",
164,Ecosystem Factors Contributing To Innovation: A Case Of  Latvian Technological Startup,"an innovative environment boosts technological innovativeness through the implementation of new technologies. at the same time, an innovative environment draws from technological innovation knowledge, which stimulates its development. the most innovative economies exemplify the strong link between economy and science. the leading role of start-ups in eu economy is determined by a range of advantages originating from dynamic process of formation thereof, namely producing large number of new ideas, innovative projects diversification, creation of new jobs. innovation takes place within an ecosystem of multiple factors. any factor missing from the innovation ecosystem hinders new ideas from being generated or evolving into viable commercial products. at the same time, it should be noted that a key indicator of eu innovation leaders is the effective commercialization of their technological innovations. the purpose of this paper is to analyse a set of factors and conditions conducive to the successful development of innovative entrepreneurship environment and technology start-ups in latvia. results of researches show that the main drivers behind a successful innovation ecosystem are favourable administrative requirements, government incentives, available financial resources, academic-industry collaborations, research and development, commercialization, market dynamics, entrepreneurial culture.",innovation,"Based on the statistical analysis authors defined most important factors of the entrepreneurship innovation ecosystem that influence the development of the deep tech startups in Latvia. The survey of the CEOs of 20 high- tech startups defined factors such as entrepreneurial finance, government policies support and relevance; R&D transfer; cultural and social norms as more important for deep tech startups. It is clear that most innovative economies exemplify the strong link between economy and science. A key indicator of EU innovation leaders is also the effective commercialization of their technology innovations. It is important to understand how the environment influences the quality of entrepreneurship. Ideally, the mix of entrepreneurs in a society should include individuals who are growth-oriented, innovative, globally competitive, and/or operating in advanced sectors. The relationship between the environment and entrepreneurship is complex, and one that will yield promising research opportunities for years to come. The impact of an innovation startup ecosystem is manifold. A strong innovation ecosystem allows local economies to retain top talent in their countries. International Corporations call a successful startup ecosystem a good investment. This leads to the creation of more jobs and services and boosts local economy.","inese ratanova faculty of business, management and economics university of latvia, lv-1586, raiņa blvd. 19, latvia inese.r-bki@inbox.lv inesa voroncuka faculty of business, management and economics university of latvia, lv-1586, raiņa blvd. 19, latvia inesa.voroncuka@lu.lv",

At the same time it is a great strategy used to conserve the ecotourism heritage in Colombia, given the use of the resources which serve to create awareness for the conservation of the eco-tourist environment and to diminish the negative impacts that the visitors of each one of them can leave. the eco tourist places. In Colombia ecotourism is not developed as such because companies are more interested in generating profit and emerge, and do not focus on helping the communities and areas where they are located, therefore the concept of ecotourism, it should be taken into account that there is an interest in ecotourism due to the positive factors that this brings, since it generates a source of resources for conservation, special care of biodiversity, cultural heritage and socioeconomic development. Companies play an important role because through them the concept of ecotourism and its components is promoted and disseminated, applying them properly is a healthy habit because it generates a favorable social culture, at the same time it contributes to sustainability and economic development that a community can have with ecotourism activities. Lack of economic benefits to the local community, most of the rewards remain in the tour operators and little is extended to the preservation of the place, the community and the population. Recommendations • Taking advantage of the fact that ecotourism is growing globally in a greater proportion than traditional tourism, the State must propose a strategic economic development initiative for the country based on ecotourism and must appoint the government institutions that ensure to control this activity in the country. . • Promote the development of ecotourism in certain regions of the country where parks and natural reserves already exist for the generation of new direct jobs in nearby communities. • Strengthen transport, communications and sanitation infrastructure in all regions of the country, especially in the most remote areas where the vast majority of natural reserves are located, such as the new road concessions of the ANI on 4G roads with the environmental component implemented. • Promote community projects based on values such as solidarity and joint work to implement ecotourism programs mainly in regions where indigenous and peasant communities live together. 2434","ecological marketing. buenaventura case william e. mosquera-laverde faculty of administrative and economic sciences universidad cooperativa de colombia bogotá d.c., colombia williame.mosquera@campusucc.edu.co oscar a. vásquez-bernal school of basic sciences; technology and engineering universidad nacional abierta y a distancia - unad bogotá d.c., colombia oscar.vasquez@unad.edu.co claudia p. gomez-e. faculty of administrative and economic sciences universidad cooperativa de colombia bogotá d.c., colombia claudiap.gomeze@campusucc.edu.co","References

The process of granting the decision to implement SAP system and all the events that took place during the project were discussed. Participation and support of management and users helped the SAP implementation project. The support of the ERP consulter, which provides installation, support and training services, also had a major effect on project success. With a single integrated ERP system, management started to run the institution more effectively and efficiently. The processes were revised and improved during the project. Effective reports were started to be prepared. User friendly screens were designed. The training program was an important issue that must be settled on the business processes of the enterprises. Training for all modules were organized. Training was necessary for effective use of the system and employees were trained throughout the installation process. Some of the personnel accustomed to using old systems were resisted the new system having new interface and function. They resisted to participate in trainings. During the testing stage, the requests from the units and the redirection of key users were very important. At this stage, staff change became more frequent, and key users were constantly changing. It caused some important points to be missed during the test and analysis stage. Management should take the ERP implementing decision after a detailed study. ERP projects extends frequently arranged time and spending plan. Some fail to deliver many of the promised benefits. Companies can overcome it by understanding the reasons behind. A significant number of the issues are not about technology but rather progressively about the project management issues. These projects need a serious change management as the organizations change the way of doing business.

Of which, those based on probability estimation techniques are the most developed to date. It is important to emphasize that, thanks to the existence of ROS, many of these techniques have been able to translate into algorithms computations that are distributed in the form of open source license packages. Between the SLAM packages of ROS the 'gmapping' and 'hector_slam' stand out. • To determine the hardware and software requirements of the mobile robotic platform, some criteria were established, of which the robustness, scalability and price were the most imposing. As a base structure, an educational platform was used for its expansion capacity and the inclusion of dc motors; As a computer on board, the well-known Raspberry Pi in its version 3 model B was chosen for its ROS support and its wireless communication capabilities; and as a main sensor element, a Lidar sensor for its ROS support and its 360 ° scan capability. • In the assembly of the mobile robotic platform, the main challenge was the provision of hardware components, so it was necessary to make adaptations of the commercial platform, mainly adding support for the Lidar sensor and for the onboard computer. • Finally, to evaluate the operation of the mobile robotic platform, a test protocol was established, which consisted of individual test of components and an integral test, in which ROS SLAM packages were executed in different controlled environments with good results. 5.","jeanette del pilar ureña-aguirre, javier chiza lópez, mayra maya nicolalde, andrés cruz herrera carrera de ingeniería industrial facutad de ingeniería en ciencias aplicadas universidad técnica del norte ibarra, ecuador jdurena@utn.edu.ec, fjchiza@utn.edu.ec, mamaya@utn.edu.ec, arcruz@utn.edu.ec edisson iván aldás serrano departamento de mantenimiento electromecánico del poliducto tres bocas-pascuales-cuenca empresa pública de hidrocarburos del ecuador, ep petroecuador edisson.aldas@eppetroecuador.ec",
174,A Simulation Approach For Spare Parts Supply Chain  Management,"to be competitive, companies must constantly innovate, and having efficient and well-managed supply chains is undoubtedly an important success factor. in the case of spare parts manufacturing, supply chain management is a very complex and arduous task. quite often, spare parts have to be produced for products that have been on the market for very long, with the need to keep a large and varied stocks to ensure supply service level. with an increasing investment in the development and applications, the additive manufacturing (am) technology can yield significant benefits to spare parts manufacturing. am allows the production of parts with a high level of customization, without the need for setups, and helps to decrease costs, inventory levels and lead time. this new reality creates numerous challenges, forcing the design reformulation of traditional supply chains, and leading to an allocation of the production of certain types of parts downstream. this paper proposes a simulation model to address the use of the 3d printing technology on the supply chain of an elevator maintenance service provider. the simulation model allows the assessment of new supply chain designs, measuring their performance, thus avoiding the need of experimenting new solutions in the real system.","supply chain, simulation","The main objective of this work was to develop a simulation model capable of measuring the impact of using the additive manufacturing technology (3D printing) in a supply chain. After defining the main features and requirements of the system, classes representing the supply chain entities were created to model their logic and behaviour. Then, a simulation model of the company’s supply chain was built. A series of dashboards was produced to visualize the KPIs and cost breakdown of the system, and to support the analysis of the results generated by the model. The developed model allows the end user to test the installation of additive manufacturing cells (with different production capacities) in any of the internal facilities of the simulated supply chain, and measures the impact of these changes with KPIs and cost breakdown dashboards when the model runs. Since the classes represent different entities of the supply chain, they provide the model with some flexibility to add or remove entities. With this feature, the model is able not only to test the impact of additive manufacturing, but also the impact of removing or adding a new internal facility or external supplier, and/or products to the supply chain. In the work described in this paper, the simulation model was applied for a specific case study, but the model is more general, encompassing other characteristics that can be very interesting in practice. The model was tested and validated using an illustrative instance of a supply chain that was designed specifically for that purpose. Nevertheless, this model can be applied not only to other supply chains that want to evaluate the use of additive manufacturing in their chains, but also to supply chains of other industrial sectors that want to try some changes in their processes, without compromising the real systems. The model developed in this work could also become a powerful to support the supply chain managers in decision making processes and in getting insights about the cost breakdown and KPIs of their company’s supply chains.

176,Professional Drivers’ Motivations For Eco-Driving Behavior  Jenny Díaz Ramírez,"the deterioration of the natural environment is one of the most demanding challenges in the twenty-first century and governmental authorities and scientific community seems to agree that emissions caused by transport are one of the major causes for the current climate change and pollution problems around the globe. to attenuate these detrimental effects, eco-driving has been proposed as a measure to reduce fuel consumption and pollution and to increase road safety and the welfare of drivers. eco-driving is known as a series of driving practices that are being promoted because of its positive cost-benefit balance, although its short-term effects have also been proven. this study aims to add to the knowledge gap regarding our understanding of eco-driving by analyzing the motivations drivers have for a more eco-driving behavior. a survey was applied to professional drivers from a bus company operating in the northern mexico, with a fleet of more than 700 buses, 260 routes, and 2,000 daily departures. questionnaire includes five sections: knowledge on eco-driving, intention of adoption and motivations for driving eco-friendly; and social norms, barriers and incentives in the adoption of eco-driving company initiatives. this work shows the results obtained and how they can help guide the company to develop the corporate reinforcement –both positive and negative– strategies for its drivers.","eco-driving, bus drivers, motivations, reinforcement, mexico",,"engineering and technologies department university of monterrey nuevo león, mexico jenny.diaz@udem.edu lorena de la paz carrete egade business school tecnologico de monterrrey toluca, mex, 50110, mexico lcarrete@tec.mx josé ignacio huertas energy and climate change research group school of engineering and science tecnologico de monterrrey monterrey, n.l., 68849, mexico jhuertas@tec.mx",
177,Important Conditions For Integrating A Logistics Cluster  Teresa Verduzco-Garza,"the interest in the cluster approach as a strategy for achieving regional competitiveness has become relevant nowadays. organizations in common industries with similar operations are creating synergies to get access for services and customers that are more sophisticated. agglomeration among companies of logistics service activities is a phenomenon becoming more evident in the current regional economies. to reduce logistics costs, increase regional prosperity and create integrated strategies for a specific geographical region to compete in a changing environment is imminent. the purpose of this research is to identify the influence of agglomeration and the readiness to create synergies in some of logistics activities such as transportation services. since the northeastern region in mexico is very active on international trade operations, and a critical mass of transportation services is intensive, the region is the focus of this study. the data gathered was from transportation firms’ executives and secondary data sources. the first part of the study is a comparison of the evolution in different regions where these groups of firms have been stablished and their impact in competitiveness according to the occupied personnel, wages and total investment. on the second part of the research, the data analysis technique applied as part of the methodology was multivariate linear regression, to test the impact of the agglomeration and synergies in the specified region to affect competitiveness. as a result, the statistical significance of geographical allocation of the agglomeration and their intent to create synergies was display to contrast the hypothesis associated to the capabilities of the transportation logistics firms to become a cluster in the selected region, and their implications on supply chains.","agglomeration, logistics clusters, competitiveness, regional growth",,"engineering & technologies division, department of engineering universidad de monterrey san pedro garza garcía, nl, 66238, mexico teresa.verduzco@udem.edu",
178,The Impact Of Consumer Return Strategies On Omnichannel  Retailing,"(12 font) in this paper, we consider a retailer adopting the “omnichannel” sales policy that offers customers a more convenient option for shopping and buying. the retailer operates both a physical and a web-based online store. the web-based channel provides customers better shopping conveniences and detailed product information through websites and mobile apps; whereas physical store allows customers to physically inspect or even experience the product in the store the product before making a purchase decision. due to the uncertainty in product valuation, customers may end up returning the product purchased for a full or partial refund. hence, we develop a stylized game theoretic model to study the impact of consumer return strategies on retail sales and profitability. we show that product value and refund policy determine the online customer's choice of returning products through “online”, or at “store”. our analysis identifies the ideal conditions under which each return policy is beneficial to the retailer. further, we find that under full refund policy, the price of the product increases.","product returns, kolkata",,"prasenjit mandal department of operations management indian institute of management calcutta kolkata, 700104, india prasenjitm@iimcal.ac.in",
179,Fruiting Patterns Of Cacao As Affected  By Shading Regimes,"effects of different shading regimes (dense, moderate, and no shade) on the fruiting pattern of 2-3 years old cacao was investigated at the teaching and research farm of the federal university of technology akure, nigeria between october 2014 to april 2015 which marks the first production season of the cacao plants. plantain shade and no shade treatments that have been imposed on the cacao from establishment were studied to determine its effect on the fruiting pattern and yield. the treatments were dense shade, moderate shade and no shade which were arranged in a completely randomized design. no shade treatments significantly influenced pod production compared to dense and moderate shade at every period of data collection. more so, no significant difference was observed in the number of pods produced between moderately shaded plots and the densely shaded plots. no significant difference was observed among the treatments in weight of one pod, but the total pod weight was significantly higher under no shade compared with dense and moderately shaded plots. a number of beans per pod were not different significantly among the three-shade treatments. however fresh weight of bean per pod was significantly higher under no shade over other shade treatment. the total bean weight per treatment was significantly higher in no shade treatment compared to dense and moderately shaded plots. it was generally observed that pod production pattern in 2-3-year-old cacao production was positively influenced under no shade compared with dense and moderately shaded cacao.",cacao,and Recommendation Cocoa should be grown under no shade condition provided there is adequate provision for irrigation during the dry season and this will improve bean yield and quality in terms of average bean weight. It was also concluded that dense shade reduces pod formation in cacao. Pruning and dry season irrigation are recommended for cacao production. Pruning and dry season irrigation are recommended for cacao production. 2264,"medinat idowu akeredolu1 and timothy laseinde2 1department of agricultural technology, federal polytechnic ado - ekiti, ado, ekiti, nigeria 2department of mechanical & industrial engineering, university of johannesburg, akeredoluvincent@yahoo.com , otlaseinde@uj.ac.za","References

183,Process View On E-Health With Risk Analysis  Michal Švehla And Jiří Tupa,"as our technology evolves to be more patient oriented there is a bit of uncertainty about how the e-health works from process view. while there are many security questions that needs to be solved before using an e-health as a tool for a wide range of people, there is also a one about e-health itself. field of e-health is gaining more and more attention considering we are going through industry revolution 4.0. our research provides process perspective on this issue including a risk analysis together with structured process map from patient/user to his social worker either doctor, nurse or other medical personnel. this model should serve as a basic template for better understanding and easier implementing an e-health almost anywhere.","e-health, process, modeling, risk analysis",,"department of technologies and measurement regional innovation centre for electrical engineering (rice) faculty of electrical engineering university of west bohemia univerzitní 2732/8, 301 00 plzeň 3 svehlam@rice.zcu.cz, tupa@ket.zcu.cz",
184,Optimization Of Operating Parameters Of An Ingot Mold During Continuous Casting Case Of Slab A Content High Carbon,"currently, the axes research majority aims to improve continually the quality of continuously cast products. moreover, to guarantee this quality it is necessary to master operating parameters of casting machine, in particular, the primary cooling phase that takes place at level of ingot mold. the latter animated by an oscillatory movement, generally induces marks and defects on slab surface. indeed, during descent, the solidified crust is in compression, thus creating a negative sliding, this sliding time will help reduce the sticking risk, to close the rips of solid skin and to reduce the depth of oscillation marks. in addition, this time depends on casting speed and oscillation parameters of ingot mold (amplitude and frequency). the aim of this work is to optimize the operating parameters of ingot mold in this case the casting speed ""v"" and oscillations (amplitude ""a"", frequency ""f"") at means of box-behnken’s experimental design thus makes it possible to predict the healing rate ""τ"" which represents the ratio of sliding time and total cycle time. mathematical model have been obtained and the results show that for the case of carbon steel slab, strong sheet with a thickness of 250mm, it is recommended to use low speeds (v = 0.6m.mm-1) and large frequencies (n = 200cpm) associated with average amplitudes (a = 10mm) to achieve a value of τmax = 0.470 ± 0.048.","healing rate, optimization, continuous casting","The process of continuous steel casting is very complex and difficult to manage by fact that many phenomena interact at same time, master the parameters that govern it to improve productivity and product quality is the goal of all industrialists. In addition, the primary cooling in ingot mold is an essential step in this process, during this phase is forming a sufficiently strong skin to contain the liquid steel. Therefore, the adoption of parameters of machine (amplitude, frequency and speed) adequate will prevent the phenomenon of sticking and rips that may occur during exit of slab of the ingot mold. Furthermore, Box Behnken experimental designs can be a powerful tool for predicting most appropriate regime, which offers the best healing rate to allow consolidation of formed skin. Therefore, as a result of this simulation, mathematical model offer the advantage of predicting healing rate as a function of parameters (a, n and v) making it possible to optimization of this later contributes to clogging breaches of collage, to reduce marks of oscillations and mitigate risk of breakthrough. Thus, for case studied, low speeds respectively (v = 0.6m.mm-1) and high frequencies (n = 200cpm) as well as average amplitudes (a = 10mm) are most interesting parameters to improve the healing rate thus minimizing surface defects, thereby improving cast product quality.","mounira bourebia, sihem achouri, soumaya meddah, amel gharbi, oualid ghelloudj research center in industrial technologies crti, p.o.box 64 cheraga 16014 algiers, algeria mounirabourbia@gmail.com , m.bourebia@crti.dz , souma_sihem@yahoo.fr, soumaya.meddah@yahoo.com, ghelloudj23@gmail.com, lakhdar laouar university badji mokhtar bp 12-2300, laboratory of industrial mechanics, annaba, algeria lakla_55@yahoo.fr",
185,Promoting Supplier’S Environmental Innovation Via  Emission Taxation,"with growing concerns on pollutant emissions from manufacturing processes, emission taxation is becoming increasingly popular by many governments, aiming to incentivize firms’ emission reduction efforts. in some industries, however, the amount of pollutant emissions largely depends on the quality of the raw materials provided by suppliers, in which case motivating the suppliers’ environmental innovation efforts could be crucial for an effective regulatory control of pollutant emissions. nevertheless, many governments adopt the “polluter pays” principle and impose the emission taxes on the manufacturers. hence, a key question for the regulator in this context is whether such a tax burden on the manufacturers can effectively incentivize the suppliers’ environmental innovation through the supply chain contracts chosen by the profit maximizing manufacturers. thus motivated, this paper studies the impact of supply chain contracts in the presence of emission taxation on supplier’s environmental innovation by analyzing a monopoly model where the manufacturer sources raw material from a single supplier. we consider three contracts commonly observed in practice in this type of settings: i) wholesale price contract; ii) quality requirement contract; and iii) cost sharing contract. we find that the impact of each contract is quite different and show why increasing tax pressure may not necessarily enhance the supplier’s innovation effort. more importantly, our result shows that a very mild tax intensity can be most effective in maximizing the supplier’s environmental innovation investment. this result alleviates the widely agreed concern that emission taxation may negatively impact the end product market and hurt welfare. in addition, we show that it does not matter to whom the environmental tax is charged, and accordingly, double counting of emissions, i.e., charging the emission tax on the supplier as well, may discourage the supplier’s environmental innovation for all contracts we consider. our results highlight the importance of understanding the impacts of the supply chain contracts for the regulator to effectively motivate firm’s environmental innovation via emission taxation without severely choking the business. 1114",,,"bosung kim department of industrial engineering pusan national university pusan, south korea bskim.2753@gmail.com sang won kim department of decision sciences and managerial economics cuhk business school, the chinese university of hong kong hong kong sar skim@cuhk.edu.hk kun soo park department of industrial engineering seoul national university seoul, south korea kunsoo@snu.ac.kr",

191,Prediction Of The Friction Coefficient Of 13Cr5Ni2Mo Steel  Using Experiments Plans-Study Of Wear Behavior,"metal materials used in industrial applications deteriorate under the effect mechanical and chemical phenomena occurring under operating conditions, such as pipes carrying gas or fluid that are subject to internal wall wear. from where an experimental study was conducted through friction tests on supermartensitic stainless steel cr13ni5mo2, in order to estimate the effect of test parameters on friction coefficient and wear behavior of this steel by adopting the factorial plans 22 methodology at two factors (load ""p"" and linear sliding ""v""), each at two levels (-1, +1). the results have been demonstrated using a mathematical model predicting the coefficient of friction ""f"" in every point of the study field. the factorial plans make it possible to establish a modeling of the studied phenomenon with a maximum of efficiency and a minimum of experiences. the experimental results showed that the friction coefficient ""f"" reaches a max value for an applied load p=10n combined with a linear speed v=5cm/s. in addition, the wear morphology of surfaces after the friction test indicates that for 2n and at all speeds, friction is dominated by an abrasive wear mechanism. however, for 10n, it is observed the predominance of adhesive wear with a higher wear rate.","friction, factorial design, mathematical model","The coefficient of friction as well as the rate of wear is essential parameters which characterizes the lifetime of the materials. The experimental results obtained from friction tests using the methodology of factorial plans 22 contribute to quantitatively evaluating the effects of test parameters on the friction coefficient. The following conclusions can be drawn: - The mathematical model developed allowed to predict the coefficient friction ""f"" according to test parameters (P and V) in field of study. - The friction coefficient as well as wear rate depend on the test parameters, namely: the applied load and the linear sliding speed as well as the surface state of sample. - The isoréponses curves obtained by the model show that when the two factors (P, V) are at their lowest level, the coefficient of friction (f) decreases as well as the rate of wear. - Whatever the sliding speeds (min, max), we notice the predominance of abrasive wear for 2N load and adhesive wear for 10N load with a higher wear rate.

199,Review Methods To Solve Fractional Black-Scholes  Sevira Nurazizah,"the black-scholes model became popular and almost universally accepted by option traders to estimate and assess option prices over time. black-scholes model involves several assumptions that must be fulfilled, so sometimes the black-scholes model is difficult to apply to real life under certain conditions because of these assumptions. therefore, several models were developed to approach these assumptions, one of them is fractional black-scholes model. the model used in this paper is time-fractional black-scholes model. this paper begins with a brief description of the history of the black-scholes model then followed by an explanation of time-fractional black- scholes obtained from ordinary black-scholes models. the main points highlighted in this paper are the methods of solving the fractional black-scholes model. this paper aims to review the methods that have been successfully used in previous studies. like laplace homotopy perturbation method (lhpm), fractional variational iteration method, block-pulse operational matrix method, homo-separation of variables method, and several other methods. in reviewing these methods, this paper presents summary of the contexts that are worked out using these methods, conclusions and the efficiency of the methods, so that differences among the methods can be seen clearly.","option, fractional","This paper reviews the recent advances made in the Black-Scholes model and solution methods. Many researchers have attempted to obtain the solution of the Black-Scholes model analytically or numerically, thereby adopting and using various direct and iterative methods, respectively. There are a few methods that has the same solution in the end. For LHPM, the main advantage of this method is to overcome the deﬁciency that is mainly caused by unsatisﬁed conditions. Thus, it is said that the LHPM methodology is very powerful and eﬃcient in ﬁnding approximate solutions as well as numerical solutions. The fractional variational iteration method with Riemann-Liouville derivative shows that the present method is in excellent agreement with exact solution. It is proved with getting the exact solution in two iterations. A new lagrange multiplier whicih the modification of variational iteration method that is based on Sumudu Transform ﬁnds the analytical solution without any discretization or additive assumption. The analytical method has been applied in the form of convergent power series with easily computable components. Fractional partial differential equation to be solved is changed into fractional ordinary differential equation by using Homo-Separation of variables. It will be more easily if the equation is in the form of ordinary differential equation. So also with other methods that has their own efficiency and simplicity.

200,Review Strategies Of Optimal Crop Insurance Selection  Based On Climate Change,"climate change is a phenomenon that occurs continuously and is sensitive to the agricultural sector. future projections show that farmers will face several conditions, including warmer environments, uncertain rainfall patterns, and other extreme events. one of the adaptations to climate change in the agricultural sector is through crop insurance based on climate change. crop insurance can protect the financial implications of unexpected crop failures. currently, there are many crop insurance products offered, especially in developing countries. there are three types of crop insurance products, including actual production history (aph), crop revenue coverage (crc) and catastrophic (cat). the effort that can be made by farmers is to choose the appropriate crop insurance product. however, sometimes there is the adverse selection in crop insurance. this paper analyzes the types of crop insurance products based on climate change and strategies for determining the type of crop insurance products that are optimal by using conditional value-at- risk (cvar) for the avoidance of risk and loss selection. in addition, in this paper, several models have been proposed in previous studies.","climate change, cvar","Climate change is a phenomenon that occurs continuously. Using data on maximum temperature, minimum temperature, and rainfall, it is known that climate change and variability affect crop yields, harvest area, and agricultural productivity significantly. This shows that agricultural vulnerability to climate change requires an adaptation. Adaptation can be operational techniques, change management practices, and through financial management, such as using insurance. Agricultural insurance plays an important role in the adaptation between climate variations and agriculture so that it can be used to reduce risk. Agricultural insurance is the main component of risk management that can be used with climate information so that farmers use it to optimize the characteristics of risk returns. With the development of agricultural insurance, there are currently several agricultural insurance products, including Actual Production History (APH) or Multi-Peril Crop Insurance (MPCI), Crop Revenue Coverage (CRC) and Catastrophic (CAT). This allows for a potential tradeoff between farmers and insurance companies in having an optimal agricultural insurance contract with climate variability. However, if both parties are willing to show flexibility regarding their best choice, then farmers and insurance companies can achieve long-term sustainability without endangering economic stability.

In this study, it was conducted on a financial service. It consists of eight factors analyzed, but there are six factors that influence significantly the probability of failure. Estimated probability of default is estimated by the logistic regression model, which is then matched with the loan feasibility interval to obtain the title of each prospective debtor. Based on the predicate obtained, the prospective debtor will obtain a decision from a financial service whether or not the prospective debtor is granted a loan.

204,Generalized Transportation Relay Network Design  Amin Ziaeifar And Halit Uster,"the truckload industry faces a serious problem of high driver shortage and turnover rate, typically around 100\%. among the major causes of this problem are extended on-the-road times, where drivers handle several truckload pickup and deliveries successively, non-regular schedules and get-home rates, and low utilization of drivers dedicated time. these are by-and-large consequences of the driver-to-load dispatching method, which is based on point-to-point dispatching or direct shipment from origin to destination, commonly employed in the industry. we consider an alternative dispatching method that necessitates careful design of an underlying network. in this scheme, a truckload on its way to destination visits multiple relay nodes and the driver and/or tractor are switched with a new one so that drivers stay close to their base. some specific design characteristics include both direct and relay-network shipments, multi-route assignments, fixed relay costs, and route circuity, and coverage required for relay points. we present a mathematical model capturing these characteristics and a solution procedure based on strengthened benders decomposition enhanced with surrogate constraints and efficient heuristics. the solution approach is able to solve the large-scale problems, considering realistic inputs, in a reasonable time, and helps us to examine the performance of the rp-network. computational results demonstrate the performance of the algorithm.","network design, relay networks",,"department of engineering management, information, and systems southern methodist university dallas, tx, usa 75275, usa aziaeifar@mail.smu.edu, uster@smu.edu",

The gap analysis conducted on Environmental Management System development indicates that the City of Johannesburg must reduce on its unsustainable consumption patterns. The literature review section discussed initiatives, activities, plans and projects that have been undertaken by different government authorities globally to implement green public procurement. The government is well positioned to promote environmentally-friendly products and business activities through GPP policies or strategies that would encourage development and diffusion of environmentally sound goods and services in the procurement process. The results of the regression analysis indicated that the Cost of green products, Management Practices and Training and Awareness are significant factors of green implementation in the city of Johannesburg at 5% level of significance. The research also concludes that although the city of Johannesburg has made significant progress in adapting to green transition through various initiatives, green policy documents has to be developed and adopted at organizational level.

Its novelty comes from the simultaneous optimization of order quantities and number of shipments. Furthermore, the problem considered has features not studied yet in the optimization of such a problem in a three-echelon SCN, such as the allowance of backorder. The computational results obtained show that the proposed modelling approach, in addition to being novel, is capable of quickly finding optimal solutions for small-sized problem instances. In the near future, we will further our computational experiments and also develop heuristic approaches so that real- sized problem instances can be tackled.

224,The Effects Of The Fourth Industrial Revolution On The  Career Progression Of Engineers In The South African,"the manufacturing industry is facing a challenge to adapt to an ever changing business and operational environment. the fourth industrial revolution has brought a new set of challenges which requires a different approach to problem. hence, this study investigated the readiness of the case study company to operate in fourth industrial revolution. also identified the set of competencies and career ladders to develop engineers in industry 4.0. the scope of the study was limited to the engineering department within the case study company to assess the readiness, set of engineering competencies and career ladders for engineers in industry 4.0. the study used a survey questionnaire to collect primary data from a sample of 64 employees within the engineering departments. the study used relative important index (rii) to assess the readiness of the organization to operate in industrial 4.0. the exploratory factor analysis was used to identify the set of competencies required for engineers in industry 4.0. all the items were found to have the rii more than 60% with automated manufacturing scoring a high (rii =83%) and customer driven (rii = 80%). the leadership and entrepreneurship were identified as two groups of competencies brought by industry 4.0 in the engineering field.",industry 4.0,Engineering employees play an integral role in this technology driven economy in contributing into the competitiveness and future potentials of the organization. The research explored the career paths that engineering employees are exposed to throughout their careers and focused on the two stakeholders affected by the fourth industrial revolution. These stakeholders are the engineering employees and the organization. 5.1 To the Engineers The responsibility of career progression is personal in nature. Engineering employees need to ensure that they obtain the relevant competencies and requirements that will lead them to a prospective career growth by getting involved in understanding the organizations strategies and goals. Engineering employees need to comprehend that sufficient service with broader knowledge of the organization in part with the relative education are essential for career growth. The fourth industrial revolution is changing the nature of how the organizations are doing business. Engineering employees need to understand the changing technologies with regards to aligning themselves with the nature of business. Engineering employees need to assess their competencies to align with the engineering competencies of the fourth industrial revolution. Industry 4.0 requires engineering competencies that are more wide ranging than the historical technical competencies. The industry 4.0 characteristics are totally different from the third industrial revolution with the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and the internet of things (IoT). 5.2 To the Organization The three possible structural options for engineering employees need to be visible. Information and training for each pillar needs to be relayed to the employees to understand that there is more than one option for engineering employees in the organization. The organization needs to promote a culture of career progression to remove any stagnation in the organization and promote fair competitiveness for growth. The organization should formulate career progression models that are clearly defined with their requirements that will be readily available for potential career prospects. These will be hierarchy guidelines set by the organization in regards to career planning to remove any ambiguities in relations to the different available roles in the organization. These models should identify the core competencies and set of standards of performance of each role the engineer would undertake. With regards to industry 4.0 the organization should consider aligning their structures more towards the changes being influenced by technology. Aligning with these changes would ensure the organization succeeds and increases its competitiveness in the manufacturing and packaging sector. 6.,"packaging industry gcina mduduzi nzima post-graduate school of engineering management, university of johannesburg, south africa gcinanzima@gmail.com hannelie nel post-graduate school of engineering management, university of johannesburg, south africa hannelien@uj.ac.za bheki makhanya post-graduate school of engineering management, university of johannesburg, south africa bheki.makhanya@transnet.net","references among Canadian engineers,  Journal

225,Mistakes In System Dynamics Models: An Educational  Issues From The Systems Engineering Perspective,"systems engineering and development of system dynamics models are strongly interconnected. during this process of system construction, system dynamics modelling represents a useful approach to simulation of system behaviour over time and to support the quality and suitability of related decision. appropriate application of systems thinking during the whole modelling process plays a crucial role and it is both problematic and challenging. this paper focuses on the identification of the issues occurring during the modelling process. the applied methods incorporates the experimental set-up, direct observation of modellers and qualitative analysis of developed models. consequently, the list of identified drawbacks linked with particular systems thinking track is developed. the identified mistakes together with their linkage with type of thinking are summarised in a useful overview of what could and should be omitted or eliminated during the system dynamics modelling. results reveal that operational thinking represents the most challenging thinking track. it is followed by non-linear, analytical, critical and structural thinking. based on the achieved results, the modellers could analyse and revise their approaches and thinking patterns. these can be reconsidered and appropriately adapted following the principles of the correct application of systems thinking during system dynamics modelling.","systems engineering, system dynamics, system thinking, modelling process","Systems thinking represents a skill that needs to be mastered by systems engineers in order to help them to develop meaningful system dynamics models that can support proper decision-making and comprehensive view. The mistakes in the application of systems thinking might cause significant problems and lead in inappropriate and course of action in decisions, predictions, situational analysis etc. This paper introduced some of these issues based on the observation and assessment of the system dynamics model creation. The sample modellers repeated a set of aforementioned mistakes. These were connected either with causal-loop or stock-and-flow diagrams. Moreover, it was possible to link them with particular types of thinking. The provided identification of problematic issues, inappropriate approaches, assumptions or conclusions aims to help modellers and prospect users of models to avoid or eliminate the mentioned mistakes. As revealed in this study, the operational thinking represents the most challenging thinking track. It is followed by non-linear, analytical, critical and structural thinking. Therefore, these skills should be (together with all the other types of thinking) practiced in pursuit to be appropriately used in transformation of the systems thinking in action.

The low technological level in CSSC is the main obstacle in developing competitiveness. Other obstacles are the lack of a) production capacity, b) innovation, research and development (R&D), c) exports, d) product quality, f) strong government policies in terms of price fixing and market protection, and g) tax incentives to specific industries. Thus, the proposed model in KM would be used to encourage industrial cooperation, to share information, knowledge, and raise CSSC competitiveness. Low technological development and a lack of interest from SC stakeholders seem to be the main barriers in the development of a KM model in CSSC.

229,Analysis Of Energy Efficiency Between Conventional And  Insulated Wall House In Australia,"the residential housing sector consumes a significant amount of fossil fuel energy and thereby the sector generates a large percentage of greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to global warming and climate change. at present, approximately 39% of the total household energy used is required for space heating/cooling and a substantial amount of that energy is lost through the house walls. additionally, the floor space area and volumetric dimension of modern residential houses are increasing at a constant rate in most developed countries including australia. this additional space also requires energy for heating and cooling. therefore, the energy consumption for heating and cooling and greenhouse gas emissions will be increasing rapidly. a continuous upward energy consumption trend in residential housing sector worldwide will continue for years to come unless energy efficient and carbon neutral house wall systems are developed. one of the biggest challenges is to develop a smart house wall system made of thermal mass and insulation materials that can provide reduced energy needs for on-going heating and cooling with lower carbon footprint as most house wall construction materials are very energy intensive and have large carbon footprints. in order to develop a new energy smart house wall system, a study has been undertaken on thermal performance of two house wall systems (one is currently used conventional brick veneer house wall and other is an alternative house wall). the thermal performance (heat gain or loss through the wall) has been determined using computational modeling and experimental measurements. the effects of various climate conditions on these two house wall systems have also been determined. the findings indicate that the house with insulation material provides better thermal efficiency than that of currently used conventional house wall. key words thermal performance, energy efficiency, thermal mass and insulation material. 1. introduction the expansion of global economy and population growth has led to the expansion of cities and urbanization. this expansion has dramatically increased not only the demand for new buildings and houses but also energy need. for example, in 2020, the energy consumption in the australian residential house sector will be almost 467 pj compared to 299 pj in 1990 which means the demand will increase by over 50%. the number of residential houses is expected to be around 10 million in 2020 compared to 6 million in 1990. in most developed countries, the demand for residential buildings has been rapidly increasing due to population growth. more buildings and houses need more energy. figure 1 illustrates the increasing trend the housing sector energy consumption for coming years. additionally, the average floor space of new australian residential houses is increasing progressively. as a result, the energy consumption is also increasing for the additional space heating and cooling. this additional energy consumption leads to higher co2 emissions [3]. 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 2015 2020 energy consumption (pj) year figure 1. energy consumption in housing sector © ieom society international 2302",,"The paper presents a thermal performance modelling of two house wall systems (conventional and new) for six Australian cities.

This algorithm is used in many fields, such as machining, biomechanics and the inspection of fabricated parts. The main purpose of the ICP algorithm is to find the optimal rigid body displacement between two sets of data. This alignment algorithm allows recalibrating the measured surface (point clouds) on the CAD model (theoretical model). Subsequently, approaches to improve the performance of the ICP algorithm are proposed. A first test allowed to test the selection of the points of the two models. It allowed us to show and validate that the point selection method was effective. In addition, the proposed method makes it possible to accelerate the ICP algorithm significantly. On the other hand, it is not guaranteed for the estimation of the optimal rigid transformation. The second test concerns the convergence speed of the ICP algorithm. His test is compared both basic and improved algorithms. It allowed us to show that the Delaunay triangulation method is faster than the basic method, which is logical because the number of points has been reduced. The third test realized also improves the performance of the ICP algorithm, but also to highlight the effect of the minimization techniques used in the ICP algorithm. The test clearly shows that the kd-tree method is the most efficient towards a stable and fast solution. The inspection method used is based on the ICP algorithm. When there is a lot of measurement noise in the point cloud, the ICP converges to a false minimum. In future works, new ways could be explored to limit this noise.

The nodes of such a network are so called smart factories which are connected to a larger value-chain network that fulfils a certain customer demand. Machines and materials are the assets that are located at the bottom line of the whole automation pyramid but are all well integrated through standardized interfaces. Materials and products are uniquely identifiable and locatable at all times during the manufacturing process and as well along their entire life-cycle.

236,Mistakes In Managing Local Community; Exploring The  Case Of Repsol In Canary Islands,"this paper aims at learning from the mistakes of a single case in which the mismanagement of the relationships with the local community stakeholder has resulted in extensive social protests against the project and its shut down. interviews with local authorities and journalists reflected their perception from repsol’s behaviour during the period starting from oil prospection initiating phase in early millennium till 2015 when the project was completely abandoned by the project organization. the results of the exploratory case study revealed that the shareholder orientation of the project organization has resulted in several mistakes in community management policies and have eventually amplified the opposition against the project. lack of transparency, reluctance to build trustful relationship with the local community, lack of respect to the local community’s dignity and prioritization of the shareholders’ demands and values over those of the local government and community have resulted in being recognized as illegitimate and invalid.","stakeholder, ethic, local community",,"roya derakhshan department of department of management, economics and industrial engineering politecnico di milano milano, italy school of industrial engineering universidad politécnica de madrid madrid, spain roya.derakhshanalavijeh@polimi.it victor gomez frias school of industrial engineering universidad politécnica de madrid madrid, spain victor.gomez.frias@upm.es","References:

237,Assessing Due Date Fulfillment For Lumber Manufacturing  Production Orders,"lumber production planning can be classified as a general lot sizing and scheduling problem, which has been addressed with mip formulations and myopic methods. these models allow backlogs, inventory, and sequence dependent set-ups based on due date of orders, but they do not analyze the effect on costs. the research conducted in this field until now focused on fulfillment of demand for lumber in a certain period without questioning the manufacturing cost of this policy. my research determines the opportunity cost of a multi-period lp approach in comparison with order-processing sequences. i conducted a study to determine the cost of scheduling sequences to process production orders. first, i built a multi-period mip model (pl) where demands must be satisfied in a certain period of the planning horizon, without explicit orders and due dates. a relaxed version of the pl model allowing backlogs without penalties was also built. second, i added a production sequence to test how sequences to process orders affected their due dates and called this model planning-scheduling (ps). the periods of the formulation were dropped and an “earliness” constraint that forced orders to be processed without violating their due dates was added. earliest due date (e), longest processing time (l), and shortest processing time (s) heuristics sequences were used to sort orders which were then fed to the dss. a relaxed version of this ps model allowing overdue orders (i.e., relaxing the earliness constraint) without penalization was also built. the pl model and its relaxed version plr were solved with five sizes of demand, and the ps model and its relaxed psr version were solved with five sizes of orders. the demand and sum of the orders were equivalent in volume, and order due dates occurred in the corresponding periods. the pl approach was the cheapest, although with a small cost gap in comparison to the ps with an e sequence. however, when relaxing overdue orders, this last approach was as efficient as pl, with lower backlogged volumes (high fulfillment of order due dates). thus, the ps with an e sequence is proposed as the best approach to plan lumber production orders in sawmilling operations. although the percentage differences in costs of the planning and scheduling approaches psa-scenarios were not dramatic, the economic effect of the ps with an e sequence could be significant given the operational scale of this type of facility. moreover, the ps with an e sequence showed the ability to reduce the backlog ratio close to zero, when the corresponding pl backlog ratio was 14%. i did not apply any penalties for backlogs because of the subjective nature of these costs; however, when shortages occurred the demand was lost or backlogged with substantial costs. therefore, if i adopt my planning approach using a conservative backlog cost, sawmill which produces 300,000 m3 or 125,000 mbf per year would reduce backlogged orders by 42 thousand m3 (i.e., 14% backlog reduction). if the holding lumber cost is 2 us$/m3, annual savings would be $336,000.","lumber, planning, scheduling, backlogs, orders 1370",,"francisco p. vergara wood engineering department, faculty of engineering the university of bio-bio collao avenue 1202, casilla 5-c, concepción, chile fvergara@ubiobio.cl",

242,A Clustering Algorithm For Location Routing Problem With  Outsourced Delivery,"in this paper, the location routing problem (lrp) with outsourced delivery is studied. the objective of lrp is to determine the best combination of depot locations and vehicle routes that minimizes the total costs. in the classical lrp, all products are delivered with non-outsourced delivery, which is the delivery mode where all customers are included in the delivery routes. non-outsourced delivery is efficient if customers are densely located. however, if customers are sparsely located, outsourced delivery is more efficient. in outsourced delivery, products are delivered to customers directly by third-party delivery services. in this study, the outsourced delivery mode is added to the lrp model so that suitable transportation modes are selected. introducing this model makes the lrp more complicated. to solve the problem efficiently, a clustering-based heuristic is proposed. test instances based on lrp benchmark instances were solved by using the algorithm. the results of our computational experiments showed the proposed algorithm can find a 20% better solution than mip within an hour for problems with a hundred customers.",,"To improve delivery efficiency, we proposed a new location routing problem (LRP) model with outsourced delivery. The model includes not only selection of depot location and vehicle routes, but also selection of delivery mode, that is selection of non-outsourced delivery or outsourced delivery. And a clustering-based heuristic is proposed to solve LRP with outsourced delivery. The algorithm divides the original LRP into smaller problems to make it easier to solve, without reducing the optimization potential as much as possible. The idea of clustering is not to divide all customers into clusters, but to cluster only close customers. In the next step, non-clustered customers are assigned to vehicles by MIP. The computer experiments on small-scale problems showed that the case in which about 80% of the customers were grouped into a cluster could get better solutions. Test instances based on LRP benchmark instances were solved 1388","junko hosoda faculty of science and technology sophia university, tokyo, japan center for technology innovation – production engineering hitachi ltd., kanagawa, japan junko.hosoda.dp@hitachi.com takashi irohara faculty of science and technology sophia university, tokyo, japan irohara@sophia.ac.jp","References

245,Teaching Assistantship Assignment Optimization Using  Hungarian Algorithm – A Case Study,"teaching assistantship (ta) assignment is typically a time-consuming and enduring process due to conflicting constraints and multiple objectives. this project involves assigning ta assignments to a large pool of candidates over a smaller set of offered courses, all the while ensuring that fairness is maintained during the assignment. a program was developed to address and optimize based on the given constraints and objectives. it begins with a data collection phase where all relevant information on the candidates and courses is acquired and then a software program is used to optimize the ta assignment using the hungarian algorithm. the model was initially formulated as a multi-objective function consisting of three objectives viz., course/instructor preference, student preference and income deviation among candidates. it was then scalarized into a single weighted-sum objective function. the optimizer was tested on candidates applying for teaching assistantship towards three separate semesters, yielding an average of 60-70% matching with the manual assignments that were previously carried out by the department. the statistical dispersion in optimization cost and matching extent towards the manual assignment was observed under the different set of weights. higher assignment deviations would extend the pareto domain, which also results in more favorable optimization costs.",data analysis,"The project attempted to replicate the TA assignment computationally via the Hungarian algorithm and was successful in achieving the desired objectives. The developed VBA script was able to successfully extract all necessary candidate and preference information from the TA application metadata, and parse the income history of each candidate, then carry out the optimization procedure. Optimization involving minimizing the objective function was carried out on the developed model that had three individual sub-objective functions accounting for the income deviation, student-course preferences, and vice versa. The three objectives were averaged into a single function using a vector of three weights represented as Barycentric coordinates. The optimizer was tested on candidates applying for teaching assistantships in three separate semesters, yielding an average of 60-70% matching extent from the manual assignments previously carried out by the department. This was done across 37 different combinations of varying weight vectors. The statistical dispersion in optimization cost and matching extent towards the manual assignment was analyzed using different set of weights. If the number of available tasks and registered student preferences were more balanced and not clustered towards a few courses (termed allocation odds), the more susceptible the model was towards assignment deviations.

246,Life Cycle Assessment Of Residential Buildings Considering  Photovoltaic Systems,"nowadays, energy consumption in the building sector is considered one of the main contributors to increased carbon dioxide (co2) emissions, which is having an enormous negative environmental impact worldwide. correspondingly, rising co2 emissions have become a global environmental issue. life cycle assessments (lcas) have been deployed for evaluation of the ecological impact of the building sector will be used to analyze and assess ecological effects. the primary objective of this research is to consider the different phases of life cycle energy and co2 analysis of a pv system integrated residential building by designing geometry, spaces, and thermal zones in sketch up and simulating the building and calculating the energy load in energyplus. for illustrative purposes, a single residential building in toronto was simulated. moreover, carbon emissions of the residential building were calculated through lca and compared with the case of added pv systems. it was found that there would be a significant reduction in operating cost, energy cost, and co2 emissions. however, the capital cost would increase by integrating pv systems, but it would be less significant considering a higher carbon tax in the future.",,"In this study, the different phases of life cycle energy and CO2 analysis of a PV system integrated residential building considered. We used the signal residential building located in Toronto in this study. EnergyPlus, SketchUp, and Open Studio were the software programs utilized for modeling the building. The benefit of this study is reduced energy consumption, higher energy efficiency and environmental benefits of CO2 emission reduction. The life cycle analysis is an effective method to reduce energy consumption and CO2 emissions. The results show that the energy consumption of the single residential building was affected by many weather variables. High and low temperature and humidity in the air affect HVAC system usage, which affects energy consumption and related CO2 emission levels. Besides, carbon dioxide emissions from space heating HVAC systems for a single residential building is higher than business as the usual electricity generation system. Moreover, hot water uses the largest amount of energy compared to other energy sources in SRB, which leads to increased carbon dioxide emissions. On other hand, propane water uses the lowest amount of energy compared to other energy sources in SRB, and it represents the smallest amount of CO2 emissions compared to other sources. In addition, the results quantify the annual CO2 emissions by considering the occupants, the energy impacts of specific electronic equipment and some places of SRB pointed that car park ventilation represents the lowest amount of CO2 emissions annually compared to other impact energy sources; hot water uses a significant amount of electricity compared to other equipment in the building, and this leads to increasing carbon dioxide emissions each year. Finally, the results of the life cycle energy analysis show that there would be a significant reduction in operating cost, energy cost, and CO2 emissions. However, the capital cost would increase by integrating PV systems, but it would be less significant than higher future carbon taxes. 1416","dhia jabri, lena ahmadi and ali elkamel2 chemical engineering department, university of waterloo, waterloo, ontario, canada djabri@uwaterloo.ca, lena.ahmadi@gmail.com aelkamel@uwaterloo.ca chandra mouli r. madhuranthakam chemical engineering department, abu dhabi university abu dhabi, united arab emirates p.o.box. 59911 chandra.mouli@adu.ac.ae 2- chemical engineering department, khalifa university of science and technology, abu dhabi, united arab emirates, p.o.box. 2533 ali.elkamel@ku.ac.ae","References

247,Statistical And Kinetic Modeling For Investigating Acetyl  Salicylic Acid Stability,"drug stability is one of the vital subjects in the pharmaceutical industry. all drug products should be kept stable and protected against any chemical, physical, and microbiological degradation to ensure their efficacy and safety until released for public use. hence, stability is very important to be estimated or predicted. this work involved studying the stability of drug agent using three different mathematical models. these models included both empirical models (linear regression), and mechanistic (kinetic) models. the stability of the drug in the three cases studied was expressed in terms of concentration, hardness, temperature and humidity. the predicted values obtained from the models were compared to the observed values of drug concentrations obtained experimentally and then evaluated by calculating the mean of squared. among the models used in this work, the mechanistic model was found to be the most accurate and reliable method of stability testing given the fact that it had the smallest calculated errors. overall, the accuracy of these mathematical models as indicated by the proximity of their stability measurements to the observed values, led to the assumption that such models can be reliable and time-saving alternatives to the analytical techniques used in practice.","regression models, stability, data analysis","Stability testing requires vigorous work and lengthy studies. Analytical techniques have been the commonly used methods in drug stability testing. These techniques include high performance liquid chromatography (HLPC) or thin layer chromatography (HPTLC), gas chromatography (GC) and electrophoresis. Recently, there has been a new trend towards the use of statistical modelling techniques. The modelling techniques commonly used nowadays are the empirical models such as linear regression, artificial neural network, and the mechanistic models. Such techniques are thought to be reliable and economic alternatives with the advantage of time saving. To assess the reliability and applicability of statistical modelling in studying drug stability and estimating its degradation with time and to know whether statistical modeling can efficiently substitute the ordinary analytical methods, several models were applied in this research on ASA which was chosen from the pharmaceutical literature. Three different models (linear regression, artificial neural network and mechanistic models) were implemented to predict the drug concentration over time. These predicted values were compared to the observed values and then evaluated by calculating the mean of square errors (MSE) to determine how close those values were to the exact values resulted experimentally. Moreover, the coefficient of determination (R2) was calculated to further evaluate the model accuracy as well. This work focussed on the stability of acetyl salicylic acid (ASA) tablets. The concentration of ASA at variable temperatures (35, 40, 45, 50 ͦ C) was determined experimentally at different time intervals using HPLC. Firstly, a linear regression model was proposed, and the unknown parameters were estimated and found to be significant as concluded from ANOVA table. The errors were found to be normally distributed with a mean equal to zero and the residuals residual had a random pattern as seen in normal probability and the residual plots, respectively. The MSE was 6.33, and R2 was 84.67%. This meant that the regression model represents the data very well. Secondly, the artificial neural network was applied, and it was able to capture the relationships between the inputs and the output in the testing datasets despite the limited number of the experimental data (21 data points). The MSE was 1.5168 whereas the R2 was 94% indicating a high accuracy for artificial neural network model as well. The third model applied was the mechanistic model. This model was linearized to determine the decomposition rate constants (kApp) at various temperatures and the order of the reaction (α). The hydrolysis process was found to follow first order kinetic dependent only on the concentration of one reactant; i.e. aspirin.

248,Multi-Criteria Supplier Selection For Implementing Lean Six  Sigma Using Fuzzy Ahp,"sustainability of lean six sigma (lss) model relies upon the purchasing strategy of the organization’s supply chain individuals which makes the supplier selection strategies basic for implementing lss. supplier selection is a major consideration for meeting an organization’s need consistently at an allowable price range through identifying the suppliers with highest potential. for the firms who are willing to apply lss, supplier selection strategy becomes a factor of paramount significance as this model focuses on eliminating waste. yet there is no current study which discussed about the supplier evaluation strategy for implementing lss. thus, this paper aspires to aid the decision making of supplier assessment through determining the decision criteria and supplier evaluation for actualizing lss. the suggested model incorporates fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (ahp) to pinpoint the supplier panel with highest potential. the focus of this paper is to assist the upstream management of supply chain to draw out the best outcome of lean six sigma implementation.","lean six sigma, supplier selection",,"ferdous sarwar, farzana islam, md sadman sakib, sampa halder department of industrial & production engineering bangladesh university of engineering & technology dhaka, bangladesh ferdoussarwar@ipe.buet.ac.bd",
249,Optimizing A Solid Waste Management Model Using  Particle Swarm Optimization,"in today’s world, the number of industries is increasing geometrically for accomplishing the demand of a rapidly growing population. with this growing number of industries, the total amount of production is also accelerating. and no production is possible without generating waste. appropriate waste management is an appropriate way for making the world a comfortable habitat. to achieve the apex of the competitive production process, ecological incorporated manufacturing and recycle planning is of incredible significance. so non-avertable byproducts and wastes ought to be recycled by the manufacturer. in this study, a mathematical model is developed for optimizing the cost of recycling and solid waste management. for optimization particle swarm optimization (pso) method is used to identify the level of disposed solid waste and recycled solid waste. another meta-heuristic algorithm named genetic algorithm (ga) is used for evaluating the efficiency of the result getting from pso. 1. introduction management of waste is a process by which waste is controlled appropriately from the generation of waste to the final phase of waste management. this incorporates the gathering, transport, treatment and transfer of waste, together with checking and guideline of the waste administration process (pongrácz, 2003). waste can be solid, fluid, or vaporous and each sort has distinctive strategies for disposal and the executives. in this study, only solid waste is considered. form the study of different industries shows that there is a large gap exist between theory and practical implementation of different waste management process only because of thinking that waste management is expensive. but with appropriate management of waste the cost can be reduced. there is a strong connection between ecological coordinated effort and sustainability execution (kjaerheim, 2003). the contribution of this study is to emphasize the ecological concern as an unseparated part of the industrial organization. next contribution is environmental thinking along with cost minimization. with the appropriate management of waste, the cost of the production process is automatically reduced (bruno, 2016). in this study, recycle and dispose of waste is considered as the two process of managing solid waste. conversion of waste material into a useful material is known as recycling process. thus, the cost of production can be optimized. the steps of solid waste management are collecting the waste from production floor, storing them for proper management, passing through a treatment process, recycling the suitable material, finally, disposing the rest of the waste. so, recycle and dispose are the two main process of managing solid waste. waste is disposed when there is no value exist in the waste that can be used for production of new goods (costi, 2004). in this study, mathematical models for recycle and disposal cost are developed. then the model will be solved with particle swarm optimization (pso) approach. finally, compare the result with a metaheuristic algorithm known as genetic algorithm (ga). 2. literature review eco-efficiency is perceived as an imperative instrument to assess all the while the natural and the financial difficulties of an organization (carvalho, 2017). in present business condition, just as contending on expense and profitability, associations have another attention on sustainability (zhang, 2016). some research works deals with mathematical or simulation analysis for analyzing the relationship between recycle, reuse and rework (govindan, 1799",,"In this study, mathematical model is developed for optimizing the cost for the management of solid waste. For developing this model recycle cost, disposal cost is considered. Fixed demand rate per period and no volume discount are assumed for formulating the objective function. At first, cost function is developed for these systems separately. Then the objective function is developed by combining all these separate mathematical models. PSO and GA methods are used for optimizing the model. The optimum solutions obtained from PSO and GA methods are all most same. There is a very small deviation (<2.5%) between these two optimum objective function values.

250,Business Process Modeling For Tracing Halal Food  Using Bpmn,"since traceability of halal food is not talking any longer about one step backward and one step forward and only can be done in inbound logistic, therefore we have to do business process reengineering as a strategy and methodology to make it happens along logistic activities. as we know logistic activities consist of inbound and outbound logistic, where halal traceability in inbound logistic has been implemented quite well that is why we have to discuss it in outbound logistic as a scope in this research. one of the features of business process reengineering is to capture the existing process and represent new processes adequately. business process modeling plays a crucial role in such efforts. this paper proposes a structure for modeling business process in order to capture essential concepts of tracing halal food in its distribution activities and represent them structurally. the structure possesses two main features suitable for business process modeling: one is that it can represent critical processes and the sequences in the distribution of halal food, and the other is that it shows how to trace during the distribution of halal food by the information provided. since the problem of tracing halal food is a probability function, so we do formulation by stochastic dynamic programming to develop the computation model. the computation model is a mathematical model and then how it operates in the tracing processes should be figured out in its business process model. the objective function of this computation model is to minimize the cost of halal food traceability activities. the business process modeling method is illustrated by an order fulfillment tracing processes in the stages of distribution of halal food using bpmn. the use case of this business process model explains the role and the interaction of the activities of the actors in doing transfer information of the halal food at their critical processes. the internal actors of the ecosystem are the distributor, retailer, transporter, and warehouse company while the external actors involve supplier of halal food and halal certification body and government as the parties that have responsibilities to assure the halalness of the food distributed in the market. when the business process model is valid, it will be simulated in halal food traceability system.","halal food, bpmn, traceability. 1432",,"yulita veranda usman agroindustrial engineering department, bogor agricultural university, bogor industrial engineering department, pancasila university, jakarta indonesia yulita@univpancasila.ac.id anas miftah fauzi agroindustrial engineering department bogor agricultural university bogor, indonesia anasfauzi@ipb.ac.id tun tedja irawadi chemistry department bogor agricultural university bogor, indonesia tun@ipb.ac.id",
251,Solving The Dynamic Facility Layout Problem Using  Dynamic Programing,"the facility layout problem (flp) is all about obtaining the optimal arrangement of machines or departments in a given area or plant. most of the research in the area of the flp assumes that the material flow between the departments is constant. however, in today’s competitive and volatile manufacturing environments, this assumption does not usually hold. layouts constantly need to be changed from one period to the other to adapt to the changes in the product mix and demand. the dynamic facility layout problem (dflp) searches for a layout for each period of the planning horizon minimizing its respective total material handling costs, for all periods, as well as the total rearrangement costs between successive periods. because of the prohibitive combinatorial nature of dflp, absolute optimality is not usually sought and larger instances of the problem are solved using near-optimal algorithms. in this paper, dynamic programming (dp) is used to solve the dflp problem. the layouts considered in each period forms the state space for dp; the problem is decomposed to stages— one for each dflp period. this state space is arrived at using a hybridized heuristic approach that includes the use of a simulated annealing (sa) metaheuristic. consistent with the rest of the literature, the proposed method is comprised of two phases; in the first phase, the set space to be considered and searched in each phase of dp are arrived at using sa and two different heuristic procedures. to obtain these layouts and for smaller manageable instances of the problem, exact optimum layout for each period is found by solving the qap formulation of the static facility layout problem. as for larger instances and due to the inherent combinatorial nature of the problem, sub-optimum layouts for each period are arrived at using sa. two other heuristics are utilized to complete the set space of layouts for each stage by applying different neighborhood functions to the previously obtained exact- and sub-optimum solutions. in the second phase, the dp recursive formulation is solved. computational experience exhibits promise.","dynamic programing, tehran, iran",,"saeideh salimpour and ahmed azab production and operations management research lab university of windsor 401 sunset avenue, n9b 3p4, windsor, on, canada {salimpo, azab}@uwindsor.ca",

255,A Hierarchical Facility Location-Allocation Model For The  Maternal Healthcare In India,"maternal healthcare is very important for india from social, economic and development perspectives. success in terms of decreasing mortality rate is directly related to the extent of provision of related healthcare facilities. in similar countries with more number of poor people, facility location decisions would naturally require the least expenses to be incurred on transportation cost by the facility-seekers for visiting these facilities. maternal healthcare facilities are to provide primary care to all mothers-to-be, with some to provide facilities for routine birth, and some others for the non-routine birth and neonatal assistance to high-risk babies. in countries including india, where the funds for the development of such facilities are limited, each facility cannot be conceived to have all the care requirements and, besides, all the mothers-to-be may not require the services of the facilities with neonatal care. due to these practical considerations, the governments may try to find right mix of these facilities each at different geographic location to provide primary healthcare support, basic support with facilities for normal birth, and with additional support for premature birth and neonatal care. thus the capacity of a facility type at a location will be defined separately for each type of associated healthcare support provided. depending upon the requirement, a mother-to-be may be taken from one facility type to another advanced one and this will also involve transportation cost. to avoid a mother-to-be to visit a far off health facility, a network design restriction is considered in terms of maximum distance to be covered by her. within this distance itself, all the required facilities are to be available. to determine the location of such facilities and allocation of all mothers-to-be to these facilities, a successively inclusive hierarchical mathematical model has been proposed in this paper that aims to minimize the total of the cost of visiting the facilities by the mothers-to-be and the fixed cost of the facilities. a numerical example has been taken to illustrate the use of the model. a python program, linking the model with gurobi 8.0.1 optimization software, has been developed to solve the numerical example. to prove the properness of the functionality of the proposed model, impact of the increase in the number of the mothers-to-be has been studied on the location and allocation decisions. the analysis carried out proves the validity of the model as the changes in the location and allocation decisions are supportive of the changes conceived.","maternal healthcare, neonatal care",,"ankit chouksey mechanical engineering department, iit(bhu), varanasi, india 221005, ankitchouks.rs.mec17@itbhu.ac.in a. k. agrawal professor, mechanical engineering department, iit(bhu), varanasi, india 221005, akagrawal.mec@itbhu.ac.in ajinkya n. tanksale assistant professor, mechanical engineering department, iit(bhu), varanasi, india 221005, ajinkya.mec@itbhu.ac.in",
256,Inverted Hockey Stick Effect In The European Industry:  Inventory Reduction In The Last Fiscal Quarter,"inventory management decisions are critical to industrial companies’ efficiency and performance. this paper aims to identify a pattern, coined by (hoberg et al., 2017) as “inverted hockey stick effect“, of a systematic reduction of inventory (raw materials, work in progress, finished products and the sum of these) of european industrial companies in the last fiscal quarter. such reduction would correspond to a conscient management decision, with an impact on the supply chain, something that may not be in line with strictly operational needs. the theoretical basis of this paper is the study from (hoberg et al., 2017), where a systematical inventory reduction in the last fiscal quarter was detected in a sample of 4877 north american industrial companies between 1990 - 2010. the use of inventory days as a variable, integrates companies’ economic activity by taking into consideration the cogs when analysing inventory behaviour. because a reduction of inventory can result from a peak of sales, the “inverted hockey stick effect” reduction of inventory must be noticeable in all three components (rm, wip, fp). the quarterly data concerning the period 2008 - 2017, were obtained from compustat® using the s&p capital iq® interface, filtered by region (europe) and classification (industry). in this preliminary study, we state the following propositions: proposition 1 – companies promote inventory reduction in the last fiscal quarter proposition 2 – the inventory reduction in the last fiscal quarter is identified in all three components (rm, wip, fp) 1458",,,"nuno guedes vieira faculty of economics university of porto porto, portugal up199301735@fep.up.pt catarina delgado liaad-inesc tec and faculty of economics university of porto porto, portugal cdelgado@fep.up.pt josé antónio moreira faculty of economics university of porto porto, portugal jantonio@fep.up.pt",

In order to obtain an accurate temperature and extrusion speed data to make bioplastic films, so it can comply correctly with the previously established specifications. Alternatively, one of the main characteristics to consider in the project is the application of bioplastic in different industrial areas as part of evaluating its different uses. One of its uses, is the use of this bioplastic as a replacement for packaging material in products such as: food, cookies, bags used for fruits in supermarkets, which has a very high degradation life and a very low consumption life.

259,Horizontal Collaboration To Reduce Traffic Congestion:  Opportunities For Industries Of Bangladesh By Improving,"collaboration in supply chain is widely recognized as one of the core challenges for the next future. in this context, horizontal collaboration is believed to be one of the innovative solutions to tackle the growing logistic challenges from both, environmental and economic points of view. in this paper, a close look has been taken on the horizontal collaboration opportunities across industry sectors of bangladesh to reduce traffic burden, capture more opportunities and make their supply chain more efficient. horizontal collaboration is characterized by the sharing of information, knowledge, risk and profits among industries working in the same level of supply chain. the aim of this paper is to discuss possible horizontal collaboration opportunities in supply chain between bangladeshi industries to impose an impact on the reduction of traffic burden. further, a new comprehensive model named „smart conveyance‟ has been proposed which will not only allow the companies to improve their efficiency but also will play a significant role in reducing traffic congestion.",logistics,"To conclude, horizontal collaboration is a basic need now for the industries all around the country for their own existence. It brings many advantages for the industries like reduced transportation cost, less transport emissions which may lead to Greener Transport Modes. The biggest impact is less traffic clogging during peak hours. Moreover, horizontal collaboration holds promise of far larger efficiency and sustainability improvements. So it is proposed that the industries should collaborate with each other and simultaneously consider appropriate performance measures, integrated policies as well as information sharing to make a win-win situation for all parties, The main objective of this study was to identify the possible solution to design a system that will affect the efficiency of performance of supply chain collaboration of Bangladeshi industries and reduce traffic burden. It has demonstrated possible approaches that can improve logistics performance. This paper was concerned with finding a framework for developments of possible collaborative model within supply chain partners for Bangladeshi industries. The study developed in this paper has the potential to have significant managerial implications.

261,Governance Arrangements For Agile Projects  Kwete Mwana Nyandongo And Khanya Khanyile,"organisations find themselves in a rapidly changing business environment where their success and sustainability depend largely on their ability to respond to these changes timeously and effectively. given that traditional project delivery elongated the time to respond to these rapid changes, organisations are opting for agile methodologies to deliver projects in order to keep abreast of changes. agile project management allow for greater focus on business value, getting continuous feedback from customers and reducing release times. the processes are flexible and allows changes to be adapted if the customers or business needs are not met. however, this approach poses its own challenges when it comes to governing project delivery. it require control, responsibility and accountability. the study seek to answer the question of what governance mechanism should be used in agile project environment to ensure responsibility and accountability toward the project outcome. from a quantitative perspective, a survey was used to gather data from key role players in the agile project environment, and they were analysed using descriptive statistics. while agile software project delivery is a growing trend to deliver projects, it still poses many challenges to various business stakeholders in measuring the value derived. the study has proposed a conceptual framework for governance of agile projects.",,that agile methodologies have brought about an appreciated change in the industry. The issues that are still experienced need to be researched and find ways to reduce their occurrence. A well-defined governance framework will ensure good governance for organisations. 1498,"college of business and economics university of johannesburg johannesburg, south africa kweten@uj.ac.za, 920401735@student.uj.ac.za,","References

262,Assessing The Use Of Project Management Information  Systems And Its Impact On Project Outcome,"a project management information system is generally a single or a collection of computerized software applications that provide easier, efficient, and integrated methods for managing project information from their inception through to their completion. many free project management information systems tools are available for use by project management professionals; however, they do not provide enough support methods to project management. most of these tools can be useful in managing small projects, with short duration, low budget and simple implementation processes. when the project is broad and diverse, sophisticated tool(s) such as ms project or primavera are required. these tools are more expensive; they require skilled project team members and support a single project methodology. in this paper, we assess the use of project management information systems in projects and its impact on the project outcome. project management information systems vendors may use this as a guideline to indicate the key things that organization expects from the tool and to address the shortcomings that exist in their tool. organizations may use the results as guideline in selecting the best set of project management information system tools that would enable success.","pmis, project outcome",PMIS must provide reliable and accurate information that will enable the project team to perform their tasks efficiently and effectively. It is not the complexity of the software that matters but the quality of the information generated by the system and the ability of the user to use the information to manage the project. This information helps the users/ project managers to perform their tasks in a much professional manner. It is recommended that organizations should adopt the use of PMIS in the management of their projects. PMIS guarantees better management of project since it generates quality information needed for the management of the project. 1510,"kwete mwana nyandongo and jabulani lubisi department of applied information systems college of business and economics university of johannesburg south africa kweten@uj.ac.za, 200578729@student.uj.ac.za","REFERENCES

These projects aim to reduce costs, maximize productivity, spread the organizational culture in all its aspects, management, leadership, and in ensuring the permanence of the organization in the market. All these concepts were applied to the branch of Chemical Engineering in the development of the mercury decontamination project in the water with orange peels, resulting in a project with positive results and impact in the two areas, respectively, industrial engineering and chemical engineering. 1519","nancy lucero tapia ruíz, jacobo tijerina aguilera, daniel ulises moreno-sánchez, josué francisco xavier martínez morales, diego andrés martínez treviño universidad de monterrey san pedro garza garcía, nuevo león, méxico nancy.tapia@udem.edu, jacobo.tijerina@udem.edu, danielu.moreno@udem.edu, josue.martinezm@udem.edu, diego.martinezt@udem.edu arlethe yarí aguilar-villarreal universidad autónoma de nuevo león san nicolás de los garza, nuevo león, méxico arlethe17@gmail.com","References

265,Efficiency Analysis Of Public Primary Schools Using Dea:  The Case Of A Medium-Sized Brazilian City,"in the year 2000 governments of all countries established the so-called millennium development goals of the united nations. among the main objectives of these guidelines is to provide conditions so that each person (child, young or adults) can take advantage of educational opportunities to meet their basic needs. the brazilian indice de desenvolvimento da educacao basica (ideb), index created and calculated biannually by the national institute of educational studies teixeira (inep), shows that the levels of proficiency in portuguese and mathematics is still below the target. recent studies suggest that the shortage of public resources and the disorganization of these features are the causes for the poor performance. this study aims to analyze technical efficiency of primary education schools in the state capital of santa catarina state (with nearly 500 thousand inhabitants), in the south of brazil. for this study, data envelopment analysis models were applied using secondary data obtained from inep. the results show that schools with large numbers of enrolled students tend to have more difficulty managing their human and physical resources, resulting in worse technical and scale scores. finally, management actions are proposed in order to overcome the congestion of resources that causes inefficiency of the municipal schools.",,"The objective of this study was to assess technical and scale efficiency of selected public basic schools from the half- million people city of Florianópolis, in the south of Brazil. For doing so, we have considered data from the 2013 edition of the School Census and Brazil Exam programs. Correlation and clustering analysis have shown two homogeneous groups of schools: small- and large-sized. Substantial differences in resource management could also be observed between the two groups by the different figures of number of students per classroom and the number of computers per student. The most representative variables to the problem were identified by means of the Principal Component Analysis, which was used to perform dimensionality reduction as a pre-processing step prior to the application of the DEA models. The number of teachers and employees, full- and part-time enrolled students composed the set of variables chosen as input and the Basic Education Development Index (IDEB, 2013) was considered as the output of the transformation process. The application of the DEA models have shown that larger schools are the least efficient, from both technical (pure technical efficiency) and scale perspectives. The analysis of congested variables pointed to school size reduction as a way to project schools’ production plans to the efficiency frontier. Having seeing that a reduction in the supply of basic education is unviable in the context of the considered schools, it is then proposed that new schools should be put forward, or that the existing schools should grow in size, but keeping the efficient relation between resources and students present in the small-sized schools. It is then finally suggested that future research could explore difference between money spent with the teachers directly (such as wage and bonus) and with their professional qualification (training, career plans). Familiar environment impact on student performance could be also an interesting venue of future research. 1530","carlos ernani fries, lucas bonomini de luna, and ricardo giglio department of production and systems engineering federal university of santa catarina campus trindade, c.p. 476, florianópolis, sc 88040-900, brazil carlos.fries@ufsc.br, lbllucas@gmail.com, ricardo.giglio@ufsc.br,","References

266,Greenhouse Gas (Ghg) Emissions From Land Transports In  Malaysia: Modelling And Policy Analysis,"transportation sector is important to the economy and its rapid development has contributed significantly to the socioeconomic development of the country. the transportation sector in malaysia accounts for approximately 35% of the total energy consumed nationally and produces nearly 50 million tonne of co2 per year in 2015, second only to electricity power generation. though shares only 0.3% of global ghg (greenhouse gas) emissions, malaysia is second largest per capita ghg emitter among the group of asean countries and the major concern lies in the ever increasing trends. the aim of this work was to perform dynamic quantitative emission analysis of malaysian vehicle fleet until year 2040, primarily on land transports including both passenger and freight transports except train. utilizing a system dynamic approach using powersim studio®, several emission scenarios were modelled in compared to current scenario (baseline model). the baseline model was used to determine carbon dioxide (co2), carbon monoxide (co) and nitrogen oxides (nox) reduction for different policy scenarios in compared to baseline scenario. the complex relationships between the various components in the transport system are reflected in the dynamic model considering the vehicle technology, legislation and drivers’ attitude. this work found that co2 emission in 2040 can be reduced by up to 50%, compared to baseline scenario, without affecting the economy and vehicle demand. carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxides pollution can also be reduced by 75% and 93% respectively with implementation of several policies compared to baseline scenario.","system, dynamic, emission, transportation","Fulfilling Malaysia’s objective to a long-term, sustainable transport sector requires addressing a huge amount of threat to the environment. Transportation sector, as the second largest producer of carbon dioxide emission in Malaysia, it plays as an important key element for resolving this threat. Due to the high rate of passenger car ownership, cars account for about 59% of the overall emissions from transport, while freight is responsible for 27%. Although there are a roughly equal number of cars and motorcycles on the roads, motorcycles account for only 11% of the CO2 emissions from the transportation sector. As the economy continues to develop the rate of energy consumption rises, and corresponding Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions are also increasing, resulting in an almost constant rate of CO2 emissions, making it logical to approach better vehicle management. - 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 Baseline Increase EV Reduce VKT Improve FC Fuel quality Combine Target CO2 emissions (million tonnes) Scenarios 2020 2030 2040 0 1 2 3 4 Baseline Increase EV Reduce VKT Improve FC Fuel quality Combine CO emissions (million tonnes) Scenario 2020 2030 2040 1539","shibli azlan, md. mizanur rahman, hasan mohd faizal, aminuddin saat and mazlan abdul wahid department of thermo fluids school of mechanical engineering universiti teknologi malaysia 81310 utm, johor bahru, malaysia shibli@hidsb.com, mizanur@mail.fkm.utm.my, mfaizal@mail.fkm.utm.my amins@mail.fkm.utm.my, mazlan@mail.fkm.utm.my","References

273,Stock Assessment Using A Dividend Discount Model With  Growth Rate Following A Time Series Pattern,"determination of the theoretical price of a stock using a dividend discount model is done by setting various levels of dividend growth. the problem is what if dividend growth is assumed to follow a time series. in this paper it aims to discuss stock valuation using a fluctuating dividend discount model along with the time series. it is assumed that the expected dividend fluctuate with time series model. to estimate the magnitude the expected dividend was performed using a autoregressive integrated moving average (arima) model. as for determining the theoretical price of the stock is done by using the dividend discount models, which include some level of growth. based on the dividend discount model of stock prices in the period to 1 + n shows the current value of all dividend payments over a period of 2( 1 + n through infinite time).","dividend, arima model","In this paper, stock valuation has been discussed using a dividend discount model with a growth rate following a time series. In the dividend discount approach grows to follow the time series model, dividends will grow or decay fluctuating with changes in time. Analysis of dividend growth follows a time series, including technical analysis that does not pay attention to fundamental factors, because it has been assumed to be reflected in stock prices during the analysis. Analysis of dividend growth following a series of times, has a weakness in the mass of predictions, namely the prediction of dividends for the time farther from the starting point, the greater the deviation.

276,"Graph Algorithm Vertex Coloring  Mochamad Suyudi, Sukono","graph coloring problem is to find the minimal number of colors to color vertex of a graph in such a way that every two vertex linked by an edge have different colors. a vertex coloring algorithm has been presented. as a result of applying vertex coloring algorithm no two vertex are to be allocated in same color if they are adjacent in graph. graph coloring and its generalizations are useful tools in modelling a wide variety of scheduling and assignment problems. keyword: graph coloring, vertex coloring 1. introduction 1.1. vertex coloring the vertex coloring problem is a well-known combinatorial optimization problem in graph theory (jensen, toft, 1994), which is widely used in real life applications like computer register allocation (chaitin, et.all, 1981), air traffic flow management (barnier and brisset, 2002), timetabling (de werra, 1985), scheduling (giaro and kubale, 2009), frequency assignment, and light wavelengths assignment in optical networks (gamst, 1986). a legal vertex coloring of graph g = (v, e), where v(g) is the set of |v | = n vertices and e(g) is the edge set including |e| = m edges, is a function f : v → c from the vertices of the graph g to the color-set c = {c1, c2, . . . , cp} such that f(u) ≠ f(v) for all edges (u, v) ∈ e. that is, a legal vertex coloring of g is assigning one of p distinct colors to each vertex of the graph in such a way that no two endpoints of any edge are given the same colors (suyudi et al., 2018; 2017; 2016). formally, the vertex coloring problem can be either considered as an optimization problem or as a decision problem. the optimization version of the vertex coloring problem is intended to find the smallest number of colors by which the graph can be legally colored, and the decision problem aims at deciding for a given p whether or not the graph is p-colorable, and is called p-coloring problem (suyudi et al., 2018; 2017; 2016). it is a way of coloring the vertices of a graph such that no two adjacent vertex share the same color this is called a vertex coloring (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/graph coloring) 1598",,"The main motive of this paper is to present the new Graph Coloring Algorithm with its space and time complexity, this algorithm can be applied to so many applications based on Graph coloring.

285,Potential For Prim Based Classification: A Literature Review  Rym Nassih,"(12 font) this paper provides a critical review of patient rule induction method (prim) and other bump hunting algorithms and their applications. we also give an overview about interpretability in several key supervised data mining algorithms. this allows for exploring the potential for using prim, with its interpretation capability, as a core technology towards building a highly accurate and interpretable classifier in a mixed data space.","prim, bump hunting","and Guidelines This paper highlights the intense need of interpretability in today’s ML. Indeed, ML have reached a high level of accuracy but still miss the same level of interpretability. Therefore, the numerous data mining algorithms could give different models with a various complexity. After presenting key classification supervised data mining algorithms, we have focused on PRIM, a bump hunting algorithm. Although PRIM presents several advantages, studies in literature have revealed several of its limitations. Researchers have highly participated in improving some PRIM’s shortcomings [29] [30] [31] [33] [34]. Nevertheless, the huge amount of rules provided in high dimensional data still requires both the data analyst and the expert analysis and interaction. Thus, the interpretability relies on decision makers input and interaction. This paper is a first step for us to set the problem of interpretability in PRIM and guides us to future work in the same perspective with the aim of integrating PRIM in a supervised learning context to give rise to interpretable classification models.","amips research team - emi university mohamed v rabat, morocco rymnassih@research.emi.ac.ma abdelaziz berrado amips research team - emi university mohamed v rabat, morocco berrado@emi.ac.ma",

289,"Design, Fabrication And Testing Of A 3D Printer Mohamad Hasan Bin Tasneem And Gamal Talal Amer","conventional manufacturing processes depend on the principle of removal of materials, which involves non-linear materials processing and have waste material left after the manufacturing is completed. however, there was always a desire to manufacture products in such a way that the wastage reduces to zero. the concept of additive manufacturing, in the form of 3d printing, made a breakthrough in this direction and has attracted the attention of researchers, engineers, and entrepreneurs. 3d printing has opened new opportunities in terms of manufacturing possibilities and shifted the manufacturing paradigms. this capstone design project aimed to in-house design, fabricate and test a 3d printer. a design was developed consisting of sets of screws, bldc motors and one cnc controller controlled with mach3 software. our printer uses bldc motors due to significantly higher levels of accuracy and efficiency as compared to the current practice of using stepper motor. moreover, we used ball screws instead of the lead screws as they provide smoother, quieter, and efficient motion. these components make this design a novel one that has potential to compete with other 3d printers. finally, the printer is tested to see if this creative combination can be used to advance this manufacturing process.","design, 3d printer","A 3D printer is designed in this final year project based on FDM process. Initially, four different concepts were generated following a set of design specifications. The final concept was developed through a selection process and combining the good features from others. It had the print bed moving linearly along Y-axis while the print head moves along the other two axes. In detail design calculations, decisions were made to select a component based on design calculations or manufacturing by ourselves in the workshops. Standard parts like motors and controller were selected and bought online. A CNC controller was used to control all movements and the filament feed. Load determination and safety calculations for the housing and the printer structure were done and found to be safe. All the standard parts and fabricated parts were then assembled to build the 3D printer. Finally, a dry run was done to test the complete motion system of the printer. Once the dry run was successful, the printer was finally assembled and then tested by modeling an object on SolidWorks® software and then printing it using our 3D printer. After couple of unsuccessful attempts and error debugging processes, the printer worked excellently to print different products. It was noted that the printer can print simple to moderately complex objects with exact dimensions but for complicated models it needs better nozzle. The surface roughness of the printed objects varies with its complexity. Furthermore, the printer was tested to print the same object multiple times with different colors, and it was found to have an excellent repeatability.

290,Multi-Criteria Decision Approach To Measure Complexity  Level In Supply Chain,"growing trend of market competition and higher customer demands with more preferences are creating a complex scenario within global business environment. today’s greater product variety, shorter product life cycle and lower production costs are pushing companies to look beyond their own boundaries, thereby, creating complexity in the management of the supply chain. supply chain complexity creates uncertainties and disruptions, thereby reducing the performance of the entire supply chain. although dealing with complexity is not easy, various studies have shown that if managed well, it leads to better supply chain performances. to manage complexity, the management should understand the associated complexity drivers and level of supply chain complexity. this research identifies twenty- two complexity drivers of supply chain. further, the study proposes integrated ahp and grey relational analysis to quantify the level of supply chain complexity based on the identified drivers. a case study from a multinational company is illustrated to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method, and the practical implication of the results obtained is discussed. results show that the supply chain complexity level of the case company is low, signifying that there is a huge scope of improvement in the case company in terms of managing complexity. moreover, results show that the case company mainly needs improvement in “internal communication and information sharing,” and “compatibility of sc network” to minimize complexity in their supply chain.",complexity drivers,,"sujan piya1, ahm shamsuzzoha2, mohammad khadem1, mahmoud al-kindi1 1college of engineering, department of mechanical and industrial engineering, sultan qaboos university, muscat, oman 2school of technology and innovation, university of vaasa, vaasa, finland",
291,Material And Energy Wastes Reduction In Steel Production  Through The Application Of Lean Manufacturing Tools,"the iron and steel industry plays a major role in the growth and development of modern societies, and is an intensive consumer of energy. manufacturers facing fierce market competition and increased customer awareness about environmental problems and efficient use of natural resources and energy for sustainability, strive for material, energy, and costs reduction to maintain competitiveness. implementing lean manufacturing methodology is a sound way to achieve this aim. this study investigates the prospective effect of lean practices on improving productivity within a deformed rolled bar steel manufacturing facility. the adopted methodology is data-driven based on various lean and quality tools as value stream mapping (vsm), the 5 whys technique, and pareto analysis. the application of lean tools aid in identifying the major causes of losses and may help in increasing productivity and reducing waste in energy consumption. recommended actions may also contribute in decreasing the stoppage time and the risk of equipment damage. by applying the same approach to the whole production line, additional waste reductions in both material and energy are expected.","lean manufacturing, housing, infrastructure","and Future work Lean manufacturing has been extensively used to identify and eliminate waste in industrial facilities. The application of VSM in conjunction with the 5 whys technique and other quality control techniques may resulted in savings in material and energy in steel plants. The proposed methodology results in identifying the main causes of losses and thus may help in saving 0.56 % of total monthly production from the lost billets as a result of cobbles that occur at one of the most critical locations in the rolling line. Furthermore, a potential saving of 26.9% of natural gas consumption, an increase in production by 7.58%, and a decrease in stoppage time may be achieved. These results obtained by recommended actions between 2 guides only. By applying the same approach to other rolling guides, additional savings are expected. The approach is data-driven, yet no extra data collection is needed, it relies on data collected for production and quality control which is readily available. The future work is to extend the value stream map to account for all types of energy and water consumption.","eman saied, noha m. galal and aziz e. el-sayed arab academy for science, technology, and maritime transport, college of engineering and technology, industrial and management engineering department, 1029 alexandria, egypt eng_emanmohamed@yahoo.com, noha.galal@aast.edu, azizezzat@aast.edu",
292,Ranking Of Technologies For Energy Recovery From  Municipal Solid Waste In Bangladesh Using The Analytic,"energy recovery by appropriate management of solid waste from municipal can be the solution to sustainable waste management as well as providing energy security in bangladesh. however, the choice of appropriate waste to energy technology is a complex and challenging issue as a widespread variety of environmental, economic and social controlling criteria need to be identified and investigated. in this paper an analytic hierarchical process is used to find the most preferable waste to energy technology by evaluating environmental, economic and technical criteria. the technologies considered were anaerobic digestion, gas recovery from landfill and incineration. conducting a qualitative and quantitative assessment a preference ranking is produced which concluded that anaerobic digestion is the preferred technology for bangladesh based on cost, benefit and environmental risk. we believe this study will provide a guideline for waste to energy decision makers in bangladesh alongside with other similar developing countries.",,"Success and sustainability of a waste to energy conversion technology largely depend on the communities economic and social status. This study evaluates and compares three technologies for waste conversion from MSW in Bangladesh. Based on the analysis it can be said, incineration produces similar benefit as landfill gas recovery. But the cost and risk is much higher than anaerobic digestion and landfill gas recovery. This is due to the unsuitability of the waste stream and increase of capital cost and operation cost due to unsuitable socio- economical condition as skilled labor needed to be imported for lacking in Bangladesh. The risk factor is highest due to the lack of environmental regulation. On the other hand, landfill gas recovery requires the least cost but the benefit is fairly low from anaerobic digestion. The risk factor difference between these two bio-thermal method is fairly close because of similar mechanism, but as Bangladesh falls in the tropical region with high precipitation and high water table, landfill poses some threat of water pollution from leaching. Considering all three factor of CBR, anaerobic digestion is the most preferable for Bangladesh with highest benefit and lowest risk. The cost factor is slightly high due to pretreatment requirement of waste segregation. This cost can be reduced by incorporating at source separation of biodegradable and non-bio degradable waste. Thus it can be concluded that anaerobic digestion with source separation will be the best solution for Bangladesh municipal waste management and energy generation from MSW.

294,Handling Mercury (Hg) Waste Through Utilization Of  Lapindo Activated Mud Hcl To Realize Environmentally,"indonesia has not been separated from the problem of remaining washing in the amalgamation process of gold mining which is classified as still containing heavy metals, especially mercury (hg). if the dangerous hg heavy metal is wasted into the environment, it can cause various problems in the environment and especially can threaten human life. disorders caused include lumps, tumors, nerve damage, brain damage, and even death. therefore, it is necessary to handle gold mining waste before being disposed of to eliminate hg content, so that gold mine waste is no longer dangerous for humans or the environment. meanwhile, on the other hand there was a long-standing event which until now and was considered a disaster, namely lapindo mudflow. the purpose of this study was to find out how to reduce the content of heavy metal hg produced from the amalgamation process of gold mining by adding activated sludge by hcl. the activation of the lapindo mud causes the impurity mineral component that cannot function as a binding group of heavy metal ions which leaves a lot of pore in the mud. increasing the number of pores causes the surface area of the touch field of mud which has an active group of silanol. this results in a greater and more effective absorption of hg heavy metal ions. heavy metal ions will be trapped in the pores of the mud which have many active silanol groups. the more silica found on the surface of the touch field, the more heavy metals can be absorbed during the adsorption process. in this study qualitative and quantitative tests were carried out on the effect of using activated sludge from lapindo mud on the binding of active ingredients from heavy metals hg. analysis of qualitative data is done by observing the presence of white deposits formed as a result of the qualitative test. quantitative data analysis is carried out by weighing the white sediment formed. this study was also supported by a sem test to observe the surface morphology of hcl activated sludge material. based on the results of the study, it was found that the greater the concentration of hcl activator, the greater the binding capacity of the sludge to heavy metals hg. according to the results obtained in this study, the best hcl concentration as a lapindo mud activator is 0.4 m. because the activated sludge with this treatment has the best ability to absorb heavy metals hg up to 96,06 %. this is in line with the sem test which shows that lapindo mud which is activated by 0.4 m hcl has a large amount of pore so that it can absorb hg heavy metals.","adsorbtion, activated mud",and Recommendations [HCl] (M) 1712,"friendly gold mining sigit trimayanto, rani kurnianingsih, ade tiyas widyawati, laila rezty hertiwi departement of chemistry state university of surabaya surabaya, indonesia sigittrimayanto@mhs.unesa.ac.id, niranikurnia@gmail.com, adewidyawati@mhs.unesa.ac.id, laila.rezty@gmail.com, dkmaharani@gmail.com","References

Major contribution of this work is a non-technical point of view on problematic in e-Health. Firstly, a process model of communication between patient, doctor and healthcare company for e-Health has been described. E-Health is gaining more and more attention to be a subject of study from security point of view. Quality management now can start continuous improvements to a proposed model. This sets a capability maturity model to a level 3 because this paper defined a process of communication in e-Health. Secondly, this work contains a risk analysis of mentioned model. Risk analysis is based on model that is proposed and together with this, there are three tables that shows how certain risks were assessed. First table is for assessing asset value and threats that can occur. Second table shows a qualitative risk analysis and this table gives foundation to a risk management plan. Risk management plan consists of threats, risks and measures how to manage risks. The possibilities of implementing process management and risk management as an essential element of the E- health concept will be the subject of further research.

The real- world example illustrated that the penalization regression would provide accurate prediction models comparing with its counterparts Poisson regression model. To specify the value of the penalization parameter 𝜆𝜆, we applied the penalized likelihood estimation under the K-fold cross-validation proposed by Goeman (2016). One limitation associated with the application of the cross-validation is the case of a small traffic dataset in which the estimate of the penalization parameter 𝜆𝜆 becomes accurate. One way to overcome this limitation is the usage of the leave-one-out (LOO) cross-validation.","abdelmagid hammuda qatar transportation and traffic safety center (qttsc), qatar university, doha – qatar department of mechanical and industrial engineering, college of engineering, qatar university p.o. box 2713, doha, qatar shaligram pokharel, khalifa n. al-khalifa department of mechanical and industrial engineering college of engineering, qatar university p.o. box 2713, doha, qatar shaligram@qu.edu.qa",
301,Tools And Leadership Qualities For Change Implementation Lukas Vaclavik,the change has been always the most difficult challenge of human race. change is part of life doesn’t matter if the change was to start walking after months toddling when we were a babies or if is it change in a company management style. the question is why change is easier to say then to do. this paper looks in to the challenges associated with the start of change in a company environment and will examine different tools which are available for leading change. other points covered in this paper will be leadership qualities and formulating a vision as those are considered enablers for success.,comparison,"This paper focus on change of management. It examines six change management methodologies which can be used for implementing change. This are Lewin’s 3 steps, Kotter’s 8 steps, McKinsey 7S, ADKAR, Change Acceleration Process Model (CAP) and Oakland’s Framework of Eight. It is defined that choice of methodology depend on the environment in which change is supposed to be implemented since none of the tool is universal. Differences between tool are discussed and downsides highlighted to enable leader choose a tool which fit to situation. The paper continue with implementation of the change from leadership perspective, which start from recognizing need for change and continue with leadership qualities needed to implement the change. The major quality for leader is determined to be ability to listen and communicate with employees to get people on board, since change cannot be made without strong coalition. Kubler Ros change Curve is recommended to be used as it helps the leader to understand what are employees going through. Other visualisation tools which are available for leader are shown to enhance change effort. Last section focus defining core problem and formulation of vision. Good vision need to be easy to communicate between employees and should contain two messages which are core ideology and envisioned future. As it was defined by (Oakland, 2014) that 90% of change efforts are struggling in this stage so do not repeat this mistake.","college of mechanical engineering derby university derby markeaton st, de22 3aw, uk lukas-vaclavik@seznam.cz",
302,Introducing A Measurement Framework To Assess Lean  Readiness Level Within Emergency Departments In Kuwait,"the purpose of this paper is to identify the key quality practices deemed essential for lean system (ls) implementation within emergency departments (eds) and to develop a measurement framework to assess the lean readiness within eds. this study is exploratory in nature; thus, the data obtained is secondary. first, the relevant literature was reviewed; the authors focused on the most recent literature (from 2013 to 2018). the review covers aspects such as lean assessment frameworks, lean critical success factors, lean readiness levels, and articles dealing with lss within hospitals in general, and more precisely, in eds. after analysing the literature, the main constructs were identified and the conceptual framework developed. as a second phase, in order to increase trustworthiness regarding the findings of the main constructs, and thereby enhance the robustness of the assessment framework, an expert panel was approached to validate the authors’ findings and assumptions and to ensure that the constructs represented the main factors to enable the authors to measure the lean readiness levels within eds. a total of 65 experts in lean healthcare were contacted through their hospitals and via linkedin; the experts worked in hospitals in countries such as canada, egypt, germany, india, poland, spain, the uk, and the usa. a total of 28 experts agreed to validate the conceptual model; however, only 17 returned the forms to the authors on time. based on a literature review, several factors have been identified as essential factors for lean implementation within eds. those factors were then validated based on the experts’ opinions. the main factors were grouped into six main constructs: top management and leadership, human resources, patient relations, supplier relations, processes, and continuous improvement. the measurement framework has been developed to enable eds to assess their lean readiness before attempting a lean system. this framework should help in mitigating the lean failures initiatives within eds as it can be used to determine the factors that will enable/hinder the implementation of lss within their eds. the constructs of the framework have been validated by experts in lean healthcare practitioners and educators but have not yet been tested, which prevents the author from declaring it fit for eds. future research could be focused on the validation of the proposed framework presented in this study by using the framework to measure lean readiness within non-lean eds. the proposed framework is the first lean readiness measurement framework that concentrates on eds and one of the few lean readiness assessment frameworks in the healthcare literature.","lean assessment, lean healthcare, lean system",,mohamad alnajem busies administration department gulf university for science and technology alnajem.m@gust.edu.kw,
303,Performance And Evaluation Of Perforated Bamboo As  Reinforcement For Concrete,"steel is one of the major reinforcement materials in concrete. the use of other relatively available, natural, and local construction materials such as perforated bamboo for concrete reinforcement is given high consideration this day because of the high cost and unavailability of steel. in this research, perforated bamboo was evaluated as a reinforcement material in concrete. both perforated and split bamboo were subjected to flexural strength test to characterize their performance as reinforcement material for concrete. another flexural strength test was conducted on a concrete reinforced with steel in order to compare its strength properties with both the perforated and split bamboo. it was observed that the use of perforated bamboo as a reinforcement material in concrete is suitable for minor structural construction projects such as lintel.","addictive, aggregates, concrete","and Recommendation Using the result obtained so far, it can be concluded that split bamboo with concrete and perforated bamboo with two nodes can perform the same function in a minor structure such as lintel, the flexural strength obtained from all the samples increases as the number of days increases. In using this type of materials in reinforcing concrete the structure to be used should be considered, and then the load on it should be minimal. Unreinforced concrete is not recommended for any structural work except for mass concrete where tensile stresses are not significant. In this research, it can be concluded that wet bamboo cannot serve any function because it may decay and be damaged by insects which can lead to voids within the concrete and thereby causing collapse of any structure. According to the above research, the use of perforated bamboo as reinforcement in concrete in a minor structure such as lintel is highly recommended, the use of steel as reinforcement in concrete is the control of the reinforcing concrete in any structural design. As a material resource, bamboo as not receive the mainstream recognition it deserves.

309,Measuring The Effect Of Entrepreneurial Competence And  Social Media Marketing On Small Medium Enterprises’,"small and medium enterprise (sme) is one of the most types of businesses in indonesia. the growth of sme’s continues to increase from year to year which also reduces unemployment and poverty in indonesia. with the development of the internet, this time had made the distance and location do not become an obstacle to do business activities in social media. the purpose of this research is to measure the effect of entrepreneurial competence and social media marketing on sme's competitive advantage at south sulawesi province, indonesia using structural equation modelling approach. population in this research are sme's on south sulawesi province, indonesia. survey research with purposive sampling was employed with 115 respondents. data collected using questionnaire and documentation studies and structural equation modelling (sem) was used to analyze data in this research. the result shows that; (1) entrepreneurial competence has a significant and positive effect on sme’s competitive advantage, (2) social media marketing has a significant and positive effect on sme's competitive advantage, and (3) entrepreneurial competence and social media marketing positively and simultaneously affect sme's competitive advantage at south sulawesi province.",,". Based on the results of the study, it is found that entrepreneurial competencies have a positive and significant influence. The implication of these findings, SME owners must be able to increase individual competencies towards the business they own so that it will make SMEs competitiveness also increase. It is in line with the opinion of Mangkunegara (2005) which states that entrepreneurial competence is a fundamental factor that a person has in doing business that makes it different from other business owners who have the average ability. The ability of entrepreneurial competence is as the ability of entrepreneurs to deal effectively with a difficult situation by feeling the limitations of the business environment and activating internal relationships and resources (Iandoli & Raffa, 2007). Whereas Vijay and Ajay (2011) stated that entrepreneurial competence could make it possible to increase business sustainability and business success. These things will increase the competitiveness of a business that will help make a business have an advantage in business competition. SMEs owner who has entrepreneurial competencies both in marketing, finance, building relationships, and technical competencies will have an advantage in business competition. The results also show that social media marketing has a positive and significant effect. It is in line with the research of Nugroho and Kastaman (2014) which states that the use of social media in marketing activities will increase sales in a business to make a business more competitive in business competition. Maharani Mutia et al. (2012) also support this statement by stating that social media provides a competitive advantage by increasing the bargaining position towards customers. It is following the phenomenon that social media plays a role in marketing for young people who are always in touch with internet-based technology and the use of social media, so people spend more time reading on social media than reading newspapers and things can spread widely through social media. Research findings are also following the study of Gurnelius (2011) which mentions the pillars in social media marketing. Social media marketing really plays important parts in creating a competitive advantage for small and medium enterprises.","competitive advantage: a structural equation modeling approach abdul razak munir department of management, faculty of economics and business, hasanuddin university, makassar, indonesia. arazak.munir@gmail.com jumidah maming department of management, faculty of economics and business, hasanuddin university, makassar, indonesia. jumidah.maming@gmail.com nuraeni kadir department of management, faculty of economics and business, hasanuddin university, makassar, indonesia. nuraeinikadir@gmail.com gunawan bata ilyas stie amkop, makassar, indonesia fadelgun@yahoo.co.id abdul talib bon department of production and operations, university tun hussein onn malaysia, malaysia talibon@gmail.com",
310,Multiple Regression Analysis Of Spiritual Stimulants  Increased Awareness As A Company Employee In,"the life that modern all-round nowadays, making demands and necessities of life that high makes everyone work with each other in an attempt to meet all the necessities of life. these conditions force any individual to attempt in various ways to meet the needs of his life. so sometimes forgotten what exactly is the purpose of actual work for them. such a condition makes the behavior of individuals working in companies being encouraged to seek purely material and forget manners and a sense of family within the company. the company works should be a comfortable and pleasant event turned into a mutually oppress one employee with the other employees, if this situation continues then it becomes unhealthy for the company to growing forward. here it takes a spiritual value for employees in the works so that they are aware of and understand the true meaning of working together with other people and friends in an attempt to advance a healthy company. through spiritual company, employees will feel that their place of work as a house of worship and large family homes each other mutually in hand to achieve the goal and well-being together without sacrificing each other a sense of family.","spiritual awareness, employee","After discussing the results of the analysis, there are several important conclusions need to get attention from the management of the company, i.e.. Emotional quotient, creative quotient, adversity quotient, and spiritual quotient is a unity that can not be separated in to build a kesadarn myself so that every employee can begin to fix all the action ends at the repair passion in working. Four variables on top of each other, intertwined in the lives of employees, especially in the building of community self when someone has the same goals with others in carrying out its work in a company. So the emotional quotient, creative quotient, adversity quotient, and spiritual quotient can be applied gradually in accordance with the changes of time i.e. do the application through the hierarchical approach. After understanding all forms of the above conclusions, there is a suggestions and recommendations should be made within the company i.e.. Improvement and application of the emotional quotient, creative quotient, adversity quotient, and spiritual quotient can not be applied simultaneously, therefore its application must follow by the change of motivation, i.e. changes to welfare improvements, the award, reward, more employee rights are met and provide confidence to employees as individuals who have the ability to work. Need to apply a rule that employees have different services and contributions to the company, therefore it is necessary to appreciate the efforts and contributions of services given to every employee to the company through a particular container capable employees with full sense accepted his consciousness. It is certainly better than nothing at all to do something. Because in the long run will all have benefits which result cannot be measured in material, because this is part of an investment company for the cultivation of the sense of having participated in the long run, until they entered a period of full duty later.","improving morale i putu artaya departement of management, universitas narotama, surabaya, indonesia putu.artaya@narotama.ac.id made kamisutara departement of information technology, universitas narotama, surabaya, indonesia made.kamisutara@narotama.ac.id tubagus purworusmiardi departement of management, universitas narotama, surabaya, indonesia tubagus.purworusmiardi@narotama.ac.id abdul talib bon department of production and operations, university tun hussein onn malaysia, malaysia talibon@gmail.com",
311,"Design, Fabrication And Testing Of A 3D Printer Mohamad Hasan Bin Tasneem And Gamal Talal Amer","conventional manufacturing processes depend on the principle of removal of materials, which involves non-linear materials processing and have waste material left after the manufacturing is completed. however, there was always a desire to manufacture products in such a way that the wastage reduces to zero. the concept of additive manufacturing, in the form of 3d printing, made a breakthrough in this direction and has attracted the attention of researchers, engineers, and entrepreneurs. 3d printing has opened new opportunities in terms of manufacturing possibilities and shifted the manufacturing paradigms. this capstone design project aimed to in-house design, fabricate and test a 3d printer. a design was developed consisting of sets of screws, bldc motors and one cnc controller controlled with mach3 software. our printer uses bldc motors due to significantly higher levels of accuracy and efficiency as compared to the current practice of using stepper motor. moreover, we used ball screws instead of the lead screws as they provide smoother, quieter, and efficient motion. these components make this design a novel one that has potential to compete with other 3d printers. finally, the printer is tested to see if this creative combination can be used to advance this manufacturing process.","design, 3d printer","A 3D printer is designed in this final year project based on FDM process. Initially, four different concepts were generated following a set of design specifications. The final concept was developed through a selection process and combining the good features from others. It had the print bed moving linearly along Y-axis while the print head moves along the other two axes. In detail design calculations, decisions were made to select a component based on design calculations or manufacturing by ourselves in the workshops. Standard parts like motors and controller were selected and bought online. A CNC controller was used to control all movements and the filament feed. Load determination and safety calculations for the housing and the printer structure were done and found to be safe. All the standard parts and fabricated parts were then assembled to build the 3D printer. Finally, a dry run was done to test the complete motion system of the printer. Once the dry run was successful, the printer was finally assembled and then tested by modeling an object on SolidWorks® software and then printing it using our 3D printer. After couple of unsuccessful attempts and error debugging processes, the printer worked excellently to print different products. It was noted that the printer can print simple to moderately complex objects with exact dimensions but for complicated models it needs better nozzle. The surface roughness of the printed objects varies with its complexity. Furthermore, the printer was tested to print the same object multiple times with different colors, and it was found to have an excellent repeatability.

314,Model Of Triple Jump Achievment: The Effect Method  Learning And Motor Skills Youth 18 – 20 Age,"efforts to achievement in triple jump (tj) can be done in the process of providing learning methods. furthermore motor skills are the determinant of the quality and quantity of jumper. the purpose of this study was to find out differences of part method learning (pml) and whole method learning (wml) by involving motor skills (ms) in improving of the tj skills. this research uses a 2 x 2 by level experiment design method. participants (n=89) were male collage students aged 18-20 years category. sampling was carried out by specifically selecting 27% of the highest score and 27% of the lowest score, refers to verducci's theory. hypothesis test results 1)pml is better than the wml around this p-value 0,048<0,05, h0 is rejected. 2) there is an interaction effect fo (lmxms) p-value 0,000<0,05 h0 rejected. 3) pmlms1 is better than wmlms1 on students with high motor skills category p-value 0,0005<0,05 or h0 rejected. 4) pmlms2 better than wmlms2 on students with high ms category p-value 0,34> 0,05 h0 acepted. tj skill that taught with pml is higher than the group that being taught by using wml. the low ms category of the pml are more suitable.","triple jump, motor skills","In the score of learning method treatment effect PML and WML gives a significant difference. Group treatment PMLMS1-WMLMS1 has a different value, and PMLMS1 is better than the WMLS1 for students collage high motor category. mean while in the group treatment PMLMS2-WMLMS2 there is an different value. And PMLMS2 is better than the WMLMS2 for students collage low motor category (hypothesis rejected) Furthermore, the TJ skill that taught with PML is higher than the group that being taught by using WML, this shows that PML is more beneficial than WML. This is because the part method is simpler, making it easier for students to understand the process of the movement in part to part. after teaching the whole method. Complexity of the movement of the basic techniques of high triple jump, the part method makes it easy for students to analyze the basic techniques of triple jump. This is because the triple jump material is arranged in a regular and multilevel manner until the basic technical phase of the prefix to the final basic technique. Whereas in the whole method it is different from the part method which are arranged as a whole and are devided d in part to part.

315,The Role Of Academics’ Organizational Commitments On  Their Extra Role Behavior In Academic Contexts,"the educational environment is in need of finding ways for improving organizational performance. the global academic competitive with the 4.0 era necessitate lecturers whose committed and willing do more to for the organization. organizational commitment and organizational citizenship behavior are two imperative concepts in the organization. this study examined the relationship of the three dimensions of organizational commitment (affective, normative, and continuance commitment) with employees' organizational citizenship behavior in an academic environment. based on the results of the analysis, it revealed that in an educational environment only affective commitment shown to have a direct, strong, and positive correlations with one type of ocb of sportsmanship behavior. this result suggested possible impacts of such behaviour. discussion on limitation of the study and implication for future research were also provided. 1. introduction globalization with emerging 4.0 industries has brought more unpredictable environment in the workplace and drive the organizations to find ways for improving organizational performance. in the academic context, the trends have become part of the reality, such as an increasing motivation for internationalization to cope with the global academic environment (altbach and knight 2007). one of the ways is to enhance the capacities of employees by understanding individuals in the workplace. the ability of an organization to manage its employees and to ensure that it is congruent with the organization’s needs is the key to sustaining the organization’s competitive advantage (maia and bastos 2015; mello 2002). since, an individual’s ability and psychology offer cooperative and initiative driven set of attitudes (bindl and parker 2010; kuehn and al busaidi 2002) and fundamental elements in reaching the twin goals of effective performance and higher quality of working life (william 1999). studies have supported the idea that employees’ attitudes and behaviors are related strongly to performance (decarlo and leigh 1996; jha 2011). thus, it is valuable to identify factors that may influence and contribute to predicting employees’ behaviour at work. accordingly, this study concerned with identifying a high level of organizational commitment and a high level of organizational citizenship behavior; the two conceptions are highly considered as predictive aspects of employees’ work behaviour in a competitive era. 1.1. organizational commitment (oc) the concept of employees’ organizational commitment has been conceptualized in various ways (liou and nyhan 1994; meyer and smith 2000; zangaro 2001). employee commitment is a relative strength of an individual’s identification and involvement with an organization (mowday et al. 1979). one of the prevalent concepts of organizational commitment, which has been applied in a number of organizational studies, e.g. in meyer and smith (2000) and yousef (2000), proposed a multidimensional concept of organizational commitment (allen and meyer 1990). the concept consisted of three distinct types of employees’ attachment to the organization. affective commitment reflects the level of employee’s emotional attachment to, identification with, and involvement in the organization. continuance commitment is related to the employee’ perception about the costs associated with discontinuing employment with the organization. normative commitment refers to a sense of obligation and dedication on the part of the employee to maintain the membership in the organization. this model of commitment is described as ‘commitment, whether an employee wants to, needs to, or should do to remain with an organization’ (zangaro 2001). the differences in motivation lead to engagement in varying types of commitment, so that the outcomes can also be quite diverse (meyer and smith 2000). 2054",,"This study is an exploratory single-case study. It is not a longitudinal study to see the effect of, for example the performance appraisal over time on the employees’ commitment. The instruments used were mainly developed based on western work environments and work behavior, while the sample population in this study was from non- western countries. Consequently, the instruments, perhaps reflect cultural bias. This study used a narrowly defined population, therefore it might be inappropriate to generalize the findings. Despite the limitations mentioned, this study opens several avenues for further research. This study is conducted as an exploratory study, thus there are needs to do a significant amount of work in this area. The first is to conduct research in different workplace settings. More research is also required to explain the cultural background of this sample population to see if there are any differences because of this reason and to explore whether there are cultural factors in the context, method, and results of studies in other university context in other countries.","isnawati osman, andi reni, ria mardiana and andi nur baumassepe hasanuddin university, faculty of economics and business, department of management, makassar, indonesia isna.osman@gmail.com , andirenireni@gmail.com , riamard67@gmail.com , massepe@gmail.com abdul talib bon department of production and operations, university tun hussein onn malaysia, malaysia talibon@gmail.com",

317,Empowerment Community In Buru Regency  M Chairul Basrun Umanailo And Rosita Umanailo,"the purpose of this research is to identify the empowerment community which was held in the buru regency since the year 2005 to 2014. the approach used in this research using methods qualitative with the approach of the description, determination of informants using purposive with consideration of the informants are considered as related parties to achieve the research objectives. this study uses data collection techniques of observation, in-depth interviews and focus group discussions. data analysis technique used to follow the concept of miles, huberman and spradley. the results of the analysis of the data shows during the period 2005-2014 the implementation of empowerment in buru regency has not yet reached the value of the substance is visible of the low level of community understanding of the program overlapping the implementation of the program and the regional center as well as the dependence of the program on the system of budgeting. the results of the formulation of the empowerment model indicates there needs to be changes in the pattern of implementation of the empowerment program, namely the integration of empowerment community programs at the level of structure and operational. hall program become central to the implementation of the program in a top-down and vice versa as well as have channels to avoid the buildup of empowerment programs in the area. thus, the expected empowerment program more flexible to achieve the values of substantial and able to provide a solution to the problem of poverty 1. introduction in the context of regional development, empowerment community is one of the priorities of the buru district government policy in efforts to overcome poverty towards achieving the development vision of buru regency that is “buru regency society forward towards a healthy bupolo, smart, moral, prosperous and independent” (chairul basrun umanailo). as known, alleviation of the poor is one of the priorities for medium and long term development in buru regency. this empowerment community policy is implemented through a variety of programs or activities both funded by the regional revenue and expenditure budget and from various other sources, including the state revenue and expenditure budget buru regency is one of the regions in maluku province with a relatively high poverty rate in the last 5 years (afandi and umanailo). this poverty problem, has directly affected the level of community welfare in buru regency, especially those in the countryside. weak empowerment community in realizing prosperity is one indicator of the problem poverty (solano lara et al.). various empowerment programs carried out by central and regional governments, it is known that it has not been able to answer various problems of poverty. through research that has been done, known from 2005-2014 a number of empowerment community programs have been carried out in buru regency, but there are several problems that directly affect the sustainability of the program such as the target group, sustainability and the impact of the empowerment program. dwi pratiwi kurniawati in a study of empowerment community in the field of economic business find a program that has been implemented by the empowerment community agency of the city of mojokerto especially in the economic business sector covering individual assistance and institutional assistance has not been fully successful, dominance in the implementation by the local government made the program not run optimally (kurniawati et al.). meanwhile, faizatul karimah in his study of the management of village fund allocation in empowerment community showing normatively and administratively the management of village fund allocations is done well, but in substance it still has not touched the true meaning of empowerment (karimah et al.). achievement of indicators of empowerment community in the poor empowerment program hairi firmansyah's research shows that the indicators of empowerment community have not yet been achieved (level and basis of empowerment) (prasetyono et al.) isnan murdiansyah shows several operational problems gerdu-taskin program in malang regency like limited capital, 2070",,"Empowerment Community is a process that aims to change. Empowerment Community is an effort to provide opportunities to the community at the same time the ability to play an active role in the development. One of the positive impact of Empowerment Community program implementation, is the community is able to take responsibility towards their work. of research results and the above discussion can be taken a few conclusions. Buru Regency is one of the areas in Maluku Province with potential natural resources abundant enough accompanied by the strength of local cultural life of community support for the achievement of well-being. From the beginning up to the present already formed a considerable amount of Empowerment Community programmes provide deit her by the central government and the regions as poverty reduction and the improvement of well-being. Empowerment programs based individuals and groups as community development efforts tend to overlap in one region of the implementation, lack of concentration and focus on the process and impact of programs implemented so that happened during this is empowerment in partial form and lack of synchronization and verification of the database or the individual target group. Weak data synchronization and networking opportunites for work program occurred attenuation of programs that have an impact on the target product so the program empowerment more stop on the implementation process and target group. The empowerment model integrates the findings of the implementation model is divided into two parts, institutional and operational basis to ease the process of implementation of the activities and the preparation of various instruments. The empowerment model integrates ease of initiation society to convey the proposals as well as stimulate the creativity of individuals and target groups in the implementation of Empowerment Community. Hall became the center of program implementation of the program that integrates the initiation, the process of implementation to monitoring and reporting the end of Empowerment Community team empowerment of village community became an important pillar for the process of implementation and accompaniment towards individuals or target groups in each village. The main source of initiation is derived from a structured society up to the hall program which are divided into internal initiation and sharing programs against the central government, local government or private parties.

322,How Do Knowledge Management Practices Influence The  Deployment Of Lean Management: A Case Study,"lean has its origin in the toyota production system. aiming to deliver customer value through people’s respect and waste reduction, lean advocates five principles: value specification, value stream identification, flow, pull and perfection. knowledge management, through the process of identifying, capturing and leveraging knowledge, became a source for competitive advantage for organisations. this paper aims a contribution to a better understanding of lean combined with knowledge management (km) tools, through the study of the outcome from lean and km tools adoption in invoice verification process at a portuguese shared services organisation. the study analysed how the execution time of a process depends on the operators who perform it and if operators’ individual practices have an impact on the process execution time. the implementation process was surveyed through observations and statistical analysis, which identified differences in terms of practices used by operators. statistical evidence made it clear that best practices adopted by operators have a positive impact in their execution times. moreover, it was also important to notice that lean and knowledge management combined practices can be useful to organisations in a digital transformation program, which will require standardisation and process automation.","lean, lean management","The study surveyed a finance shared services department through observations based on Lean gemba and waste identification combined with knowledge management tool, storytelling and KM approach internal benchmarketing. These tools were fundamental to identify the different practices adopted among the operators and the wastes in the process procedures. Statistical analysis were made with the support of statistica software, namely One-Way-ANOVA test, which led to the conclusion that the process execution time is dependent on the operator who performs it, producing an effect of approximately 55 % in the variability of the process execution time. Hence, through the Fisher LSD test interception with the practices identified in the gemba and storytelling, it was proved that operators’ individual practices impact their process time performance. Also, the Fisher LSD test allowed to understand where the significant differences among the operators’ execution times were, and cross check with their current practices. Top performers were applying the same practices identified in the gemba and worst performers were not. This validated those practices as good practices, since it was proved they have a positive impact on the process time performance. Moreover, the lean and knowledge management tools allowed the identification of wastes through storytelling and visual analysis of the process procedure and their elimination via communities of practices and peer assistance. In this sense, it was proved that the combination of lean and knowledge management tools can be useful to organisations, such as organisation A, in a digital transformation program, by enabling the required standardisation, process automation and continuous improvement actions. Additionally, the study converged to the organisation knowledge management strategy, “Identification and share of best practices”, and consequently to the organisational business strategy of improving their operational performance. However, for the time being it is not possible to measure those contributions. For future studies it would be interesting to implement the mentoring knowledge management tool. Not only to share the good practices identified among the operators in the gemba, but also to understand the impact of sharing these best practices and to analyse how the log-normal distribution parameters of execution times will react.

325,Model Of Reward System Toward The Performance Of Public  Sector Organizations,"the service quality of public sector organizations in indonesia is currently considered to be less satisfactory than the private sector. one reason for the low performance of public sector employees is because the reward and punishment system is not applied firmly and consistently. the reward system is very important in both the private and public sectors, because rewards have a central role to keep employees motivated and tied to work. the social exchange theory states that when a person is satisfied with the award given by the organization, they will reciprocate by developing a positive attitude towards the organization such as a higher level of commitment. this study aims to explore the effect of reward systems on the commitment and performance of public sector employees using quantitative methods. analysis of research using primary data collected through questionnaires using survey methods and hypothesis testing using pls software. the results showed that :extrinsic rewards negatively affected affective, normative, and sustained commitment; intrinsic and social rewards have a positive effect on affective, normative and sustainable commitment; affective commitment has a positive effect on organizational performance, while normative and sustainable commitments negatively affect organizational performance","service quality, public sector, private sector, reward system","Firstly, the reward system has a major role to keep employees motivated and tied to their work. Employees' positive perception to the organization develops when they feel the organization values their contribution and realizes the rewards in recognition of their hard work and effort. The loosening of the rules of employee management and the weak implementation of rewards and punishments in public sector organizations has led to a lack of satisfactory public service performance. When the public demand for excellent service and competition with the private sector in the supply of public goods is increasing, various policies such as bureaucracy reform, formation of Public Service Agencies (BLU), remuneration systems, etc. are applied. However, nowadays, these policies still have not produced maximum output yet. Referring to the Social Exchange Theory, the reason someone is involved in an exchange relationship with another person because of the relationship will be rewarded. Social exchange theory discerns between behavior and environment as reciprocal relationships. Some studies say that monetary rewards are considered the most effective way to increase employee commitment and performance, but the fact shows that the increase in monetary rewards has not been able to optimally improve the performance of public sector employees, such as: remuneration, salaries 13 and 14, educator certification etc. The results of this study are different from the results of previous studies which stated that extrinsic rewards have a positive effect on organizational commitment and performance. It shows that extrinsic rewards are not always able to improve employee performance because: first, referring to Crowding Theory that in certain conditions extrinsic reward actually weakens intrinsic motivation. Providing monetary rewards only increases performance within a certain time. When employees receive an increase in external rewards it will be followed by consumptive activity. This activity causes satisfaction with external rewards to last only for a while, then employees will try to seek additional rewards from other sources (there is a decrease in commitment); extrinsic reward expectations cause a person to behave as desired if there is a reward given. This effect is called The Hidden Cost of Reward. Secondly, social exchange theory sees there are reciprocal relationships between behavior and the environment; when the employee management system has not been implemented optimally in which there are still unfair procedures in the process of promotion, the impact on employee commitment is even given an increase in external reward. The study proves that the basic principle of social exchange is a ""distributive justice"" rule saying that a reward must be proportional to investment not always valid; but it is precisely procedural justice that perpetuates an exchange relationship. Lastly, pointing at the characteristics of respondents in which 81% had undergraduate education and 50% of respondents had worked more than 20 years, the need for intrinsic and social rewards is greater than the need for external reward. Even if there is an increase in external rewards, it will still have a negative impact on employee commitment and performance when the type of work they accomplish is below their competence,. This is reflected in the last main function and position of each public sector job is to carry out duties in accordance with the orders of superiors. This rule requires employees to do whatever the boss instructs, even if it has nothing to do with official duties, ultimately creating employee dissatisfaction.","dewi prastiwi, pujiono and aisyaturrahmi universitas negeri surabaya, department of accounting, surabaya, jawa timur 60231, indonesia dewiprastiwi@unesa.ac.id abdul talib bon department of production and operations, university tun hussein onn malaysia, malaysia talibon@gmail.com",
326,Factors Affecting Poverty In Lamongan  Dwi Suhartini And Astrini Aning Widoretno,"poverty is a fairly complex problem at the regional and national levels, so the government must have the right and sustainable strategy in handling it. indonesia is a country in the category of developing countries and has problems in terms of poverty. education, mses, population growth, unemployment, economic growth are factors that trigger problems in poverty alleviation. lamongan regency is included in the 10 regencies / cities in east java province with the largest percentage of poor people with a percentage of 14.42% in 2017. the aim of the study was to examine and analyze the influence of educational factors, mses, population growth, unemployment on poverty levels directly or indirectly through economic growth. the analysis technique uses path analysis with data from 2002 to 2017. the results of the study show that the lamongan regency government has a commitment to improve education, mse and economic growth. however, it is not optimal in dealing with population growth, unemployment and poverty levels. there are a number of constraints, including the measurement of poverty that is not uniform among related institutions. in addition, social and cultural factors have not been optimally considered.","education, economic growth, unemployment","The results of this study provide some conclusions, such as the high level of education in Lamongan Regency has not been followed by economic growth, because the availability of employment in a broad area is still limited so there are still many open unemployment rates. People who do not work cannot fulfill their consumption, so economic growth is low. At present, Lamongan Regency is ranked as the top 10 in the poorest City District in East Java. However, there has been an increase in the number of MSEs which has triggered a fairly good rate of economic growth. The population growth in Lamongan Regency has not had a direct effect on the level of economic growth, while the unemployment rate in Lamongan Regency has encouraged high rates of economic growth. This phenomenon gives the idea that economic growth is not triggered by people's consumption needs derived from their income. On the other hand, higher levels of education have an impact on the decline in poverty rates through high economic growth. In addition, there is an increase in MSEs which will reduce poverty through improving economic growth. There is something interesting when the population growth rate increases, the poverty rate also increases through increasing economic growth. This indicates that the consumption needs of the community are not spent on income from work but from income as migrant workers and migrant workers or from government grants. In addition, there is a tendency to measure the level of economic growth that is less valid and the measurement of non-uniform poverty rates between institutions that empower communities. The Lamongan Regency Government must continue to improve job training programs that are competitive and certified to produce a workforce that is superior in terms of education and expertise so that it has high competitiveness. In addition, it must always improve monitoring and evaluation of all community empowerment programs that are rolled out to the community. This is done to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of community empowerment programs, so that the poverty rate in Lamongan Regency can be reduced optimally and provide effective education to the people of Lamongan District so that the programs rolled out are more useful in alleviating poverty. There must be uniformity in measuring poverty levels between related institutions.","upn “veteran” jawa timur, department of accounting, jalan raya gunung anyar, surabaya, indonesia suhartinidwi7@gmail.com , astrini.widoretno.ak@upnjatim.ac.id betty silfia ayu utami islamic state sunan ampel university, department of economics, jalan ahmad yani no.117, surabaya, indonesia bettysilfia10@gmail.com agus sukoco narotama university, department of management, jalan ar hakim 51, surabaya, indonesia sri wiwoho mudjanarko narotama university, department of civil enginerring, jalan ar hakim 51, surabaya, indonesia abdul talib bon department of production and operations, university tun hussein onn malaysia, malaysia talibon@gmail.com",

LMS uses Moodle 3.3 software. The developed e-assessment has been validated by the expert and declared eligible to be used for the evaluation of physics learning. Questions in the e-assessment model can be made in a variety of forms such as multiple choice, essay, and another form. At the testing stage, the number of questions on each display influenced the participant's focus in answering. The random and different question between the students made them more focused on answering independently than conventional tests with almost identical order and type questions. The time limit in working on the question made the student more disciplined and used the time wisely. Quick feedback and follow-up recommendations help the student to know the weakness during the test so they will prepare for the next test. During the study, there were no significant obstacles due to adequate internet access, an easy feature for students. However, this should be maintained in subsequent research. Another thing that should be controlled during the test is that students do not open a new tab for internet access on other sites.

The devices available in Orai help the students to study individually and in group. They can learn within in the classroom or out the class room. By the assistance of media the students enjoyed their lessons more and were more motivated, interested and confident during the teaching- learning sessions. Therefore, the CLL method should be applied in activities designed for teaching-learning EFL speaking. It is recommended that the CLL method should be extended for teaching-learning other language skills, such as reading, phonology, conversation skills, interpreting, and drama. Yet, Orai has some weaknesses. It relays much on the availability of internet connection and costly. It also not able to give any suggestion related on the grammatical error. For these weaknesses it is suggested that the institution should provode the sufficient facilities for the successful of teaching and learning.

331,Islamic Social Reporting Disclosure And Firm Value:  Empirical Study Of Firms Listed In Jakarta Islamic Index,"this study explains the influence of company size, profitability, environmental performance on firm value through islamic social reporting (isr) disclosure. the research is research explanatory which used secondary data listed companies at jakarta islamic index (jii) by 2013 – 2017. the research results show that the size has positive effects not significant toward islamic social reporting (isr) disclosure. the size of the company also directly influence positively but not significantly to firm value, insignificant effect mediation through islamic social reporting (isr) disclosure. profitability has a negative significant toward islamic social reporting (isr) disclosure and firm value positive insignificant effect mediation through islamic social reporting (isr) disclosure. environmental performance has a positive significant impact on isr disclosure and firm value but has no significant effect through isr disclosure. this study also found that the influence of isr disclosure has a positive insignificant effect on firm value.",,"Firm size has a positive but not significant effect on ISR disclosure. This indicates that the size of the company proxied through the company's total assets does not affect the level of corporate ISR disclosure registered in JII for the 2013-2017 period. Profitability has a negative and significant effect on ISR disclosure. This indicates that the higher the profitability value proxied through the company's Return on Assets (ROA), it will result in a decrease in the level of corporate ISR disclosures listed in the JII for the 2013-2017 period. Environmental performance has a positive and significant effect on ISR disclosure. This indicates that the better the company's environmental performance, the higher the ISR disclosure of companies listed in the JII 2013-2017. The size of the company has a direct positive effect but not significant on the value of the company, and has no significant effect through ISR disclosure. This indicates that the size of the company does not affect the level of ISR disclosure, and indirectly also does not affect the value of the company. Or in other words, ISR disclosure is not able to mediate the relationship of company size to firm value. Profitability has a direct and significant negative effect on the value of the company, but has no significant effect through ISR disclosure. This indicates that profitability affects the level of ISR disclosure, but indirectly does not affect the value of the company. Or in other words, ISR disclosure is not able to mediate the relationship of profitability to the firm value. Environmental performance directly and positively influences the value of the company, but has no significant effect through ISR disclosure. This indicates that environmental performance affects the level of ISR disclosure, but indirectly does not affect the value of the company. Or in other words, ISR disclosure is not able to mediate the relationship between environmental performance and firm value. ISR disclosure has a positive but not significant effect on the value of the company. This indicates that the high or low level of corporate ISR disclosure does not affect the value of the companies listed on the JII 2013-2017 period.","mursalim nohong, muhammad sobarsyah and abdullah sanusi hasanuddin university, department of management, makassar, sulawesi selatan 90245, indonesia mursalimnohong@fe.unhas.ac.id sartika handayani k universitas fajar, department of management, makassar sulawesi selatan 90231, indonesia narto irawan otoluwa universitas muslim maros, department of management, maros, sulawesi selatan 90512 abdul talib bon department of production and operations, university tun hussein onn malaysia, malaysia talibon@gmail.com",
