1,Robust Least Squares Estimation Model For   Fighting Poverty In Indonesia Case,"lack of electricity and high dropout rates create conditions of poverty everywhere in indonesia. poverty becomes a very complex problem that has broad impacts. poverty destroys purchasing power, decreases human quality, and decreases economic welfare. lately, efforts to fulfill electricity and basic education have become crucial because electricity can be used in a variety of activities and education will open views to improve the situation individually and socially. therefore, the econometrics model in this study is the effect of electricity and basic education on poverty in the indonesian territory. this study uses secondary data cross section as many as 501 districts and cities in indonesia. the analytical method in this study is robust least squared model. the results of the analysis of this study conclude that an increase in electricity and the level of participation in primary school education can significantly reduce poverty. every 1% increase in household access to electricity will reduce the poverty gap index by 0.058, then each increase in participation primary school education will reduce the poverty gap index by 0.067. this study suggests that the policy of fulfilling electricity and basic education is crucial to combating poverty in regions in indonesia.",electricity,"It turns out that the combination of fulfilling education and electricity can reduce poverty gap powerfully. Between electricity and education support each other and in the same direction to reduce poverty gap. The National Development Strategy of these two basic needs is the key to success for the Indonesian state. Policies that support the fulfillment of electricity and cheap education for the community are absolute. Indonesia Government is going to push electricity energy. Government had to build some electricity power station in all Indonesia region. Also government do program for placing teacher in all region. This is important because this policy strategy has a dual effect not only for reducing poverty inequality but also for social welfare across districts and cities. Thus, it has been proven that the need for education and meeting electricity does not only improve the economic conditions of the community but also reduce the poverty gap.","sidik budiono department of management faculty of economics and business universitas pelita harapan, tangerang-15811, indonesia sidik.budiono@uph.edu john tampil purba department of management faculty of economics and business universitas pelita harapan, tangerang-15811, indonesia john.purba@uph.edu gidion p. adirinekso department of management faculty economics and business universitas kristen krida wacana, jakarta, 11470 indonesia gidion.adirinekso@ukrida.ac.id",
2,A Literature Review On Coal Gasification As Part Transition  In Sa Thermal Coal Power Generation,"south africa uses direct combustion of coal for its bulk power generation. the air emissions of noxious gases which includes carbon emissions is a continuous challenge. south african power stations have historically employed best practices for managing air emissions. south africa has also pioneered the coal to gas to liquid technology in the production of synfuels; sasol. south africa is in need for a just transition away from direct coal combustion. this paper explores the theory and global practices of coal gasification, reviews the recent research efforts on advances in the processes and questions if the approach could be a partial contribution towards a just transition in south africa’s bulk power generation. the south african economy is a coal driven economy and every engineering contribution that includes the management and use of this natural resource has merit. in conclusion, the paper explores the idea of introducing the required heat for gasification from a small modular nuclear reactor; to go one step ahead in terms of introducing the emerging hydrogen economy whilst unfccc puts to rest the old coal economy by 2050.","coal gasification, syngas, air emissions","The application of coal gasification technology is mature and commercial. The literature review study draws the following conclusions: i. The use of synthetic gas in power generation increases the efficiency of the system, is eco- friendly, and is a better substitute for coal combustion in thermal power stations. ii. The thermal efficiency of an integrated gasification combined cycle plant is relatively higher than that of a coal combusting power plant iii. Coal gasification technology is compatible with machinery and equipment currently used in coal combusting facilities in South Africa. iv. Technical advancement and carbon capture technology enable coal gasification plants to produce much less carbon emissions. Towards the future, The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change has aspiration that post 2050, coal will cease as a primary energy resource for mankind. South Africa has three decades to migrate away from carbon energy resources such as coal, oil and gas. To make the transition from carbon to non-carbon resources over three decades, an option is to consider syngas from coal. Syngas has the attributes of localization for energy independence and the capacity and capability for energy security. Adding in a small modular nuclear reactor as heat source, mitigates using coal combustion for heating and will start a new economy in industrialization, promoting both nuclear and hydrogen engineering and technology. When all is done and coal is removed as primary energy resource, South Africa will have accumulated strength in both nuclear and hydrogen energy resources. The South African Energy Transition Pathway could read : Coal combustion to coal gasification; Towards a nuclear and hydrogen energy economy which is complimented by solar and wind renewables with pumped hydroelectricity energy storage, having present day demand of 35 GW with a potential 70 to 80 GW demand in 2050. The key research questions remain: a. Can coal gasification using the heat from a small modular nuclear reactor be an economically viable strategy in moving from 100 % coal combustion to zero coal combustion by 2050, to leave behind a new economy in nuclear and hydrogen engineering, technology as sustainable non- carbon energy resources ? b. Can nuclear and hydrogen energy resources compliment and associate with renewable energy resources, including using municipal solid and sanitation waste as primary hydrogen feedstock post coal? c. Can the UNFCCC Global Climate Change Fund, finance a new coal gasification investment in Mpumalanga (similar to Sasol) that will have a 2 decade life span (2030 to 2050) in powering the existing South African Thermal Power Stations, a potential 40 GW stranded national asset?

3,Understanding South Africa’S Independent Power Producer  Programme,"energy is central to national economic growth and prosperity. in 2003, south africa published its white paper on independent power procurement as a first step in market liberalization. to date, south africa has procured via ministerial determinations, mostly from on shore wind and solar photovoltaic, renewable energy to compliment the national power utility baseload of thermal coal, imported hydro and nuclear. the new investments in renewable energy was substantial, r200b as compared to eskom’s new build of medupi, kusile and ingula of r400b; all being sovereign guaranteed. the paper analyses the utility scale renewable energy investments since inception. the conclusion is that the future of renewable energy resources will be limited to only wind and solar photovoltaic technologies. these will most likely be developed in just three provinces of south africa as a complimentary energy resource to the national grid. they will have no role in national energy security. given the demise of coal as the vanguard of national energy security, the accountability transfers to nuclear. a new era of the 4th industrial revolution of advanced manufacturing and industrialization will emerge. the private sector led auction and bid financing as developed in the ipp program is a strength worthy of transfer to the new nuclear national investment programme.",wind energy,"4.1 Renewable Energy Resource of Wind and Solar Photovoltaic Utility scale investments of wind and solar PV will most likely be limited to the existing favorable sites as in the Eastern, Western and Northern Cape provinces of South Africa. These three provinces have potential to exceed the next decade plans of 17,742 GW and 8,288 GW as at 2030; however, national grid absorption capacity and the absence of large scale static energy storage solutions could emerge as the bottleneck to investments. For the three major economically active provinces of Gauteng, KwaZulu Natal and Mpumalanga Provinces, a confident forecast is zero investments in large scale wind or solar photovoltaic technologies. These three economically active provinces just do not have the natural resources to power up the large scale wind or solar multi billion rand investments. The remaining three provinces of Limpopo, North West and Free State could attract just smaller size solar photovoltaic investments and no investments in wind. The past trend (2012 to 2020) and the forecast trend (2020 to 2030) is that the multi billion rand renewable investments will be localized to just the three provinces and will not be distributed nationally across the South African National Grid.

5,"Development Of An Asset Criticality Assessment Tool, The  Case Of A Fertiliser Manufacturing Company",the adaptability of asset management plan to changes in production models is needed to improve competitiveness. this research outline a design of a criticality assessment tool with particular emphasis to a fertiliser manufacturing company. the criticality assessment tool was developed as a framework based on the analytical hierarchical process (ahp) which was used in the design of a computer application. the assessment tool was applied at the company producing criticality scores and ranking for assets which had been presented in two hierarchical levels namely system and sub-system 12 system level assets and 142 sub system level assets). the results produced by the assessment tool where consistent with the perceived top 10 critical assets as determined by 24 subject matter experts (sme) within the organization. the results allowed the company to priorities its critical assets and come up with strategies for each asset which was previously difficult to achieve. the tool enable the prioritization of assets in line with the business objective as stipulated in the asset management system standard (iso 55001).,"asset criticality, iso 55001","The question “How can asset criticality assessment be done effectively for a fertilizer manufacturing plant?” has been answered by saying, one can use AHP a Multi Attribute Method, while leveraging on a methodology that first determines the contextual interpretation of identified single matter experts (SME) in a setup (organization) and applying the interpretation in determining the appropriate decision making criteria for determining quantified asset criticality. The quantified asset criticality can be used as an integral part of the assent management system detailed in ISO 55001.","milton masukume, samson mhlanga, tinashe mubvirwi department of industrial and manufacturing engineering national university of science and technology po box ac 939, ascot, bulawayo, zimbabwe mmasukume@gmail.com, smhlanga126@gmail.com, tbmubvirwi@gmail.com tawanda mushiri industrial and mechatronics engineering department, faculty of engineering and the built environment, university of zimbabwe 630 churchill avenue, harare, zimbabwe tawanda.mushiri@gmail.com",
6,Analysis Of A Rectangular Actiflo Clarifier Under  Hydrostatic Pressure Via Fea,"as the south african population grows, so too is the demand for clean water. there are numerous methods that have been developed over the years for cleaning water. water purification technologies at veolia water technologies, in johannesburg, south africa, is focused on increasing the quality of purifying water systems. however, challenges of building bigger clarifying systems to accommodate for demand is key. in this paper, a structural control system on an existing clarifier is developed and tested in ansys. this led to the identification of the number of stiffeners needed to support a 4m high rectangular tank, however, the number of stiffeners required for a tank of much larger size is still unknown. various parameters such as fatigue failure, design variables, as well as the different stiffener positions and sections used to determine the local bucking points of the rectangular structure is tested in the fea environment using ansys. this allowed for the examination of the actiflo’s behaviour using several stiffener configurations while simultaneously reducing the thickness of the structure in order to reduce costs. the effects of loads on deflections and stresses on the actiflo are found to be pronounced around stiffener locations and local buckling points. building on this a new model of a much larger actiflo clarifier is being proposed in this paper.","actiflo, stiffener, buckling, fatigue failure, hydrostatic forces","The aim of this project was to effectively investigate methods of optimizing the Actiflos stiffeners. This could not be done without thorough research of how parameters such as the Actiflo wall thickness, stiffener configurations used, optimal stiffener locations as well as identifying local buckling points. The Actiflo was designed in accordance to the volume required per chamber which covers the most important aspect of an Actiflo operation however no structural analysis was done to investigate the number of stiffeners required to resist the internal hydrostatic forces, the type of stiffeners to be used and ideal locations to place stiffeners. This structure was therefore classified as statically indeterminate beam with a VDL (varying distributed load). The simulation power tool is found compatible for this investigation as it can effectively solve complex problems and any risks by identifying failures prematurely before they occur, this may also cut any manufacturing costs. A second benefit to this application is it increases robustness and reliability of a structure. A baseline model was created without use of stiffeners, to determine the threshold of the plate’s deflection. Upon review of the two main factors namely, costing and simulation of the configuration. Configuration 1 is the cheapest but proves the least effective. Configuration 2 is also cheap option as well but does not maintain the structural shape. Deformation is still apparent. Finally, Configuration 3 proves the best option as the saving is drastic as well as the rigidity in comparison to the other two configurations (Maqina, 2021).

7,Investigating The Optimal Stiffener Locations Of An Actiflo  Clarifier Under Hydrostatic Pressure,"an actiflo clarifier is a water purification system designed by veolia water solutions in johannesburg, south africa, to handle 10 ml of water a day. the tank is relatively large and made using thin plates reinforcement with stiffeners. for the current design, it is found that the plate thickness can be reduced considerable by adding horizontal or vertical stiffeners or a combination of both. the addition of stiffeners will increase the rigidity of the tank wall by increasing the moment of inertia of the combined section. for the design of tank walls with intermediate horizontal stiffeners, there is no simple formula available. this research is focused on investigating the optimal stiffeners locations, in attempt to reduce costs without compromising on the structural integrity. specifically the investigation focused on investigating the optimal stiffener locations using the 200 x 75mm parallel flange. the robustness was tested by developing a conceptual design on autocad inventor and conducting simulations of varying distributed load on a beam (i.e the actiflo wall) with multiple supports (stiffeners)","actiflo, stiffener, autocad, moment of inertia, hydrostatic forces","The aim of this project was to effectively investigate methods of obtaining optimal stiffener locations of the Actiflo Clarifier. This could not be done without thorough research of how parameters such as the Actiflo wall thickness, stiffener configurations used, optimal stiffener locations as well as identifying local buckling points (Maqina, 2021). The Actiflo was designed in accordance to the volume required per chamber which covers the most important aspect of an Actiflo operation however no structural analysis was done to investigate the number of stiffeners required to resist the internal hydrostatic forces, the type of stiffeners to be used and ideal locations to place stiffeners. This structure was therefore classified as statically indeterminate beam with a VDL (varying distributed load). Therefore an effective approach to solve such a problem was to make substantiated assumptions and limit the number of variables analyzed. The calculated results had 1% error due to human error, the simulations are more accurate, and however for more accurate results it is essential to provide the software with more inputs (Maqina, 2021). The simulation power tool is found compatible for this investigation as it can effectively solve complex problems and any risks by identifying failures prematurely before they occur, this may also cut any manufacturing costs. A second benefit to this application is it increases robustness and reliability of a structure.

8,An Appraisal Of Innovative Approach To Plastic Waste  Disposal Using Recycling Technique In Nigeria,"plastic waste in nigeria has undeniably been a leading source of pollution since the inception and use of plastic for packaging food and beverages. the rapid increase in its production and usage has become of significant concern and has contributed to the problem of waste disposal. its effects cannot be overemphasized considering its environmental hazards such as clogging of water ways, release of chemicals into the soil, endangerment to animals living in and around water bodies. it has become imperative that proper actions be taken to manage plastic waste disposal. the approaches considered in this paper are mostly circled around innovative recycling technique. descriptive statistics was employed in analyzing the data and hypotheses were tested using chi-square test. the analysis of the result shows that there exists poor management practice on plastic disposal and reveals that the perceptions of male and female respondents to sustainable plastic waste disposal management differs. the findings of this study concluded that this paper looks into certain methods that are already being implemented to manage plastic waste in nigeria as well as the approaches that may be more effective in ensuring proper disposal so as to maintain environmental sustainability.","plastic waste, recycling, sustainability",,"a research work by the research and development team of sustainable green environment (sge) initiative research@sgeinitiative.org, admin@sgeinitiative.org olowosile j. sanmi (chairman) sanmijossy@sgeinitiative.org olowosile o. ruth (executive director) rolowosile@sgeinitiative.org adeleke e. olubunmi (research team lead) lekebunmi@gmail.com odiase e. titus (researcher) titusodiase59@gmail.com adedokun a. victoria (researcher) victoriaabimbola28@gmail.com ogunsola a. oluwatosin (researcher) oluwatosinogunsola8@gmail.com makinwa olusegun (researcher) makinwaolusegun@gmail.com orisabinone toluwalase (researcher) orisa1234tolu@gmail.com",
9,Simulation Of An Acoustic Device For Online  Cleaning Of Boilers At Sasol Synfuels Power,"this paper assesses the acoustics technology as a possible solution to online cleaning of coal fired boilers. an acoustics device is designed in autocad invertor professional 2016, where simulations are performed and compared with calculations done to determining if the acoustic device can be used for boiler cleaning or as a backup system to soot blowers, popularly used in south africa. the similarity law was used to determine the frequency of the beam that will be suitable for an acoustic horn with a frequency of 75hz when varying forces ranging from 40n to 820n are used. the diaphragm of the acoustic horn deflected 0.5 mm when a pressure of 552kpa was applied. it was further found that for as long as the diaphragm does not deflect and bleed the air the stress needed will be 816 mpa which will not reach the expected maximum. this will make the acoustic horn experience a pressure of 50mpa which is able to dislodge soot on the tube walls and surfaces of the boiler. this paper also looks at material and their properties which are used for the beam and acoustic horn.","sasol, power plants, boilers, design, acoustics","The material that was selected was appropriate for the project as cast-iron beams today are used in boilers. The cast iron beam, even though it is a brittle material, can still withstand high temperatures and a considerably high amount of vibration before fracturing. Brittle material was chosen because under high temperature ductile material will tend to expand drastically before fracturing and that is not good for the flow of water and fire moving through the tubes. The location of the stress in the simulation was correct as the stress was maximum where the force was applied. The maximum stress of 182.088MPa and a maximum deflection of 26.2866mm for the simulated values and with direct calculating of stress we get a max stress of 224.06MPa and deflection of 48.088mm. This deflection is enough to remove the slag and soot off the beams. The best force was found to be 225N which gave a max stress of 61.1562MPa and deflection 9.24mm. Based on the results obtained from the simulation and calculation, the applied force increases deflection as the stress approaches fracture (Shandu et al, 2019). However, the graphs and calculations showed that the maximum safe stress is 225N but can withstand values above this frequency.

10,Cost Analysis Of Soot Blower Use For Boiler Maintenance At  Sasol Secunda,"this paper presents cost analysis for maintenance in the steam plant department of sasol in secunda, south africa, based on weekly boiler outage and general boiler breakdowns. all maintenance and contributing factors during a general overhaul (go) for a period of 48 months maintenance plan are carefully analyzed in this paper. the current cleaning technology which uses soot blowers was found to be the main contributor to the high costs due to its failure when the boiler is running, causing leaks and erosion on boiler tubes. as a result, there is a significantly high cost on superheater tubes with a variance of r29 704 191.18 from a budget of r50 919 502.53 in 14 days of a 90 days go. the cost of soot blower repairs also exceeds the budgeted amount of r1 000000 by r428 884,73 in variance in 14 days of the go. the results of metallographic examination of the tube used is presented in this paper. based on this analysis a new maintenance method using an acoustics approach is proposed in this paper. this approach can either work hand in hand with the soot blowing technology currently being used for the existing design of boilers to minimize the exposure of the tubes to pressure hot air or be used independently for a whole new design of boilers.","erosion, general overhaul, maintenance plan, soot blowers","The vibrations and sound waves from the use of an acoustic device may cause other different types of risks to the whole structure itself. Using AutoCAD Invertor 2016, parts of the acoustic horn were modelled and simulated against predicted forces and pressures. A frequency range of 60-70 Hz was used which fell currently into real life limitations and powerful enough for cleaning large vessels such as boilers and is more practical with a less amount of vibrations to be used for acoustic purpose. It is advised that improvements be done on the current design or combination of the soot blowing and acoustic may be used. As improvement of the current cleaning process (soot blowing) for the aim of more availability and minimizing breakdowns on the boiler plant and ultimately reducing maintenance cost [3, 7]. 6.

14,Finite Element Analysis On Multiple Axes Of 3D Designs  D.W.

For a more accurate comparison the simulated results could rather be simulated with loads using the ratio of 1KN=1000Mpa. This could possibly represent similar values between Table 1 and Table 2 but observing these results seems unlikely. Using the FDM printing method this study shows the inconsistency of each 3D print load failure. To better the outcome of this study more test specimens can be used and tested for a larger list of values to compare.

It could be argued that if the loads experienced are perpendicular to that of the FDM printed layering, the results obtained using the isometric material properties can be compared. Even though this could be, the results obtained in Tables 2 and 3 are nowhere that of the results yielded in Table 4. The results yielded in Table 4 for the practical compression tests are also between that of 25% infill and 50% infill whereas the results of the simulations obtained in Tables 2 and 3 are 100% solid. this could be why the results obtained in Tables 2 and 3 are much smaller than those seen in Table 4.

16,Investigation Of Radial Expansion Of Hollow Tubular  Devices For Support Of Underground Mining Excavations,"undergromd mining activity continues to contribute a huge part of the south african gross domestic product and as much as it is profitable, there are high risks involved in these kinds of mining operations. the safety of working personnel and equipment is of high importance to ensure it remains profitable. this report investiages how the safety of working personnel and equipment can be further improved by designing a yielding bolt under seismic activity. the principle of operation of the yield bolt is based on the science of radial expansion of hollow tubes in tension to provide intergrity to underground excavations. the reults shows how the principle can be used to mitigate the risks caused by seismic activity on mining operations.","underground mining, dynamic, mining operations, personnel safety, yielding bolt","The report is succesfull in showing the behaviour of a tube under going radial expansion by a mandrel. This working principle is incapusled in a bolt design to be used in underground mining excavations.It uses graphs,diagrams and descriptive analysis to explain this behaviour. The concept is to be used for ensuring the integrity of underground mining excavations as mineral extractions reach deeper under lengths. Due to the unpredictable nature of underground rock seismic activity, it is important to account for the worst case scenario.It was found that the performance of a yield bolt will differ depending on the nature of the seismic activity.The load bearing of the bolt is more consistent in the event of static seismic activity and tends to drop during dynamic activity. For this report, the tube is placed in tension during radial expansion. Similar studies have been conducted and placed the tube in compression,thus making it prone to buckling. Furthmore, the yielding force was not an important parameter because the concept of radial expansion of tubes was used to line drilled holes for oil extraction underground, the lining prevents soil and other foreign substances from contaminating the extracted oil with the benefit of keeping the soil intact on the sides as they drill deeper. 6.","n.tshitema department of mechanical and induistrial engineering technology university of johannesburg johannesburg, south africa email: ndalamo001@gmail.com d. v. v. kallon department of mechanical and induistrial engineering technology university of johannesburg johannesburg, south africa email: dkallon@uj.ac.za o. t. laseinde department of mechanical and induistrial engineering technology university of johannesburg johannesburg, south africa email: otlaseinde@uj.ac.za",
17,A Sustainable Conceptual Model For Pyrolysis To Power  Project Using Lignocellulosic Waste,"(12 font) a base case process design for the pyrolysis of pinedust and acacia tortilis residues was rated unsustainable due to the use of a fossil-based, high-cost energy source; the absence of energy integration and low yields of the targeted dry oil. incremental improvements were made using a logical matrix based on demonstrated best practices from literature, including the use of a fast pyrolysis regime to increase bio-oil quality and yield. more sustainable sources of energy such as the use of char by-products in a self-energizing system or the use of concentrated solar were proposed. integrating such improvements will improve the techno-economic outlook of the project by lowering the production cost of the pyrolysis oil while reducing the ecological impact of the process. we assumed the technical feasibility of utilizing the bio-oil as a substitute for fuel oils in slow engines, which has been theoretically proven and partially demonstrated. the logical matrix led to sustainable conceptual models for a pyrolysis system that can supply bio-oil for use in a heavy fuel oil power generator. bio-oil would be a cost-effective solution for substituting fuel oil, which is facing stiffer regulatory restrictions due to its high sulphur and black carbon emissions.","(12 font) biomass, bioenergy, conceptual model, pyrolysis","Literature gave satisfactory models that were useful in improving the techno-economic outlook of the pyrolysis systems. Both the self-energized and concentrated solar pyrolysis systems were found to be largely sustainable due to their ability to efficiently use waste-to-energy and renewable energy forms in the process. This greatly reduces reliance on fossil-fuel-based electricity and the associated socio-economic and environmental impacts. There are no policy restrictions in both countries for the use of the waste forestry residues, therefore the only binding issues on sustainability were the supply chain issues. A geographical information systems (GIS) spatial study is recommended to ensure a good supply chain strategy. Generally speaking, the socio-economic and ecological sustainability for such bio-energy projects that utilize waste is positive, which is the case for the pyrolysis system due to the clean energy supply, improved aesthetics and environment, along with employment creation in the biomass supply and value chains. However, there would be a need for a more detailed environmental impact assessment, which can be done using various methods including LCA or early process development evaluations. The next step would be to demonstrate the conceptual model in a pilot or industrial system involving all the system components. . Badger, P., Badger, S., Puettmann, M., Steele, P., & Cooper, J.

19,Implementation Of A Cloud-Based Enterprise Resource Planning System  At A South African Public Entity,"enterprise resource planning systems are comprehensive and complex software developed to consolidate business functions and processes. public entities are encouraged to implement such systems to improve internal process flow and service delivery, despite obvious challenges of the new technology implementation. elsewhere, many organisations have adopted erp systems notwithstanding the difficulties and inherent risks. using data from questionnaires and interviews, this study evaluated the factors that affect the implementation of microsoft dynamic 365 erp systems in public entity in south africa. the results indicate that the major challenges facing public entities, when it comes to the implementation of big projects, like erp systems, is the rigid nature of supplier selection processes.","business processes, cloud-based erp, public entities, simplifying","The findings from this study generally corroborate what is available in literature. This study confirmed that one of the main challenges facing public entities, when it comes to the implementation of big projects, like ERP systems, is the rigid nature of supplier selection processes, amongst other things. The NMI did not have complete control on ERP implementation collaboration team and partners and that influenced the effectiveness of the implementation strategy. Using the project management checklist, as a guideline, also identified parts of the implementation strategy that was not thoroughly considered. For future research, studies on successful ERP adoption and implementation in South Africa’s public sector should be conducted. More studies should also be conducted on Cloud ERP and what it can offer South Africa’s public organisations that other ERP systems were not able to offer.","b.m.b cebekhulu1, p.a. ozor1,2, c. mbohwa1 1. department of quality and operations management faculty of engineering and the built environment university of johannesburg auckland park, johannesburg, south africa musa.ceb@gmail.com, pozor@uj.ac.za, cmbohwa@uj.ac.za 2. department of mechanical engineering, faculty of engineering, university of nigeria nsukka",
20,2Dof Flexible Link Manipulator Model Simulation  Inventor: Finite Element Analysis With Varying Payloads,". robots are used to assist human beings in various applications. there is a need to improve the performance of robot structures by cutting cost and to provide light-weighted material systems. an area of flexible link manipulator has gained more interest from researchers in robotics. when compared with rigid-link manipulators, flexible manipulators are easy to manoeuvre, high-speed performance and higher payload-to-weight ratio. it has been noted that in previous and recent years’ experiments were proposed in analysing tip deflection. in this paper a model of 2dof flexible link manipulator (flm) in a cantilever configuration, it has been designed from a lightweight material. the aim is to assess the stability of the flm model with a set of varying payloads attached at the tip as to what will be the maximum load it can withstand. the inventor design tool was used to simulate the loading procedures, which assisted with finite element analysis. results are compared against the allowable maximum deflection limit of cantilever configuration. results on how the model deflects are produced with the safety factor at each loaded condition and numerical results of maximum deflection produced by the set of varying loads were compared with the fea results. and based on the results assessed, conclusions are made with a set of safety factor and how the light weighted design is advantageous in the industry to improve safety and performance.","model simulation, light material, fea, deflection","In this paper a study was carried out to validate the stability of a designed two link Flexible manipulator, the aim was to assess to what load it can hold to the allowable deflection. A limiting deflection value of 1,91mm was derived and a set of varying payloads were subjected at the tip of the model. With the help of Inventor software, finite element analysis (FEA) was carried out to simulate the set of varying payloads. It was found that at the load that can be withstood by the model is 32,5 N the deflection is 1,8898 mm which is approximately equals to allowable deflections, the von mises stress of 1229,92 MPa was produced, first principal stress found was 1342,71 MPa, third principal stress of 321,48 MPa and a maximum safety factor of 15 ul. It was seen from the results that the increase of varying loads the more the model deflects. It can be concluded that the aim of assessing the model stability was achieved, the model cannot be subjected to loads more than 32,5 N and the model is advantageous as it carries more load to its weight ratio. It can help reduce operation cost in the manufacturing industry as it was seen from the simulated results. Future studies can be carried out with a physical system actuated. 6.","at the tip. xs nyathi1 and fk tekweme1 1 department of mechanical and industrial engineering, university of johannesburg, 55 beit st, doornfontein, johannesburg 2028, south africa 201461366@student.uj.ac.za, fktekweme@uj.ac.za",
21,A Case Study On Teesta Water Conflict: A Game Theory  Approach,"conflict arises over shared resources when resource owners have individual strategy rather than collaboration. teesta river basin shared by india and bangladesh is known for its lack of an agreement between these two countries over sharing its waters. such situation is creating distress and misunderstandings between these two countries. in this paper we have used a system analysis technique including linear programming and game theory by considering a rational plan which includes water storage, power production, irrigation and salinity control. moreover using game theory we have investigated a range of strategies which will result in significant benefits for each country.","game theory, linear programming","Water resource management could become a complex job, as the stake-holders may hold sometimes conflicting and contradictory views and interest. The water resource distribution between Bangladesh and India is one such case. This issue is one of the burning thorns in these two countries relations for last few decades. The game theory could be an efficient tool for solving this issue. In this case study, linear programming and game theory have been used as the modeling approach to mitigate the hurdles and to look for the better solution to this burning issue. From the game model and Nash equilibrium we can see the 6th case where Bangladesh goes with their Dalia Project and India shares 50% of Teesta rivers water is most beneficial for both sides. In this scenario, both Bangladesh and India profits and they make up a profit of total 2.59 Million units. So it is the most stable solution. However, while developing the model due to lack of study there environmental economic effects have been neglected. This can be the future scope of study. In conclusion, game theory is quite a powerful tool in resolving water resource conflicts, as this approach not provides a clear comparison between the different water users, but is also beneficial to water decision makers.","faisal mahmud, esrat farhana dulia and anindya sen department of industrial and production engineering, bangladesh university of engineering and technology, dhaka-1000, bangladesh. e-mail: mahmudfaisal937@gmail.com, e.f.dulia@gmail.com, anindyasen55@gmail.com",

23,Ergonomic Assessment For A   Convenience Store Assistant,"nowadays, many workers were faced with the increasing incidence of work-related musculoskeletal disorders (msd); the industries had taken multiple initiatives to reduce the risk by design the mechanical machine or supportive tool based on ergonomic criteria. in this context, the current study has been carried out in groceries shop at where most of workers were continuously exposed to msd risk factors (e.g. repetitive manual tasks and awkward postures) and suffering from some kind of musculoskeletal complaint. the main objective of the current study was to evaluate ergonomic risk referred manual handling. in addition, the goal for this study is designing a specific tool to ease the workers and reduce risk. the methods used to evaluate the risk are rula and reba assessment. the scores of reba for all the workers are 10, 9 and 8 respectively while the rula score is 7 for all workers. besides, the intensity of work related injury was assessed using niosh lifting index. the workers score higher values for lifting index. the results showed that the ergonomic interventions are essential to reduce the mismatch between workers and workstations physical conditions, contributing to the postural correction and, consequently, to the msd prevention.","rula, reba","It was found that majority of groceries shop and small company did not know about ergonomic and risk related work. Specific organization should focus more on company in rural area and take immediate action for high risk. The worker of the groceries shop had been experienced in injury related to their work; muscle pain and back pain. Their working posture may be lead back pain and muscle pain. The role of the study was characterized by a length route for the worker to lift the load, frequent bending forward, lifting loads at awkward postures and exceed the standard load limit resulting in high degree of manual handling- related injuries. The future study can focused on the arrangement of the workplace or workplace layout. Workplace condition can be the source of risk to the worker. The enough space for the worker is necessary to ensure the worker feel comfortable and avoid hazardous at workplace.

24,A Review Of Logistics 4.0 Literature For Curriculum  Development For Vocational High Schools,"logistics 4.0 is an emerging phenomenon which is subsumed by industry 4.0 concept. the importance of digitalization of logistics activities is increasing because of the competitive environment both in manufacturing and service areas. it is obvious that the implementation of logistics 4.0 concepts in enterprises will be possible by technical-skilled employees. whilst there is a significant amount of academic studies for logistics 4.0, studies for logistics 4.0 education is very limited. universities’ and vocational high schools’ logistics departments’ lectures and courses must include logistics 4.0 concepts and applications to provide technical- skilled work force to the industry. this study aims to investigate logistics 4.0 key concepts and to propose a structural logistics 4.0 curriculum for the vocational high schools. to achieve this aim, 106 papers have been investigated and it has been seen that internet of things (iot), big data and robotic technologies are the most mentioned ones in the frame of logistics. these concepts have been recommended as the topics which should be implemented into the logistics 4.0 curriculum of vocational high schools.","curriculum, lecture, industry 4.0",,"kerem elibal bcs metal co. gaziantep, turkey keremelibal@gmail.com eren özceylan industrial engineering department gaziantep university gaziantep, turkey eozceylan@gantep.edu.tr, erenozceylan@gmail.com",

26,Comparative Experimental Performance Evaluation Of  Longitudinal And Transverse Four-Pass Soda Can Solar Air,"comparative experimental performance evaluation of longitudinal and transverse four-pass soda can solar air heater has been studied. the aluminum soda can was used as the absorber plate of the solar air heater. two design configurations, transverse and longitudinal arrangements, of the solar air heater’s absorber plate were studied. the tests were carried out at different tilt angles of 0o, 7o, 14o, 21o and 28o between may and june 2019 and readings were taken on daily basis from 8:00 hrs. to 17:00 hrs. the outlet velocity, inlet and outlet temperature of each arrangement were measured. parametric plots were made with the measured parameters and the efficiencies were computed and compared. even at a low insolation value, the transverse arrangement recorded a 10% more useful energy gain and 15% higher cumulative efficiency than the longitudinal arrangement. temperatures of about 105.4oc and 103.1oc at a mass flowrate of 0.019 kg/s, suitable for industrial and agricultural applications, were recorded for the transverse and the longitudinal arrangement, respectively.","solar air heaters, aluminum soda cans, thermal efficiency","The performance of the longitudinal and transverse arrangement of a four-pass soda can air heater has been studied. The results of both arrangements showed that the four-pass soda can air heater can give an outlet temperature of 105.4oC and 103.1oC respectively in rainy reason. Such a temperature is high enough for industrial use. The lower temperatures are good for home heating and agricultural drying purposes. The configurations of the system (transverse and longitudinal absorber arrangement) that will give the best performance have also been determined. The results were consistent in all the modes. They show that even in the rainy season, when sky is mostly cloudy, both SCAH configurations would still be able to establish a good temperature difference in the fluid. This shows that the aluminum soda cans can serve as good absorber materials for air collectors. However, the mass flow rate is a factor to be considered in the design and decision to use the SCAH.","heaters ifeanyi o. jacobs*, chigbo a. mgbemene, agwu ndukwe, anthony o. okoani and ndudim h. ononiwu mechanical engineering department university of nigeria, nsukka ifeanyi.jacobs@unn.edu.ng, chigbo.mgbemene@unn.edu.ng, agwu.ndukwe@unn.edu.ng, anthony.okoani@unn.edu.ng, ndudim.ononiwu@unn.edu.ng",
27,Optimizing The Weight Of Crawler Chain System At Quarry  During Cement Manufacturing Process.,"cement manufacturing process is not stable and efficient due to the bulk nature of the crawler chain system. the bulk nature of the crawler chain during operation uses high energy that is also a major concern during operation. for decades now, researchers have used several approaches to optimize the design of crawler chain system to improve stability, efficiency and energy during cement manufacturing. the weight of the crawler chain design is still heavy with several operational problems reported during cement manufacturing. it is therefore imperative to optimize the current design of crawler chain system such that the system operates with speed at optimal weight, which will not lead to mechanical failures. as such, optimal weight, low operational cost and low operational energy will be achieving during operation. in the current study, the tool of finite element analysis was used to optimize the weight of the crawler chain design during operation. the effects of material used and their impact on weight were modelled theoretically and validated by finite element analysis. the following were revealed after theoretical model and finite element analysis (1) it showed there was an optimal weight that gave optimal performance during cement manufacturing process. (2) it also revealed that to improve on performance and speed, the weight of the crawler design must be minimised. study showed a close correlation between theoretical model results and results of finite element analysis.","crawler chain, f- force, t –torque, r -radius","The chain was designed and it met the anticipated upshot design and the preliminary needs of the project. The chain is 50% lighter than the initial chain mass of 30kg per link. However, the chain is also strong enough to withstand the high torque induced by the gearbox. The cost to manufacture the chain is reasonable enough for a once off production. The present chain design is easy to manufacture and assemble i.e. no complex machining needed to produce the chain. Furthermore, it reduces the issue of too many manpower to dismantle the equipment or moving it from one point to the other since the weight has been reduced drastically according to proposed plan and objectives. The great achievement in this research is that the working hours wastage during the maintenance activites was reduced and numbers of skilled personnel was also reduced as well. 7. Recommendations Further refining of the chain could be done in order to reduce the cost of machining. The chain must be trialed on a small scale prototype to see if there will be any unforeseen complications that may arise during the manufacturing process of the typical chain. A resilience test can be done to the chain model to predict the possible areas of failure in future.","a. o. aniki department of mechanical engineering, vaal university of technology p.m.b x021, vanderbijlpark, 1900. gauteng. south africa abimbolaa@vut.ac.za o. a. olanrewaju department of industrial engineering, durban university of technology: p.o.box 1334, durban, kwa-zulu natal, 4000. oludolapoo@dut.ac.za c. mborhwa department of industrial engineering, university of johannesburg: auckland park bunting road campus, johannesburg, 2031. cmbohwa@uj.ac.za",
28,"Automated Waste Characterisation And Sorting For Large  Institutions Through Conceptualisation, Design And","a perennial crisis of growing waste accumulations and natural resource depletion are major challenges for most parts of the world today, of which many have explored recycling as a solution. however, recycling is impeded by the need to sort waste by material types before processing. additionally, the composition of municipal solid waste is so random such that the processes cost more than the value of recyclables. this research aimed at increasing the quantum of waste recycled, by using waste sorting machines at large institutions such as universities and hospitals. unlike municipal solid waste, the composition of the waste from such institutions was less random and could be analysed through waste characterisation and sorting. waste characterisation was conducted for a university and the data directly integrated into the design and subsequent calibration of a customized and automated waste sorting machine. the modular and calibratable machine capable of sorting 200kg of waste per hour was designed, with an estimated cost of usd 5,966.72. the automated design was sound and sustainable, based on the simulation and stress analysis carried out, capable of achieving 12m travel distance per item and at least 85% accuracy in sorting, with von misses stresses not exceeding 0.168 mpa.",automation,"This project has revealed the role that waste characterisation at large institutions (such as universities, hospitals and business parks) can play in encouraging recycling through use of waste sorting machines designed to make use of this data. The waste sorting machine that was designed can be calibrated to sort new types of waste and respond to trends in the waste stream. Additionally, once in use, the machine can automatically provide accurate waste characterisation meaning institutions can observe the effectiveness of any waste management plans they have in place and identify any trends in their waste streams. The total cost of the machine was calculated to be USD 5,966.72, based on the current market and labour prices both locally and internationally. Though no prototype of the machine was produced, detailed simulations were carried to demonstrate the functioning of the machine. Recycling can play a major role in dealing with environmental problems and reducing natural resource shortages. Using waste sorting machines at large institutions (such as universities) can greatly increase the amount of waste being recycled. The physical state of the waste being produced at these institutions allows for relatively simple waste sorting techniques to be used which cannot be used with municipal solid waste, allowing for simpler waste sorting machine design. The waste sorting machine is anticipated to reduce/eliminate the transportation of recyclables to dumps, and instead recyclables can be sorted from the mixed waste by the machine and then transported or sold to recycling centres. As a result, large institutions can play an active role in reducing the amount of waste going to landfills and increasing the amount of waste being recycled. Incorporation of the Internet of Things and Big Data can go a long way in encouraging the adoption of this waste sorting machine on a large scale by making real-time analysis easily available.

29,The Lighter The Better: Weight Reduction In The Automotive  Industry And Its Impact On Fuel Consumption And Climate,"the automotive industry is growing faster than any other industry and neck on neck with this growth is the demand for lightweight components. this is a pull factor, which is primarily influenced by the drive towards reducing fuel consumption and emissions to the atmosphere. the stakes are very high in the quest to satisfy the insatiable customer hunger for reduced fuel consumption. stringent emission regulations have also been put in place in order to mitigate the adverse effects of global warming. this has placed tremendous pressure for an increased production of light vehicle components. hence the lighter the better, and this paper focuses on the lightweighting technologies that are being implemented in the automotive industry, and how weight reduction is vital in reducing vehicle fuel consumption and global warming. two weight reduction methods, material substitution and topology optimization are reviewed and analyzed based on cost, strength and stiffness. the paper also discusses the contribution that vehicle mass has on the driving cycle when compared to other parameters that affect fuel consumption.","lightweighting, fuel consumption",,"change gibson p chirinda department of industrial engineering university of stellenbosch stellenbosch, south africa gibbschirinda@gmail.com / 24588636@sun.ac.za stephen matope department of industrial engineering university of stellenbosch stellenbosch, south africa smatope@sun.ac.za",
30,"Electrification Through Renewable Resources In A Rural  Area In Nigeria: Design, Optimization And Techno-","the electricity generation through renewable resources is a crying need to increase the rural electrification rate to an appreciable value in nigeria. electricity can be supplied through either the national grid being extended or through off-grid systems. the grid extension cost depends on the location of the area, its terrain, the number of households, and distance of the area from a grid point. however, based on these factors and inadequate supply of electricity to even the areas connected to the national grid, renewable energy sources may provide an alternative means of electricity generation in rural areas in nigeria. this research paper highlighted the design, evaluation, and the techno-economic feasibility of providing electricity to rural dilchidama in nigeria through renewable energy sources. total 77 households, 1 primary school, 1 primary health centre and 4 shops having total estimated load of 306 kwh/d were considered. the design and techno-economic feasibility of the renewable resource was compared with extending the national grid to the area using homer and retscreen tools. the results showed that grid extension is much more cost competitive than the solar photovoltaic system for the study area for a maximum distance of 9.9 km. the sensitivity analysis performed by varying several input parameters indicated that solar photovoltaic renewable resource is a potential alternative beyond 9.9 km distance from the grid.","renewable energy, photovoltaic, electrification","This study presented the design and economic evaluation of electrifying 77 residential houses, 4 shops, a primary school and a primary health centre in rural Dilchidama. The design, optimization and sensitivity results indicated that Solar PV technology is a viable means of electrifying Dilchidama due to the electricity production rate and good economic prospect in energy investment with a COE at US$ 0.579/kWh. However, when the design considered extending grid to the study area and compared it with a Solar PV system technology and Solar PV & diesel generator based system, the results indicated that grid extension if adequately supplied is more competitive for the village and villages with the same geographical data and terrain and are at a distance of less than 9.99 km and 6.90 km respectively. Although, the prices of solar PV components are gradually decreasing, Nigerian government can expand the renewable technology market and utilization by providing; loans, subsidies & grants, Feed-in-Tariff, etc. and also making a percentage of renewable energy sources into the energy-mix of the country thereby making renewable sources becoming more competitive in the near future.

31,Proposed Roadmap For Product And Process Redesign In The  Migration From Joining Processes To Monolithic Parts,"continuous improvement is the cornerstone of business survival as the chase to satisfy the ever-changing market demand intensifies in the midst of the reality of global competition. the improvements may be in the product, the process or both and can be minor or major changes. this paper presents a proposed roadmap and guideline for the product and process re-design when migrating from joining processes to monolithic parts in the production of sheet- metal components. the research focuses on replacing tig welding as a joining process with deep drawing to produce monolithic components. a hypothetical cylindrical cup of height 56 mm and diameter 100 mm is used as a case study and superimposed in the two manufacturing methods and the end product evaluated using simulations. the starting sheet material is aluminium 6061 of 2 mm thickness. the results show a minimum weight reduction of 5% for the deep drawn component. the weight reduction also results in corresponding cost reduction. a five-step roadmap with specific work packages is proposed for smooth migration. the proposed steps are product redesign, process design, tool design, tool manufacture and product manufacture.","tig welding, deep drawing, ashby","In conclusion, there is a lot of potential for the replacement of TIG welding with monolithic components produced by sheet metal forming through deep drawing. As the production volumes increase at times the TIG welding becomes slower especially when done manually. The research achieved a reduction in weight of at least 5 % for the deep drawn component used in the simulation. The weight reduction is desirable in saving resources hence also reduces the cost of producing the product. The deep drawing process also has 80% shorter cycle times compared to TIG welding and there is potential to benefit from economies of scale. A five-step roadmap is proposed for the migration from TIG to deep drawing. The steps involved are product redesign, process design, tool design, tool manufacture and product manufacture. It is recommended that the steps be carried out concurrently in order to minimise the migration time. Incorporating life cycle thinking through out the stages will ensure sustainability.","production for sheet-metal components blessed sarema, stephen matope industrial engineering department stellenbosch university cape town, south africa blesarema@gmail.com; smatope@sun.ac.za",

33,The Impact Of Covid-19 On The Pharmaceutical Supply  Chain,"the covid-19 pandemic has disrupted the everyday lives of people and businesses around the world, and a field greatly affected has been the united states pharmaceutical supply chain. this global pandemic has made preexisting issues within the supply chain’s structure more glaring than before with people’s lives being at risk. demand for drugs is at least equivalent and likely higher in this current health setting. if companies are not providing the appropriate medications to their customers, then it can be the difference between life and death for some. to investigate the challenges behind the supply chain, the analysis was focused on problems before covid-19, such as the lack of transparency, burdensome regulations, and logistical issues due to improper distribution. an investigation on how covid-19 has impacted each specific part of the pharmaceutical supply chain leads to a discussion on what recommendations could be implemented to fix the presented issues. the u.s. pharmaceutical supply chain is a complex, global system that has become increasingly more challenging to navigate because of covid-19. shortages need to be mitigated, and the inevitability of a future vaccine for the virus needs to follow a proper logistics and distribution model to ensure its success.","covid-19, pharmaceuticals, supply chain","and Moving Forward The COVID-19 global pandemic has highlighted several glaring problems that, when considered together, amount to a high risk for failure in the pharmaceutical supply chain. Though there has not yet been a critical shortage of drugs due to manufacturer shutdowns, the act of the shutdowns themselves may be enough to push the United States to reconsider its dependency on just a few countries to supply the necessary materials and labor to produce drugs for U.S. citizens. To make matters even riskier, those same few countries lack communication and transparency regarding their processes, leading to quality issues that further constrain the supply available. Within the transportation and delivery sections of the supply chain, there has been a massive struggle to meet the needs of customers, with so many service workers falling ill or refusing to work under the current pandemic conditions. Once the drug a customer needs becomes available, the customer must be provided with and accept the opportunity to receive their products safely without unnecessary risk of exposure to infection. All agents within the pharmaceutical supply chain must acknowledge these problems, and their accompanying risks, as well as, consider the proposed recommendations if they are to protect the supply chain and allow for continued growth in the future.","sydney strong, prescott delzell, walter trygstad, garrett fitzpatrick, piper haley-hyer, ashley bates and mohamed awwad industrial and manufacturing engineering department california polytechnic state university san luis obispo, ca 93407, usa systrong@calpoly.edu, pdelzell@calpoly.edu, wtrygsta@calpoly.edu, gfitzpat@calpoly.edu, phaleyhy@calpoly.edu, aabates@calpoly.edu, mawwad@calpoly.edu",
34,The Relation Between Renewable Energy Consumption And  Economic Growth:,"the purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship between renewable energy and economic growth which is determined by the gross domestic product per capita regarding some of the mediterranean countries. this study uses data from some mediterranean countries with medium to high energy consumption levels in 1990–2015 (france, italy, and turkey) to ascertain and analyze the multiple effects of renewable energy consumption on economic process. the applied math analysis relies on descriptive statistics, cluster analysis, and divulges that all the variables area unit are related; this means, on the long term, a correlation between the dependent variable quantity of gross domestic product and the independents variables of renewable energy consumption and energy consumption. moreover, the results show that there's a better correlation between res’ consumption and the economic growth of some countries that has an upper gross domestic product than with those of lower gdp. the obtained results area unit is consistent with different papers reviewed during this study. analysis results show the long run linear impact of energy consumption on economic process.","renewable energy, economic growth, gdp","On one hand, the transformation of latest energy consumption can often bring economic costs, thereby leading to a negative impact on economic process. On the opposite hand, economic value often disappears, thereby leading to the positive impact of the transformation of latest energy consumption on economic process. The results of the study can be summarized as follows: Renewable energy contributes effectively to achieving sustainable development. Its exploitation by humans does not have any negative impact on the environment and this contributes to its preservation, which confirms the basic premise. Countries with a high level of human development are also among the countries that use the most renewable energy, compared to those with less use. There is a direct relationship between each of the GDP and renewable energy consumption (REC). Where the increase in renewable energy consumption by 1% led to an increase of GDP by 10% in France, as well as reflect the value of p.value which is 0.92 for the significance of the relationship between the two variables. A quantity of factors has an impact on the GDP growth estimated in this study, such as investment in renewable strength deployment, fossil fuel production and trade, and electrical energy prices. Investments particularly influence GDP growth the foremost, triggered by the capital-intensive nature of renewable energy technologies compared to different choices. Most of the complete fee of renewable energy plants is used for the upfront funding on physical assets, as hostile to gasoline expenditure throughout the lifecycle of the plant. As the demand for electricity grows, proportionate investments in strength infrastructure will be needed. To keep away from lock-in with unsustainable energy systems, and recognize the potential benefits, energy sector investments should increasingly be directed towards renewable energy. Investment in renewable energy throughout all sectors must be scaled up substantially. The power region will proceed to attract most of the new investment. This report estimates the GDP based on renewable energy consumption for each of the 3 cases; as nicely as the capital costs, discount rates and different parameters required for every technology in each country and year to be able to achieve the growth needed.

35,Contradictions And Complements Of Lean Administration   And Digitalization,"background – in order to withstand an increasing pressure of competition, to provide customers with constantly improved quality and innovations, while at the same time securing the financing from operating businesses, processes have to be optimized and non-value-added activities have to be eliminated. in this context, recent digital technologies promise significant improvements in managing complexity. congruently, administrative power must be continuously increased to keep overheads low. lean administration offers this potential. purpose – this paper contributes to the discussion on the relationship of lean administration and digitalization, and whether companies should excel in either first before drawing to the other. methodology/approach – in order to address the research question, expert interviews have been chosen as a qualitative approach. process managers and lean experts of companies from different industrial sectors were interviewed to investigate the relation of lean administration and digitalization. findings – results show that on the one hand lean administration can profit from advances in digitalization, while on the other hand lean administration supports the digital transformation. experts attest both a symbiotic relationship. furthermore, a correlation between a company’s lean and digital maturity is observed. rather than either of both is a prerequisite for the other, they rely on similar organizational conditions and requirements.","lean administration, digitalization, zimbabwe, december 7-10","Digitalization makes a key contribution to the sustainable implementation of lean administration. Just like lean administration supports digitalization. In Figure 1 most companies are situated along a diagonal line that illustrates a positive correlation between lean administration and digitalization. A vertical intercept of approximately 2.5 proposes that digital maturity is a prerequisite for lean administration. However, further development of both should ideally be a parallel process, rather than a sequential one. Interpreting the shift one has to keep in mind that although lean management is well established in production it has been neglected within an administrative setting in the past. Most approaches to increase efficiency in an office are to be attributed to the introduction of individual digital technologies. Experts agree that the lack of success of these work-place oriented measures are due to a lack of structure and a missing comprehensive approach. A circular relationship between lean administration and digitization is regarded as a suitable starting point to address this difficulties. As a starting point company’s have to focus on customers, clearly defining customer-value-adding targets of lean and digital efforts and in a second step aligning these with the corporate strategy. Finally, core processes are mapped out to reveal inefficiencies and complexities to be addressed. An already optimized process can be further improved and made more efficient with digital innovations. The transparency gained also increases the acceptance of the measures. In this context, digital technologies often open up new ways to improve performance, radically replacing existing processes. With regard to the implementation, both build on similar organizational conditions. Rather than either of both being a prerequisite for the other, a symbiotic relationship is attested. A parallel approach of implementation helps to overcome difficulties and to exploit synergies. Successful companies carefully plan both within a comprehensive strategy to design efforts of substantial value, rather than overhasty shooting for stars. In order to combine both approaches in a meaningful way, the focus must be placed on the customer as well as the employees working with the digitized and optimized processes, daily. The link in this relationship are organizational requirements and culture. These findings should be taken into account when building models and frameworks for lean and digital transformations in an office setting.","christoph szedlak, kristin wagner, bert leyendecker university of applied sciences koblenz, faculty of operations management konrad-zuse-str. 1, 56075 koblenz, germany {szedlak, krwagner, leyendecker}@hs-koblenz.de",

39,Investigations Into Solar Powered Stirling  Engines For  Electricity  Generation,"the stirling engine was an industrial one invention to address the problem of constant explosions of steam engine boilers due to excessive pressures. the stirling engine converts heat energy to torque. the salient safety feature is based on temperature difference rather than pressure difference of the steam engine. the efficiency of the stirling engine vests with its geometric and thermodynamic properties such that under ideal conditions, the thermodynamic efficiency equals that of a carnot cycle. the stirling engine operates on a closed thermodynamic cycle. the thermodynamics of the system pertains to the working fluids and heat transfers whilst, the geometric design incorporates the configuration, crank mechanism, sizing and layout. the efficiency of the stirling engine decreases with an increase in cylinder size, thus multiple smaller cylinders systemically connected to a single crank shaft are more efficient than a bigger single cylinder engine. this paper reviews the design of a stirling engine to be powered by a laboratory concentrated solar energy heat source. the idea emanated from nasa’s 10kw krusty nuclear powered electrical generator that was designed for the mars expedition.","stirling engine, , heat transfer, thermodynamics",,"p. khoza, p. naidoo and s.h.connell department of mechanical engineering science university of johannesburg auckland park, johannesburg, rsa 201203250@uj.student.ac.za; naidoop@uj.ac.za, shconnell@uj.ac.za",

The proposed framework is useful to determine the implementation level of Industry 4.0 across all partners of the supply chain. It enables a holistic evaluation across the dimensions viz. smart supply chain, smart working, smart manufacturing, and smart product. Besides, AHP is used for the prioritisation of the identified dimensions, which helps in arriving at a final score.

41,Application Of Lean Tools In Planned Maintenance: Case  Study Of A Coal Handling Plant At A Thermal Power Station,"in today’s highly competitive business environment every company thrives to increase its overall production and profit. maintenance related costs contribute to some of the major expenses related to running a business. in other words, maintenance activities share significant operating costs in an organisation. reducing maintenance costs without affecting the plant performance improves the profitability of an organisation. reduction in maintenance costs can be effectively achieved by means of reducing the non-value-added costs and activities involved in the maintenance process. lean thinking can be incorporated into maintenance activities through application of its principles, practices and tools. in this paper, preventive maintenance activities related to a coal handling plant at a thermal power station are assessed using value stream mapping (vsm) tools in order to identify maintenance wastes and to demonstrate the association between maintenance wastes and the lean manufacturing tools. the current state map revealed that non-value adding activities contributed to 16.25% of the total maintenance time. improving the status quo would see the overall plant availability including the generating plant improve by 0.158%. although this appears insignificant, the loss in generation due to unavailability of the coal plant has an impact. the power plant generates an average of 90 gwh a year and a 0.158% plant availability will translate to a gain of 142 200kwh annually translating to usd14220 at a cost of usd0.10 per kwh","lean manufacturing, lean maintenance","Maintenance is a critical contributor to progressing towards world-class manufacturing of any organisation. It has rapidly grown into a very complex undertaking as technologies, competition, and product characteristics have evolved. In order to achieve world-class performance, the maintenance strategies should be linked to manufacturing strategies such as the lean concept. Applying an effective maintenance strategy can ensure a high degree of utilisation, reliability, and availability of manufacturing facilities especially in a continuous production process. VSM and Lean Maintenance provides an opportunity for effective maintenance. Moreover, it promotes the culture of continuous improvement aiming at maintenance excellence. Nevertheless, commitment and direct involvement of an organisational management along with employee training and teamwork development can be a catalyst to accelerate the transformation process. However, Lean Maintenance approach cannot just be a mirror image of a lean manufacturing approach because the business dynamics of asset maintenance and those of production are fundamentally different. Therefore, it is clear that there is a need to develop an effective process to collectively integrate and customise lean thinking into the maintenance with long-term strategic perspective.","isaac chinhengo, william m. goriwondo, blessed sarema department of industrial and manufacturing engineering national university of science and technology bulawayo, zimbabwe william.goriwondo@nust.ac.zw; blessed.sarema@nust.ac.zw",
42,Computational Fluid Dynamics And Simulation Of A Mixing  Mould Unit Of A Mini Foam Batch Production Plant,"polyurethane foams are found in almost every home, whether in flexible or rigid form, and the demand for this product is high since it is a vital product for every home. thus, there is a need to improve the quality and production rate of this valuable product. in this research, simulation and performance evaluation of a mixing and mould unit of a batch foam production plant were conducted. computational fluid dynamics was employed to determine the effect of the stirrer in adequate mixing of the foam reactant chemicals, the velocity distribution of the flow through the mixer, temperature and flow rate of the product at the outlet of the foam mixing tank. the cfx- solver, on completion of the simulation, provided the flow variables. the results obtained at the inlet of the foam mixing tank include an average inlet velocity of 0.3m/s, the average inlet pressure of 30,460 pa, and an average mass flow rate of 0.000148 kg/s. the temperature of the fluids at the outlet corresponds to 323k showing an increase in the flow rate of the fluids after mixing with the mass flow rate of 0.000780 kg/s. therefore, it was concluded that cfd is a viable tool in predicting fluid flow behavior in mixing equipment.","simulation, polyurethane foam","The results obtained from the simulation is an exposition and demonstration of the working principle and operation of the fluid mixing process. The following results were obtained at the outlet of the foam mixing tank on completion of the CFD simulation. They include average outlet velocity of 2.0 m/s, average outlet pressure of 11.46 Pa, average mass flow rate of - 0.000780 kg/s (negative sign indicates mass flow out of domain), and average outlet temperature of 323 K. Besides, there was an increase in the flow rate of the fluids after mixing. This is evident from the computed mass flow rate of 0.000780 kg/s. Thus, it can be concluded that CFD is a viable technique for effective prediction of fluid flow behavior in mixing equipment.

47,An Analysis Of The Inventory Management Challenges: The  Case Of Gypsum Plasterboard Manufacturing Company In,"the purpose of this paper is to analyze the challenges associated with the inventory management system at a gypsum plasterboard manufacturing company in south africa, hereafter referred to as boardplant. the study is a case study that was conducted in the warehouse of boardplant at a facility in johannesburg. the facility manufactures a wide range of plasterboard products for ceilings and drywall partitioning. the study was conducted after the company’s management had raised concerns on the inventory losses and on the management approach that was not supporting the strategic goals of the company. the data was collected through interviews and the data collection instrument was a questionnaire with open ended questions. participants were purposively selected from the sales, operations and planning functions of the company. participants had between one to ten years of experience in the company. data was analyzed through thematic approach. it was found out that the company’s processes, procedures and records were not adequate to enable proper management of the inventory. moreover, the warehouse was not integrated with the other key functions of the company. boardplant needs to invest in an integrated inventory management system. key words inventory management challenges, gypsum plasterboard manufacturing, integrated system, case study, south africa proceedings of the 2nd african international conference on industrial engineering and operations management harare, zimbabwe, december 7-10, 2020 © ieom society international 689",,"has been drawn that lack of application of inventory management techniques has resulted in trends of inventory losses namely, 1) Increased inventory holding 2) slow moving stock 3) inventory damages and scrapping. Despite the losses, there is one benefit of reduction of obsolesce stock seen through application of FIFO/LIFO technique. Literature surrounding inventory management done by (Heizer, Munson, Barry, 2017), (Chase & Jacobs, 2018), (Muller, 2011) and (Vrat, 2014b) strongly suggest that proper application of inventory management techniques aids in mitigating inventory management challenges. Adoption of these techniques can assist the organisation in successfully managing their inventory. The findings from this study are also significant in identifying the need for Boardplant to provide extensive training needs on inventory policies to their inventory controllers, findings show that 45% of participants are not knowledgeable on inventory policy currently in use as per table 1.6. The study concludes that despite the challenges seen on inventory control, Boardplant has a warehouse design advantage to manage inventory efficiently, the warehouse is designed with a WMS in place to support efficient flow of inventory in and out of the warehouse, further to conclude, Boardplant need to invest in adequate resources (Skilled IT, and Stuff) to support their inventory investment. According to (Sohail & Sheikh, 2018) return of investments of inventory management will come as increased margins, supportive employee morale and customer satisfaction. 6. Recommendations In light of the study findings and conclusions, it is recommended that Boardplant need to improve their inventory management practice through efficient use of their inventory management system and policy. Boardplant needs to revisit their inventory policy, redesign it while incorporating concepts such as JIT, manufacturing systems, EOQ and ABC classification so that their policy can be adaptable to changing customer needs and warehouse practices, this concepts will aid with improved management of inventory practices. Resource allocation and training investment needs to be party of company strategic development to succeed in investment management. 7.","south africa madzivhandila ntendeleni lawrence department of mechanical and industrial engineering technology university of johannesburg johannesburg, south africa lawrence.madzi@gmail.com forbes chiromo department of mechanical and industrial engineering technology university of johannesburg johannesburg, south africa fchiromo@uj.ac.za",
48,Conceptualization Of The Lecture ‘Digitalization And Digital  Transformation In Metal Forming’ Based On Implications,"in the modern world, the economy and society are affected by ongoing changes triggered by a multitude of influencing factors, e.g., digitalization, (g)localization, and global pandemics. therefore, industrial engineering education needs to focus on the ongoing evaluation and the continuous development of new, respectively adapted, teaching and learning approaches to contribute to the continuous development of abilities, skills, and competences of the human workforce. based on the implications of current teaching and learning theories, this paper focuses on the conceptualization of the lecture ‘digitalization and digital transformation in metal forming’. as a result, the authors present a module-based structure that includes theoretical lectures, practical demonstrations, group discussions, and industrial case studies. the developed teaching and learning concept can be used as a reference guideline to contribute to professionalization and lifelong learning for the industrial engineering profession. 1 introduction industry 4.0 approaches offer a multitude of new concepts and technologies to increase the competitiveness of manufacturing enterprises by relying on the basic principles of digital interconnectivity, autonomization, self-control of systems, and big-data analysis (bosch et al., 2017; woschank and zsifkovits, 2021). thereby, the usage of new technologies like artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning, as well as other it-related innovations, will have a significant impact on the many fields of action within a manufacturing enterprise, e.g., on the strategic and tactical process optimization, cyber-physical systems, predictive maintenance, hybrid decision support systems, production planning and control systems, and the improvement of operational processes (woschank et al., 2020). in this context, the systematic evaluation of potential barriers and necessary requirements for a successful implementation of industry 4.0 initiatives indicates a tremendous need for the realignment of current learning and teaching approaches in industrial engineering education (dallasega et al., 2019; 2020; woschank and pacher, 2020). proceedings of the 2nd african international conference on industrial engineering and operations management harare, zimbabwe, december 7-10, 2020 © ieom society international 703",,,"from contemporary teaching and learning theories benjamin j. ralph chair of metal forming montanuniversitaet leoben franz josef-strasse 18, 8700 leoben, austria benjamin.ralph@unileoben.ac.at corina pacher resources innovation center montanuniversitaet leoben franz josef-strasse 18, 8700 leoben, austria corina.pacher@unileoben.ac.at manuel woschank chair of industrial logistics montanuniversitaet leoben erzherzog johann-strasse 3/1, 8700 leoben, austria manuel.woschank@unileoben.ac.at","References

51,Plastic Waste Management In South Africa,"the presence of unwanted waste can constitute a threat on a global scale. this is because waste negatively affects human health, wildlife, marine ecosystems and the environment. plastic wastes pose serious problem to the environment. this burden is evident in south africa due to lack of plastic waste solutions as about 10% get recycled. from reliable studies, up to 34.1% of south africans are subject to open burning, illegal dumping and picking in order to sell plastics to buy back centres. picking boost the income for poorer communities. the rapidly increasing population has underscore the need for municipalities to provide effective waste management in growing communities. apart from the increasing need for effective waste management, limited government interventions and legislations can limit waste management. this paper attempts to review the current state of both private and public waste management practices in south africa. this highlights the current initiatives and methods of waste management as well as the gaps in each initiative. the study use literature review and case study approach to analyse the major issues and the effect of growing population on the subsisting waste management system. the results highlight suggestions that promises significant benefits in transforming and improving the existing management practices.","plastic waste, environment","This paper has reviewed the current state of plastic waste management in South Africa, government legislations, public and private interventions as well as the effect of the escalating population on the plastic waste management in South Africa. This paper has provided a comprehensive review on the common techniques of waste management and interventions. It has been highlighted that the increasing population and increasing consumption of materials has created a burden on the waste management system particularly on municipalities. Therefore, current legislations and interventions are no longer as effective as before in meeting the waste management needs in South Africa. This is evident in the low recycling statistics and the percentage of South Africans that do not have access to safe waste management practices. Improvement on waste infrustructure, educating South Africans, and increasing availability of waste services is indeed necessary in improving the state of waste management in the country.","unatshilidzi benedictus khangale department of quality and operations management, faculty of engineering and the built environment, university of johannesburg, doornfontein campus, 2092, south africa 215027840@student.uj.ac.za paul amaechi ozor department of quality and operations management, faculty of engineering and the built environment, university of johannesburg, doornfontein campus, 2092, south africa pozor@uj.ac.za department of mechanical engineering, faculty of engineering, university of nigeria, 410001, nsukka enugu state, nigeria paul.ozor@unn.edu.ng charles mbohwa department of quality and operations management, faculty of engineering and the built environment, university of johannesburg, doornfontein campus, 2092, south africa cmbohwa@uj.ac.za",
52,Investigation Into Innovation Management In A Weapon  Manufacturing Company,"for any weapon manufacturing company to be competitive globally, it should come up with strategic activities that will assist it to manage its technology innovations. as the world is moving to the fourth industrial revolution, there is a need for organisations to continuously be innovative. competition in the defense sector is increasing rapidly and weapon manufactures need to be proactive and gear up their technology in order to remain globally competitive. this paper presents the results of a study that sort to find out how a south african weapon manufacturing company strategizes in order to promote innovation among its employees. a qualitative approach using semi-structured interviews was taken. the results show that most of the weapons produced are in maturity and technology limit phase. additionally, finance and knowledge acquisition have an important role in influencing the innovation activates within the company. organisational systems and practices as well as innovation targets were found to be major contributors to the success/failure of the management of innovation. the study proposes a frame for managing innovation in a defence technology company.",innovation,", Implications and Recommendations This investigation has taken a step towards combining very diverse literature into a single framework. The proposed framework can be used to evaluate an organisation’s innovation activities, discover the extent to which the organization is supposedly innovative or whether or not innovation is entrenched in the organization, and identify areas for improvement. From the analyses of the results obtained during this study it is evident that there is no clear known strategy in the company. Without a clear known strategy it is a challenge not only to implement innovation but also to manage the innovation process. Having a visible strategy will assist the organisation to come up with effective innovation management processes that include innovation targets, incentives and indicators.

55,Intelligent Traffic Light Control,"among the global problems emanating from vehicular traffic across various cities, which include but not limited to, security, parking, pollution and congestion and with the fact of the impracticality of changing the infrastructure of urban area, researchers in most cases consent that such problems may be alleviated by correctly staging the traffic lights which helps in improving the flow of vehicles across cities. in order to efficiently solve this congestion issue, reduce the total journey duration experienced by each vehicle, increase the total number of vehicles reaching their destination per unit of time and to decrease the amount of pollution emitted by the moving vehicles, this problem is addressed. two different approaches are proposed, the first approach is a proactive approach based on recurrent neural network (rnn) and long short-term memory (lstm) to predict the traffic congestion in advance by training the machine learning models with the collected historical data. the second proposed approach is a real time reactive approach which is using different meta-heuristics and compare them together to find the near optimal solution for traffic light cycle time.","internet of things, neural network, fuzzy logic system","In this paper, two approaches have been proposed in order to tackle road congestion issue, one of the promising research areas is to design dynamic algorithms to control the traffic lights. With the advent of machine learning, a lot of applications with huge data used machine learning algorithms to have a data-driven decisions. These decisions would have a direct/positive impact on improving the quality of life, revenues for companies, quality of service for the services provided for the end users, etc. In this paper, we used two well-known deep learning techniques, namely, RNN and LSTM and compare them with other machine learning algorithms to perform road congestion prediction. It has been shown in the results section that our proposed algorithms outperform other machine learning algorithms in terms of convergence rate, loss values and coefficient of determination factor. Many hyper parameters have been tuned to give us the best possible results in a reasonable amount of time. In the future, we have introduced an architecture which will be responsible to find near-optimal solution for the green time assigned to each traffic light with an objective to minimize the waiting time for each user in the road network. This meta-heuristic optimization algorithm will take benefit from the output of the first proposed work, which stores the predicted congestion at each traffic light in a separate database. The usage of meta-heuristic optimization has been justified because of the complexity of the defined problem, which is considered as an NP-Hard problem.

57,Energy Transition And Environmental Benefit Of Fuel Cell  Electric Vehicles,"since the world is constantly generating electricity, we need a means to store any excess energy that we get, so as to not waste any of it. surplus renewable energy can be stored in the form of hydrogen. this stored energy can be used in different applications like fuel cell electric vehicles, power generation, fertilizers and other chemical industries. energy production as hydrogen through water electrolysis has been getting massive attention in the world as the excessive renewable entry on their energy grid. the aim of this paper is to provide information about the production of hydrogen and the countries which are shifting towards green hydrogen in the world, and to calculate the environmental benefits of fuel cell electric vehicles (fcev) when they use the hydrogen that is being produced with the surplus renewable energy in canada.","hydrogen, renewable energy","Currently, the world is shifting towards becoming as emission-free as possible by finding any way to cut down on GHG emissions into the atmosphere. We have looked at various countries researching and developing their own renewable-energy generation facilities with the aim of having a greener society. One of the more recent findings is storing surplus energy in the form of hydrogen, which we can use for different applications. Our calculations have found that if we use the hydrogen generated in Canada by such means in Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles. The amount of CO2-eq emissions saved in tons as compared to typical Electric Vehicle being charged by conventional grids is 455, 500, 910,000, 2,293,200, 4,004,000, and 7,280,000 in the years 2020, 2025, 2030, 2035, and 2040, respectively. As such, by switching to FCEVs, we can reduce GHG emissions significantly; and thus, our move to a cleaner and safer environment becomes positively attainable.","muhammad nadeem akram and walid abdul-kader mechanical, automotive, and materials engineering department university of windsor, windsor, ontario, canada akram113@uwindsor.ca, kader@uwindsor.ca",
58,Evaluating The Factors Contributing To Unethical Practices  By Quantity Surveyors In Nigerian Construction Industry,"ethics are moral principles that direct or influence peoples’ attitude and conduct. it also has an incontrovertible impact on legitimacy and value standard of any profession. however, there has been lots of questions raised on low level of ethical standard among quantity surveyors in nigeria. due to the development, this study aims to identify and analyze factors contributing to unethical conduct among quantity surveyors in the construction industry. well-structured questionnaire covering the various factors contributing to unethical behavior by quantity surveyors were administered to the construction professionals. 228 legitimate reactions were retrieved and analyzed using mean item score (mis) and factor analysis (fa) respectively. it was revealed from the study that excessive love for money (greed), salaries of workers are delay and economic downturn were the top three factors contributing to unethical conduct by quantity surveyors in the construction industry. furthermore, factor analysis was employed in reducing these factors to six major contributing factors. thus, the study recommended that there should be total enforcement of the code of conduct on quantity surveyors by the professional bodies. results from this study give adequate confirmation and helpful pointers in clarifying some misinterpretations about factors contributing to unethical conduct by quantity surveyors in the construction industry and possible solution.","unethical, factor analysis, construction",,"akinrata ebunoluwa bimbola department of quantity surveying ahmadu bello university zaria, nigeria akinrataebun@gmail.com ayotunde anthony babalola department of quantity surveying, federal polytechnic ado-ekiti, nigeria ayobabs27@gmail.com ayo lahanmi estimating department mears group, inc., lenexa, kansas, usa ayo.lahanmi@mears.net ayodeji oke and bodunde funmilayo iyabo department of quantity surveying federal university of technology akure, nigeria emayok@gmail.com and fjdaramola@yahoo.com",
59,Application Of Ant Colony Optimizer (Aco) For Effective  Path Planning In A Big-Box Store Or Retail Facility,"real-life stochastic problems are better addressed by adopting metaheuristic techniques. one of the interesting metaheuristic techniques for defining the shortest path is the ant colony optimization (aco) algorithm. a considerable number of maps for shortest path have been considered in time past using classical techniques which is appropriate for deterministic variables. for stochastic or nondeterministic decision variables, metaheuristic techniques are much more appropriate. this is possible by mimicking the path navigation and swarm propensities of natural entities to provide real-time quality geographical images representing diverse areas or terrain for easy access to routing and path planning for sustainability and economic benefits in systems. in this research, the solution power of aco has been demonstrated to predict customers’ behaviour in a popular retail outlet, using the travelling salesman problem (tsp) for stochastic shortest path during the purchase of items in a big-box facility with multiple products and sixteen (16) sections. data obtained from the facility has been validated. the tour length was subjected to pheromone optimization to obtain a pheromone update of 0.00345 per metre as the maximum and 0.001725 as the best update at varying evaporation rate. in conclusion, out of the selected sections, two major paths in the big-box facility yielded optimal tour length and as such either of the paths can be followed by customers to spend the minimum required time in the facility.",routing,,"modestus o. okwu, tartibu k. lagouge department of mechanical and industrial engineering, university of johannesburg, south africa. mechanicalmodestus@yahoo.com, ltartibu@uj.ac.za modestus o. okwu, justice o. afenogho department of mechanical engineering, federal university of petroleum resources effurun, delta state, nigeria afenoghojustice@gmail.com,","References

61,Optimization Of Plantation In Various Countries Using A  Dynamic Model Approach,the forestry and plantation sectors are always experiencing developments every year. this development was carried out with the aim of obtaining sustainable productivity. sustainable productivity will provide stable natural resources as raw material or food for the benefit of human life. one of the steps taken to obtain sustainable productivity is by replanting. replanting activities need to be carried out to maintain the output from plantations and forestry to survive in order to meet high demand. dynamic modelling is needed to provide an overview of the optimal form of replanting for the expected sustainability of productivity. this research will discuss the use of dynamic models in various parts of the country to model replanting activities in the forestry and plantation sectors. each dynamic model used in this research still requires calibration to obtain high accuracy values. this will be an encouragement for researchers and management of the forestry and plantation sectors to obtain dynamic models with high accuracy values.,"dynamic, model, plantation, forestry","Dynamic models for the plantation and forestry sectors are always developing from time to time. Recent research is always carried out to test existing models in order to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the model. The purpose of developing the model is of course to get results that are closest to the real form that occurs in the field. The smaller the error value of the model, the greater the opportunity for management to make improvements and also to develop the plantation and forestry sectors.

62,The Impact Of Customer Focused Innovative Technologies  On Passenger Growth For A Domestic Low-Cost Carrier,"the technological innovations that are increasingly available to air travel have significantly grown over the years since the deregulation of the airline industry within south africa and the african continent. within the low cost carrier sector of the airline industry, the competition is tough and longevity of the low cost airline is prompted by the innovative ideas that direct customers to the “no frills” sector of air travel. this research study aims to determine the impact of customer focused innovative technology implementations on the passenger numbers of a low cost carrier airline in south africa. the research focuses on one domestic low cost carrier known to be technologically forward thinking and consistently uses advanced technology in the competitive market within which it operates. an overview of the business models used by low cost carriers across the world is explored with a focus on the selected carrier in south africa. the data is time series in nature where the granger causality statistical model is employed to assess how the customer technology projects affect the customer numbers. the results indicate that there is a causal relationship over time between the implementation of technology and the growth of passenger numbers.",,"The main objective of the research was to determine if there was an impact of the customer focused technology projects on the growth of passenger numbers on Standard Air over the period under consideration. The passenger growth of Standard Air may be determined by various factors in the operational lifecycle of the airline. The research study took into account another variable which airlines use to deliberately target their customers, which are marketing campaigns. The marketing campaigns did not seem to have a positive impact on the growth of passenger numbers nor did they have a positive impact on the revenue growth. This suggested that from an operational perspective the efforts of the campaigns did not have an impact on improving the passenger booking numbers. It would have seemed that marketing campaigns would assist in improving passenger numbers. Over time there was a notable positive linear relationship of passenger growth and revenue. This stands to reason as the assumption is the more passengers that are booked on Standard Air the more the expected revenue. This assumption is also highlighted in the correlation matrix that shows that there was a very strong correlation between the passenger numbers and revenue.

The results show that the density of particle board ranges between 0.982-1.005 gr /cm3 (meets the requirements of SNI 03-0349-1989). The water absorption capacity of particleboard ranges from 0.683% to 1.77% (meets the requirements of SNI 15–2094–2000). The screw holding strength values range from 19 kg to 27 kg (not yet meeting the requirements of JIS A 5908-2003). The impact strength of particleboard ranges from 0.007 to 0.015. The factors of the amount of styrofoam in the matrix, fiber orientation, and the fiber compositions in the manufacture of the test specimens have a significant effect on the density, water absorption, screw holding strength, and impact test of earthquake-resistant particleboard. 2. The results of all physical test studies meet the existing SNI standards. Meanwhile, the mechanical test did not meet the standards because the fiber composition used in this study was only 30% of the total weight of the specimen tested. But on the other hand, the effort to use cornstalk fiber has other advantages, the use of cornstalk fiber and styrofoam has a positive impact on the environment because it uses wasted resources so that it can produce new materials and it is hoped that in the future it can overcome the problems of handling earthquakes in Indonesia. Future Work 1. It would beneficial to using the old age cornstalks fiber this related to the maturity of the fiber and the amount of fiber for every corn stalks 2. Avoid the bubbles formed during the process it would be effected the several tests 3. The drying temperature of the composites should not exceed 100 0C because the polyester matrix was thermosetting so that the board becomes softening. 4. It is necessary to carry out further tests such as bending tests, tensile tests, gas emission tests, and SEM, it would be necessary to collaborate work to civil engineering to test the construction of building structures of the material that potentially efficient new material to be used as a foundation, temporary shelter walls aftermath earthquake or can also be a permanent wall material specifically for earthquake-prone areas in Indonesia.","flora elvistia firdaus1*, rico andreansyah2 department of chemical engineering, jayabaya university jl.pulomas selatan kav 23, jakarta timur- 13210, indonesia flora_elvistia@yahoo.com, andreansyahricko@gmail.com",
67,Study Of Electromyography Sensor Attachment Locations  For Designing Of Smart-Fitness Clothing,"with the recent development of wearable technology and the untact society's advent due to covid-19, various home fitness activities were being activated. to reflect the needs of consumers, smart fitness clothing has been researched and developed. among them, the development of clothing that checks each muscle's status and activity based on the emg (electromyography) signals is slow because there are limitations in various engineering and clothing aspects. when the emg sensors are attached to the inside of the clothing, the sensor may not be correct in contact with the skin due to the body movements (joints and muscles), and thus accurate measurement may not be performed. the purpose of this study is to determine the optimal sensor position for each muscle group by attaching several sensors to each muscle, then analyzing the signals. emg electrodes were attached to 9 muscles (two in the upper arm, one in the chest, one in the abdomen, two in the back, two in the thigh, and one in the calf) in the body, and emg data were analyzed to find the best sensor attachment position. the amplitude, noise, and snr (signal to noise ratio) of emg signals were measured when performing an exercise to activate each muscle. as a result, it was possible to confirm the optimal emg sensing position for each muscle. it is expected that more accurate high- quality signals could be obtained in consideration of physical characteristics when developing smart fitness clothing.",muscle location,,"yong-ku kong, kyeong-hee choi, chae-won park, seoung-yeon kim, min-jung kim and min-uk cho* department of industrial engineering sungkyunkwan university 2066, seobu-ro, jangan-gu, suwon-si, gyeongi-do 16419, korea crayonmm@naver.com",
68,A Numerical Analysis Of Airflow Efficiency Of A Mine  Ventilation Aircrossing,"mine ventilation aircrossing is one of the most important equipments which is used in a mine ventilation system, especially in coal mining. when designing any mine ventilation system or network, it is important to estimate the local resistances of the ventilation system to plan for an effective and well-designed ventilation system. currently, no mathematical models or empirical formulas are available to estimate the shock loss effect associated with the aircrossings. the aircrossing analysis performed in this study was done through numerical analysis using commercial software ansys fluent 2019 r1. shock loss factors on an aircrossing were investigated numerically on various geometries. the computational fluid dynamics (cfd) model proposed, was validated using numerical results reported previously. the study indicates that the ansys numerical code is appropriate to evaluate shock losses in mine ventilation aircrossings. the research, therefore, has the potential to provide an important step towards, understanding flow patterns and shock losses effect at the aircrossing. this will assist in improving the design and selection of mine ventilation aircrossings, ventilation planning, and improve the working environment for underground mineworkers.","aircrossing, cfd, mine ventilation","In conclusion, this study shows that shock losses are primarily generated as a result of the configuration angle. The severity of shock loss depends on this angle, with minimum angles giving minimum energy losses to airflow. These pressure losses are used to calculate shock loss coefficients of aircrossings. To assist in the assessment of each case, the values of the shock loss coefficient of each aircrossing are determined. These variations and range of shock loss will limit and assist the design ventilation engineers in selecting an aircrossing that is effective and efficient with minimum flow separation and fewer shock losses. This can be achieved by selecting an aircrossing which gives a low shock loss coefficient.

69,Numerical Analysis Of Vertical Axis Wind Turbine  Performance At Varied Angle-Of-Attack,"a vertical axis wind turbine (vawt) is the type of turbine that uses aerodynamic drag to rotate vertically and generate electrical energy. wind energy is considered an important renewable energy source and the development of vawts is ever increasing. a household application of vawt as a complementary energy source is considered. the study focused on the analysis of the performance of vawts at varied blade angle-of-attack (aoa). two naca selig/giguere series aerofoils were modelled for varied thicknesses and chord lengths to analyze the power of the turbine at different aoa using computational fluid dynamics (cfd). a dynamic mesh technique in the ansys fluent 2019 r1 commercial software was used to model a three-h-shape vawt that simulated a varied aoa as cam would on pivoting blades was effected through a user-defined-function. the varying aoa produce a higher momentum deficit in the wake, but also a faster wake recovery. the aoa reaches both the minima and maxima of the power it can produce before stalling wind over the aerofoil and forming large vortex shedding and wakes behind each blade that should have been less from a low-speed vawt. consequently increasing noise levels which is undesirable for urban applications. the varied aoa show a bimodal distribution of vortex shedding retracting from the blades.","angle-of-attack, dynamic mesh, renewable energy","The potential use of varied angle-of-attack in VAWT and has been numerically investigated. The power coefficient Cp in VAWT is maximum at very low values of TSR (λ = 0.6). The results show that blade of SG6043 aerofoil with a chord length of, c = 0.5m yields the best energy capture in presence of varied or fixed angle-of-attack. The noise caused as demonstrated by the vortex sheet is noted but not fully modelled and analysed in this study. The observation is that the noise level and distribution is reduced on varied AoA of the blades. However, future work is needed to address the limitations of the current the study that includes range to revolutions of the turbine and for the azimuthal increment over 3600 revolutions. 5.","thokozani justin kunene mechanical & industrial engineering technology department university of johannesburg, doornfontein campus johannesburg, south africa tkunene@uj.ac.za mossa maculove mechanical & industrial engineering technology department university of johannesburg, doornfontein campus johannesburg, south africa 217012818@student.uj.ac.za lagouge kwanda tartibu mechanical & industrial engineering technology department university of johannesburg, doornfontein campus johannesburg, south africa ltartibu@uj.ac.za",

It will also benefit Cal Poly as they work to manage their blockchain as they will now have easier access and control over their supply chain database, will have more accessible means of record-keeping, and a simpler time connecting with the different entities. For the next steps, we recommend that Cal Poly Wine look into integrating one of the permissioned public blockchains discussed in this paper. This will allow Cal Poly Wine to improve their experience with managing and analyzing their Supply Chain data, as well as provide their consumers with a more reliable and extensive report on the wine they purchase.

can form a factor. Meanwhile, the extraction value is the percentage of the variance of a variable, which can be 
explained by the factors that will be created. For example, the easy extraction value variable shows a figure of 0.624 or

75,Lifetime Extension Of Distributed Power Networks By  Evaluating The Joint Gaussian Probabilities Of The Power,"to extend the lifetime of a distributed power network, that consists of several generators supplying several load centers, according to a joint gaussian probability distribution functions (pdf) of various random variables with estimated probabilities of source-load power coverage. the probability of any generator covering a load center is assumed to be readily known from statistical data. the nth order joint gaussian pdf of all generators to any load center is calculated according to variations in the value of the mean covered power. this procedure is expanded to all load centers with the assumption that they are independent. the overall joint pdf with probabilities above a certain threshold value, are selected in an algorithm to prolong whole network lifetime by removing redundancies in powering all generators in same time. the contributions of each generator in supplying overall network loads, are then estimated in an intuitive method according to the evaluated probabilities of each generator supplying whole network load. the lifetime extension is demonstrated in a case study example.","joint gaussian, lifetime extension","The lifetime of a network comprising a number of generators supplying the demand of several load centers, is increased by removing redundancies by activating only some of the generators with individual contributions, using a novel algorithm that calculates each generator probability of supplying the total load. In a case study of 3 generators supplying two load centers, the lifetime is increased by 190%. In this study, we calculate the joint Gaussian PDF of several assumed random probabilities of network elements, such as maintaining continuous supply probability, different fault probabilities, least cost probabilites, etc. that can readily be estimated from available statistical field data. It is noted that redundancies removal depends on the amount of variations considered in the mean values of the selected random variables. For every variation, redundancies are removed by selecting the maximum probabilities among the different combinations of generators’ combinations. Adequate values of variations are assumed for the same case study example, in which the average is used in the evaluation of the total joint Gaussian PDF. It is assumed that the joint probabilities of all generators to any load, are independent, and whereas cross multiplication of of all these probabilities is implemented in finding total or resultant probability, other methods can be used, such as calculating the minimum joint probabilities in 2 or 3-dimensional space.","coverage of generators to load centers demand amir j. majid, ph.d. college of engineering and information technology university of science and technology of fujairah fujairah, 2202, uae a.abdulmajid@ustf.ac.ae",
76,A Proposed Model Of Virtual Clustering Of Organizations  And Its Relationship To Supply Chain Competitiveness,"supply chain collaboration is cross enterprise and can be vertical and/or horizontal. vertical supply chain collaboration involves collaboration and coordination with customers and suppliers whilst horizontal collaboration involves collaboration with competitors, government institutions and other important stakeholders. it is generally accepted that supply chain collaboration leads to competitive advantage. whilst a lot of literature has been published that shows the importance of both horizontal and vertical supply chain collaboration in enhancing competitive advantage, very few studies have focused on the factors that influence successful virtual collaboration and the achievement of competitive advantage due to supply chain virtual collaboration. this paper proposes a conceptual model that attempts to close this gap utilizing the concept of virtual clustering.",virtual clustering,"Having reviewed both the organizational clustering literature and supply chain literature the model in Figure 1 seems to have a potential to move the current knowledge and understanding in virtual inter organisational collaboration forward. This is achieved by addressing both issues of what makes virtual organizational clustering and technologically driven supply chain collaboration relationships successful. Such collaborations involve both vertical supply chain (buyer-supplier and supplier-customer relationships) and horizontal supply chain (university- industry relationships and government-industry relationships). This research will also advance the debate on organizational clustering paradigm, which has traditionally focused only on geographic space, especially as technology shrinks the world into a small global space. This research will proceed into the next stage which will operationalize the model proposed in Figure 1 and test the necessary hypotheses in comparison with the traditional clustering concepts.","robert monageng mechanical engineering department university botswana gaborone, botswana department of industrial and systems engineering university of pretoria pretoria, south africa monagengr@ub.ac.bw olufemi adetunji department of industrial and systems engineering university of pretoria pretoria, south africa olufemi.adetunji@up.ac.za",

80,Optimal Siting Of Interconnected Mini-Grid In Electricity  Distribution Network Using Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Analytic,"siting an interconnected mini-grid project within an electricity distribution network requires a thorough investigation of alternative locations to determine where the solution is optimally required and guarantees quick returns on investment. this study employs location attributes and lifetime value of electricity consumers as decision-making criteria for determining an optimal location for a proposed project. the location attributes criteria are consumer population, hours of supply, and energy consumption, while lifetime value criteria are profit and cost. the paper utilizes an interval type-2 fuzzy analytic hierarchy process as a multi-criteria decision-making methodology for the investigation. the study carried out a pairwise comparison of criteria using the experts’ opinion survey to determine the criteria weights. the study developed location attributes-based model (labm) and lifetime value model (ltvm) to obtain the weighted value of each alternate location. the cumulative values of labm and ltvm are used in ranking the alternate locations to determine the optimal location for the interconnected mini-grid siting within an electricity distribution network. this model is recommended for interconnected mini-grid projects decision-making as utility company embraces embedded electricity generation to bridge the supply gap created by the epileptic national grid.",,"Location Attributes-Based Model (LABM) and Lifetime Value Model (LTVM) developed in this study is recommended for quick decision making on the optimal siting of interconnected mini-grid. It will be a willing tool for mini-grid investors, utility companies, international development agencies when swift decision-making is required for the interconnected mini-grid project. The use of LABM and LTVM to obtain the weighted values of criteria in determining the optimal siting of interconnected mini-grid is faster than the investment-based site selection model developed by Akinlabi and Oladokun (2020). The volume of data required is lesser and easily available, unlike similar models. The model is remarkable for its swiftness in decision making for the optimal location for a mini-grid. One of the limitations of this study is that other factors like the infrastructural investment required, collection efficiency, customer tariff classification, technical, commercial, and collection losses were not considered due to difficulties in getting their data from the utility company. Future studies can employ other multi-criteria decision-making techniques and compare the outcome with the result of this study.","hierarchy process akintunde k. akinlabi department of industrial and production engineering university of ibadan, ibadan nigeria tundelabi@yahoo.com victor o. oladokun department of industrial and production engineering university of ibadan, ibadan nigeria vo.oladokun@mail1.ui.edu.ng","references

82,The Effect   Of Green Human Resources Management,"the coronavirus pandemic (covid-19) has become a severe health problem for the world community. the massive transmission has made covid-19 a disease that is both frightening and deadly. person-to-person transmission of the covid-19 infection has made hospitals more vulnerable to transmission of the virus and infection to workers and patients who come. during the covid-19 pandemic, hospitals have become the most visited places for examination and treatment. in this condition, it is necessary to manage human resources that pay attention to environmental aspects and protection to maintain service quality. green human resources management is a suitable system for managing hospital hr during a pandemic so that the hospital can still provide and maintain good service quality. this research was conducted during the covid-19 pandemic to answer the gap in hospital research previously in seeing the effect of green hrm on service quality. the service quality concept is used in the healthcare service industry to test its application in indonesia's state-owned hospitals. this study uses a data analysis method with the variance based structural equation modeling technique by utilizing smartpls software to process data on 1004 respondents from workers from 19 state-owned enterprises (soe) hospitals throughout indonesia.","green hrm, service quality, soe hospitals","The link between implementing Green HRM policies and practices lies in the importance of service quality that can provide customer satisfaction. On this basis, this study proves the hypothesis of the effect of the Green HRM relationship on positive and significant service quality. During the COVID-19 Pandemic, the level of difficulty in providing health services was higher than average. It makes this happen; it is necessary to involve employees and provide employees with the competencies needed (Haynes & Fryer, 2000). Most service sectors have linked HR strategy with HR practices to reinvent customer service activities to achieve customer satisfaction. In this context, HR strategies and procedures, including practices in the service sector, can support service quality. The application of Green HRM practices that have been developed over several decades answers the question that the management of Green HRM is suitable for the context of improving service quality (Sheehan, 2005). Effectively by managing human resources, service companies can develop the types of employee behavior that are important for the success of the company's competitive strategy, especially when providing service quality to their customers (Huang, 2001). Some selected HR practices, such as workplace support, training, reward systems, and performance appraisals, in turn, will also be closely related and affect service quality. Previous research will reinforce conducted by Solha Husin et al. (2012). Besides, the implementation of Green HRM practices and policies identified by management is essential for the success of the strategy and the influence of employee commitment and competence so that it can positively influence service quality. 6. Implications This research has implications for theoretical thinking and enrichment in management, notably the Green HRM study of service quality in hospitals. For hospital management, this research will help create policies and models related to environmentally friendly human resource management to improve hospitals' quality of services through Green HRM. This research also contributes to a further research agenda by building theoretical models. 7. Limitations And Suggestions Future research can adopt research methods and dig deeper into various theories that can be applied later. For a more in-depth understanding, further research can examine service quality changes due to all stakeholders' Green HRM influence over a more extended period. The research population is also limited to employees so that service quality is viewed from a self-assessment and supply-side perspective. Future research can be carried out across all hospital stakeholders by involving a larger population. Further research can also be carried out in other service industries by adapting this research to different locations and cultures. Suggestions to prevent more health workers from becoming infected, with the implementation of Green HRM in human resource management, it is necessary to continuously carry out COVID-19 tests for health workers and periodically to ensure and build confidence, which has an impact on improving the quality of service to patients. Also, providing complete personal protective equipment according to unique hospital standards for preventing infectious and infected diseases and providing unique changing rooms that can sterilize germs and bacteria from health workers who will and after work. 8.","on service quality in the pandemic time of covid-19 on hospitals state-owned enterprise the republic of indonesia asep saifudin student of the mercu buana university doctoral program, jakarta, indonesia asepsaifudin1769@gmail.com m. havidz aima professor and head of the doctoral program at mercu buana university, jakarta, indonesia haviz.aima@yahoo.com achmad hidayat sutawidjaya and sugiyono postgraduate lecturer at mercu buana university, jakarta indonesia a.h.sutawijaya@mercubuana.ac.id, sugiyono.madelan@mercubuana.ac.id",

Based on the research that has been done, researchers provide suggestions for further researchers, namely as follows: a. The next researcher can focus on research using a questionnaire, in further research can use the interview method with respondents so that the information obtained can be more detailed and in- depth. b. Because this research uses only one independent variable, it is hoped that it can conduct research with other variables to add research variables related to e-satisfaction and e-service quality to make it more developed and varied.","aditya wardhana telkom university jalan terusan buah batu, bandung 40257, indonesia adityawardhana@telkomuniversity.ac.id budi rustandi kartawinata telkom university jalan terusan buah batu, bandung 40257, indonesia budikartawinata@telkomuniversity.ac.id diki wahyu nugraha prodi/jurusan d4 teknik informatika politeknik pos indonesia jln. sari asih no. 54, 40151 bandung, jawa barat, indonesia dikiambrose1@gmail.com iqbal firmansyah trisakti school of transportation management, indonesia jakarta, indonesia galang tegar prahara telkom university jalan terusan buah batu, bandung 40257, indonesia",
84,Innovation As Part Of The Strategy For Microbusinesses  During Covid-19,"the spanish flu had a direct effect on the gdp, and it served as a perfect benchmark to anticipate the outcomes and implications of covid-19 on the economy. multiple waves of layoffs, permanent business closures, social unrest, and the virus's extended duration had devastating effects on the economy. government funding in the form of ppp (paycheck protection program), cares (coronavirus aid relief and economic security act), and state-funded grants for small businesses are just a few examples of reliefs injected into the economy to help small businesses. however, these initiatives had little effect in helping the financially fragile small businesses. the purpose of this paper is to discuss the effects of covid-19 on micro-businesses in the service industry and provide innovative industry practices and ideas that have helped micro-businesses remain open during the pandemic. this paper aims to promote innovative knowledge and practices for managers to implement during the pandemic to keep the business open and operational. this quantitative research included almost 5562 micro-businesses surveyed between may 1st and august 30th, 2020, along with extensive relevant literature research in this field. the main question aimed to be answered: have innovative processes been successful in helping micro-businesses stay operational and open during the pandemic. the six dimensions of innovation of hertog, den, and de jong (2010) were utilized to define innovative processes and procedures that micro-businesses can implement. data findings in this research indicate that micro-businesses need to implement out of the box innovative thinking for providing their services to customers to stay operational and avoid permanent closure.","covid-19, microbusinesses, ppp act, cares act",,"yara a. elkhalil department of management and international management colorado state university – global campus greenwood village, co 80111 yara.elkhalil@csuglobal.edu",
85,Reflection Of The Virtual Learning Environment                     In The Covid-19 Pandemic Period,"virtual learning was widely used during the covid-19 pandemic. this situation shows that technology-based learning has been able to overcome the limitations of space and time. this learning has become a solution to educational problems during the covid-19 pandemic. however, from virtual learning, there are still complaints among teachers and students about the effectiveness of virtual learning. the problem in this study is the obstacle in virtual-based learning in the new normal era. the aim of this research is to analyze the constraints of virtual learning in the new normal era. 30 teachers and 50 students who have conducted virtual learning interactions are used as subjects in this study. these obstacles were identified by interview and questionnaire techniques. furthermore, the data obtained were analyzed using a qualitative descriptive approach and using the concept of learning and learning theory. based on the research results, it was found that virtual learning constraints still occur in various elements of learning, such as problems with teachers, learning media, teaching materials, learning evaluation, and learning interactions. so, it is still necessary to develop various aspects of learning, such as teacher teaching creativity, media and learning materials, as well as a good internet network.","virtual learning, learning problems, covid-19","Based on a literature review and research results, it can be concluded that virtual-based learning still has many problems and obstacles. These problems and obstacles are found in various aspects of learning, such as teachers, students, media or virtual learning applications, and in learning interactions. So it still needs to be updated and adjusted from various aspects. 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 Sangat efektif Efektif Kurang efektif Tidak efektif Proceedings of the 2nd African International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management Harare, Zimbabwe, December 7-10, 2020","haerul, andoyo sastramiharjo, vismaia s. damaianti, yeti mulyati dapartement of indonesian language education indonesian education university bandung, indonesia haerul@upi.edu, andoyo@upi.edu, vismaia@upi.edu, yetimulyati@upi.edu","References

88,The Effect Of Compensation And Transformational  Leadership On Job Satisfaction Mediated With Job,"this research aimed to examine and to analyze the effect of compensation and transformational leadership on job satisfaction, either directly or indirectly. it was also mediated with job motivation variable and the effect of job motivation on employees’ job motivation in muhammadiyah hospital of lamongan (thereafter called rsml). this study was explanatory research, in which the analysis method employed was partial least square (pls) by evaluating structural model (inner model) and measurement model (outer model). the population of the research consisted of 364 employees of muhammadiyah hospital of lamongan, while the sample consisted of 79 employees, obtained using the slovin technique. overall, the finding showed that compensation and transformational leadership are the fundamental instruments underlying muhammadiyah hospital of lamongan in improving the employees’ job motivation and satisfaction.","compensation, job satisfaction, 2018)","Overall, the result of the research shows that compensation and transformational leadership are the fundamental instruments underlying Muhammadiyah Hospital of Lamongan in improving its employees’ job motivation and satisfaction. Giving reasonable compensation and transformational leadership style application play important role in improving job satisfaction either directly or indirectly through job motivation. Good job motivation can generate the employees’ satisfaction with job. In addition, job motivation is determined as partial mediation to the effect of compensation and transformational leadership on job satisfaction which means that without job motivation, compensation and transformational leadership practices can improve job satisfaction directly, and the presence of job motivation escalates the increase in the employees’ feeling of satisfaction with the company. Some practical recommendations are given to Muhammadiyah Hospital of Lamongan (RSML) considering the findings of the research. They are benefit giving and inspirational motivation by the leader of RSML as the key factor to reinforce compensation and transformational leadership, thereby, can improve the employees’ working spirit and their job satisfaction. Further researchers are recommended to add the indicator of compensation to make the result of the research more comprehensive. The object of next research should be expanded to the manufacturing industry sector to draw a broader conclusion (generalization).","motivation umar yeni suyanto1, mu’ah2, elliv hidayatul lailiyah3 and ika purwanti4 taxation and management department stie kh. ahmad dahlan lamongan east of java, indonesia umarsuyanto@gmail.com1, mama.stiead@gmail.com2, ellivhidayatullailiyah@gmail.com3, ikapoer2@gmail.com4",
89,Distribution Of Day Fish In Ternate City Water Based On  Chlorophyll-A,"proceedings of the 2nd african international conference on industrial engineering and operations management harare, zimbabwe, december 7-10, 2020 © ieom society international 1062",,"Production of flying fish (Catching of Decaoterus spp) in the waters of Ternate City during the research tends to fluctuate every month during the study period. In this study, it was found the main factor that causes fluctuation results of this catch is Ocean waves All activities related to marine are very sensitive to any changes that occur at sea, these environmental parameters will affect fish dispersal, migration, aggregation, spawning and food supply as well as fish behavior. Fluctuations in the value of chlorophyll-a concentrations in the waters of Ternate City are closely related to the abundance of phytoplanton, where chlorophyll-a is a pigment contained in phytoplankton cells (mainly diatoms) which causes the distribution of chlorophyll-a to follow the pattern of phytoplanton abundance, where chlorophyll-a is a pigment contained in phytoplankton cells (mainly diatoms) which causes the distribution of chlorophyll-a horizontal distribution of the abundance of phytoplankton itself. The results of the polynomial regression analysis showed that there was a close relationship between the catches of flying fish with the concentration distribution chlorophyll-a with the catch and the concentration value of chlorophyll-a. It means 73.15% of the presence of flying fish in Ternate Island waters is influenced by the chlorophyll-a concentration value by assuming that the value of other oceanographic parameters is constant. So, The distribution of chlorophyll-a concentration parameters in the waters of Ternate Island in October 2018 to February 2019 is in the range of 0.2-0.5 mg / m3 with an average value of 0.24 mg / m3, where the value of this concentration has a significant effect on fish catches elevated with a correlation coefficient of 0.86 in exponential regression.","syahnul sardi titaheluw department of fisheries product technology, faculty of agriculture muhammadiyah university north maluku, ternate city, north maluku province, indonesia titaheluw@gmail.com umar tangke department of fisheries product technology, faculty of agriculture muhammadiyah university north maluku, ternate city, north maluku province, indonesia umbakhaka@gmail.com aisyah bafagih department of fisheries product technology, faculty of agriculture muhammadiyah university north maluku, ternate city, north maluku province, indonesia aisyahbfagih@gmail.com raismin kotta faculty of mipa, muhammadiyah university north maluku. ternate city, north maluku province, indonesia ruslanlaisouw@gmail.com ruslan laisow departement of fisheries recources utilization, faculty of marine science and fisheries, university of pattimura, ambon, indonesia dusyanfrentje79@gmail.com frentje dusyan silooy department of fisheries recources utilization, faculty of agriculture, university of khairun, ternate, indonesia chikar19@gmail.com fikri rizky malik ternate field research station, center for oceanographic recearch indonesian institute of sciences, ternate city, north maluku province, indonesia fikririzkym@gmail.com arson batilambu student of the department of fisheries product technology, faculty of agriculture. muhammadiyah university north maluku, ternate city, north maluku province, indonesia arsonbatilambu@gmail.com",

97,A Cost Analysis Of A Biomass Supply Chain For Sustainable  Aviation Fuel In South Africa,"the aviation industry has experienced high growth in recent years and is projected to continue to increase rapidly in the future. as a result, it is also one of the world’s fastest growing sources of greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions. whilst this industry has focused on fuel and operational efficiency, more still needs to be done to further limit the negative impact it is having on the planet. sustainable aviation fuel (saf) is being investigated as an alternative fuel and uses sources like biomass, which have lower ghg emissions. in south africa, there exists an opportunity for organic waste and invasive alien plants (iaps) to be used as a biomass source for saf. however, no research on the establishment of a supply chain for using biomass to produce saf in this country could be located. a supply chain design and cost analysis was undertaken to ascertain whether biomass, to produce saf, is feasible in south africa",biomass,"Due to the high and increasing GHG emissions from the aviation industry, which is detrimental to the environment, an alternative fuel with a less negative impact on the environment needed to be investigated. This involved investigating a fuel derived from biomass, namely, Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). In order to gauge whether SAF was a viable alternative to conventional aviation fuel, an investigation into a biomass supply chain needed to be completed. South Africa displayed several biomass types that could be harvested for SAF, but this supply chain would need to be understood, designed, costed and compared to the coal supply chain cost. To properly compare the biomass supply chain to the coal supply chain, the harvested biomass (which had very low calorific values) would need to be processed into a form that exhibited calorific values that were closer to that of coal. This process was densification and involved compressing chipped/shredded biomass into wood pellets. Three types of pelletized products supply chains were analysed, namely white pellets, black pellets and fuel rods for a conservative biomass availability scenario and an optimistic biomass scenario. This involved completing analyses for 20 different processes separately for the conservative and optimistic scenario. Fuel rods with sieving came out to be the most feasible option across both scenarios but did not have enough supply to meet the maximum required demand of 5 000 000 tonnes per annum. This, coupled with the relatively new technology of fuel rods, made white pellets, sieving with project shredding the next best option. The optimal biomass supply cost curves were over 600% more expensive than the coal supply cost curve. Based on this alone, it can be ascertained that the biomass supply chain is indeed infeasible. However, the biomass supply chain costs could be further reduced if the COG analysis was run again, with the towns with rail sidings as priority, as some rail sidings were more affordable than road transport. Furthermore, the need for GHG emission reduction and the imposed carbon tax liability could make the biomass supply chain for SAF viable. This, coupled with the fact that SAF is created from a renewable feedstock; is categorized as a drop-in fuel, which can be blended with conventional aviation fuel to varying degrees with no impact on the infrastructure whilst still meeting the aviation’s industry safety and quality requirements would make SAF a serious consideration in future. It is therefore recommended that further investigations pertaining to the negative financial impact that carbon tax liability will have on the aviation industry as well as the potential price that SAF could yield considering the Proceedings of the 2nd African International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management Harare, Zimbabwe, December 7-10, 2020","shivani sooklal school of mechanical, industrial and aeronautical engineering university of the witwatersrand johannesburg, south africa shivanisooklal@gmail.com bernadette sunjka school of mechanical, industrial and aeronautical engineering university of the witwatersrand johannesburg, south africa bernadette.sunjka1@wits.ac.za","References

The proposal to implement a cryptocurrency as compared to the cash environment was propelled by the realization of how paying of fees by students is undeniably inefficient, costly and time-consuming. Moreover, the growth in the number of students studying in higher educational institutions which always results in long stressful queues and extreme overcrowding in most financial institutions when paying student fees. With the introduction of Covid-19, the situation for financial institutions and students is not favourable. Students are to use the proposed payment system to pay tuition fees and other student fees to their respective higher educational institution. In addition, students are to use the proposed payment to pay for goods and services provided by the institution and other merchants in the institution's premises. This would evidently reduce and to some extent eliminate cash handling by students, financial and education institution. This study was restricted by the lack of design and creation of a mobile application based on iOS or Android that would allow students to communicate with the blockchain. In order to promote interoperability between the proposed system and telecommunications firms, banks and microfinance institutions, a field for further studies would include the design and implementation of a RESTful API.","learning institutions chimuka moonde, jackson phiri computer science department university of zambia lusaka, p.o. box 32379, zambia 2018248898@student.unza.zm, jackson.phiri@cs.unza.zm",
100,Assessment Of Mentoring On Retention Of Workers And  Human Resource Management In The Construction Sector: A,"(12 font) mentoring is experiencing renaissance because business leaders not only identify the benefits of transferring knowledge among workers. although mentoring theory, research and practice have begun to be developed, quite few articles on mentoring, retention have appeared in the human resource development literature. the purpose of this paper is to look at research and practice on mentoring through the lens of human resource development in the construction industry, to discover gaps in what is known about mentoring that are significant to human resource development specialists and furthermore the study describes better practices that organizations can use to resolve the threat of lost knowledge caused by changing workforce demographics. the data used in the study was mainly qualitative, based on the historical data. the review enabled the road map to source out information related to human resource management and mentoring on retention of graduate’s workers in south africa. after reviewing core aspect of mentoring, central to all domains of human resource development, the authors summarize the key issues that had been studied regarding mentoring and career development, organization development, and training and development, proposing new direction for future research. the study also, indicated knowledge transfer assist workers in cultivating their skill sets which increases their marketability. individuals who had been mentored reported high levels of knowledge transfer.","mentoring, retention, construction","As changing demographics have inexorably rehabilitated the business landscape, it is generally accepted that organizations are currently dealing with the daunting task of replacing knowledgeable and talented workers. Furthermore, the consensus is that there has become a shortage of talent in the workforce and that companies will have to actively wage war for talent in order to get the right people with the right skills into their organizations. Retaining organizational knowledge in the face of changing workforce demographics is a complex challenge that requires simultaneously confronting the problems created by an aging workforce, the threats posed by changing demographics were not created in a year and will not be solved overnight. The most effective knowledge retention strategies will require a multifaceted approach and a long-term commitment on both the leadership of an organization and the employees. In this paper, the authors have reviewed current perspectives on mentoring and HRD and identified directions, gaps for future research, theory, and practice from the perspective of the HRD domains of career development, organization development, and training and development within construction organizations. Noteworthy strides have been made on mentoring research, theory, and practice providing a solid foundation on which to build the additional work that is needed to fully understand and maximize the effective use of mentoring. It seems that the issue of mentoring and human resource development in construction organizations can generally be considered as a good field of research and vast topics of research can be defined in this regard. Further research is suggested to inspect what, if any programs or practices help improve the present factors that HR personnel perceive to be fundamental to employee retention. Our study focused on our ideas on what may help improve employee retention, but it did not address their ideas. In particular, research is recommended to determine how best organizations (those with the lowest turnover) can facilitate the meeting of employee needs and improve retention. Additionally, the current study does not directly assess all of the potential factors relevant to employee retention, but uses the preconceived ideas of the researcher. In too many cases the answer “other” was used indicating that perhaps a wider number of potential factors should be included in the analysis.","literature review morena william nkomo and wellington didibhuku thwala department of construction management and quantity surveying university of johannesburg johannesburg. rsa mnkomo@uj.ac.za, didibhukut@uj.ac.za clinton ohis aigbavboa department of construction management and quantity surveying university of johannesburg johannesburg. rsa caigbavboa@uj.ac.za",

104,Competencies In The Digitalized Working Environment: A  Concept For Engineering Education In Higher Education,"in the contemporary working environment, industry 4.0 concepts and technologies offer a multitude of possibilities to increase productivity and, therefore, the long-term success of industrial companies and small and medium-sized enterprises, as well. in this context, the systematic development of digital competencies is a major success factor of modern industrial engineering education in higher education institutions. therefore, this paper reflects the theoretical concept of competencies within modern educational approaches, e.g., ‘education 4.0’ in europe, with a special emphasis on digital competencies. moreover, the authors present the design of the course ‘logistics system engineering and material flow management’ to illustrate the implementation and application of digital technologies in university teaching. the module-based concept should further be used as a reference for the realignment of engineering lectures in higher education institutions to contribute to the professionalization of industrial engineering education. 1 introduction in today's transformation society, the teaching of relevant and up-to-date skills is indispensable and represents a central element of the european pillar of social rights (eps, 2020). thus, high-quality education should be made available to all people, so that they can actively and self-confidently make a significant contribution as citizens regarding further development and ongoing innovation. the european competence agenda of the european commission (2016) makes it clear that europe has a lot of catching up to do in this respect since around 70 million people are neither able to read and write properly, nor do arithmetic, nor do they have digital skills and are, therefore, at risk of poverty, unemployment or social exclusion. the demand here lies in fundamental reforms of education systems and their orientation toward future-oriented knowledge, skills, and competencies ‘adapted to the digital age’ (euco14/17, 2017). since technological progress (","robotics, iot","In this paper, the authors identified modern industrial engineering education in higher education institutions as a major success factor within the framework of Industry 4.0 concepts and approaches. Thereby, a special focus should be placed on the systematic development of digital competencies to ensure an ongoing professionalization of the industrial engineering profession. Based on recent theories of competencies and competence development, this paper has introduced a module-based concept for the course of ‘logistics system design and material flow management’ by using a set of online and offline teaching and learning methods combined with interactive case studies, online sessions, augmented reality demonstrations, and discrete event simulation tools. In this context, future research should focus on the investigation of holistic competence-profiles in the context of industrial engineering education in higher education institutions for the engineers of tomorrow. New teaching and learning methods are needed to enable students to acquire the necessary transversal skills for the post-industrialized world. Higher education must provide future experts with future-oriented knowledge, skills, and competencies for maintaining competitiveness and strengthening the European economy. For all students, especially those in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) subjects, the acquisition of extensive cross-sectional and key- competencies is a major success factor. 6 Acknowledgments The project ‘SME 4.0 – Industry 4.0 for SMEs’ has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under the Marie Skłodowska- Curie grant agreement No. 734713.

106,Impact Of The Integrated Management System On Business Strategy:  Critical Success And Failure Factors,"organisations in recent years have opted for an integrated management system (ims), especially in quality, environmental, and occupational health and safety, which by design are generally considered to be compatible or rather easier to integrate. ims is intended to consolidate the resources of the organisation in terms of people, documentation, auditing, compliance, etc. and as such it reduces costs and brings focus to the business. however, the downside is that the implementation process is not a “same fit for all”, but rather each situation is dependent on many factors including the state of readiness of the organisation, its size, maturity level of individual management systems and support from the executive management. despite the rise in the number of organisations that have implemented the ims in the last number of years, problems related to integration difficulties and lack of alignment with business strategy still exist. this paper presents a practical perspective of the challenges and critical factors concerning the implementation of the ims in a fast- moving consumer goods (fmcg) business, which by its nature is susceptible to quality, environmental, and safety risks due to its high speed of operation.",iso 9001,,"zithobile patrick toyo and nelson sizwe madonsela department of quality and operations management university of johannesburg corner kingsway and university road, auckland park, south africa patrick.toyo@tigerbrands.com; nmadonsela@uj.ac.za","REFERENCES

109,Accessing Production Machinery Technology Flexibility  Potential,"machine control systems have experienced a paradigm shift, from centralized computer numeric control to automatic control. the question, how can the manufacturing industry access the technology flexibility potential available to the industry class? is answered by the adaptive capabilities inherent to technology-based flexibility. the objective of this research paper is to distill and develop a process that can render a manufacturing process flexible, based on the technology of the manufacturing system. the approach will offer a view that is in contrast with the widely held scientific management principles. technology flexibility is the capacity for a manufacturing process to take action when required to meet new system requirements, whether intended or unexpectedly occurring. this paper declares that the system flexibility value is an inherent advantage of manufacturing system’s technology. a qualitative research approach is adopted to explore and explain how the manufacturing system can be modelled to access its flexibility potential. key words: flexibility; technology; manufacturing; scientific; automation proceedings of the 2nd african international conference on industrial engineering and operations management harare, zimbabwe, december 7-10, 2020 © ieom society international 1247",,"(12 font) Attribute of flexibility, such as multi-skilling labor, which is a manifestation of division of labor, are critical for the emancipation of firms to flexible production system. For example, multi-skilling implies acquisition of skills that cut across functions and, therefore in environments in which product variety and speed require fluid response, multi- skilling overcomes the rigidities that set in from the division of labor (Adler, 1988). To the extent that the flexibility of the firm’s production system is constraint by its most rigid part, firms will not access their flexibility potential even if they were to employ flexible manufacturing technologies (Košťál et al., 2010). Therefore, for firms to realize their flexibility potential, design principles that are different from the scientific management principles must be employed and production systems must be designed to abandon hierarchical modes of command and control and facilitate parallel processing. Most importantly, production systems must be designed to foster a learning environment in which the system is able evolve incrementally from initial inputs.","ngaka mosia department of mechanical and industrial engineering university of south africa florida, gauteng, south africa mosian@unisa.ac.za",
110,Analyzing Human Errors Responsible For A Pressure Vessel  Failure,"in the era of technological advancement it is still critical to analyze human errors that are responsible for failures of pressure vessels. this is because the adoption of latest technologies cannot totally or abruptly displace the role played by human in design, fabrication and maintenance of equipment including pressure vessels. thus, this paper adopted a case study research methodology aimed at examining human errors and their causal factors responsible for pressure vessel failure. the analysis feedback established that the slip error in original design contributed to the pressure vessel leak. furthermore, the design error served as a latent error in the fabrication, inspection and maintenance process until the leak developed in the longitudinal weld of the shell. the lapse error and mistake due to the inadequacy of the repair or replacement procedure resulted in the partial re-fabrication of the shell with its original design error. this discussed the causal factors responsible for the identified human errors and then made recommendations to enhance design and repair or replacement processes so as to minimize human errors. this paper makes contribution by providing insights on pressure vessel failure analysis in viewpoint of human errors and their causal factors.","failure, human error, power generation","reached by Myszewski (2012), which indicated that human errors are ineffectiveness of organizations. This is also supported by Rothblum (2000) who concluded that “most human errors tend to occur as a result of technologies, work environments, and organizational factors which do not sufficiently consider the abilities and limitations of the people who must interact with them, thus “setting up” the human operator for failure”. 3.2. Recommendations Based on the results and discussions presented above, the following recommendations were made: • The failure investigations should focus on both technical causes of failure and human error equally. • Human error should not be viewed as a cause of failure but rather as a weakness of a process, system and organization. • Human error should present a company with an opportunity to improve organizational processes rather only retraining and disciplining or punishing those that commit errors. • Manufacturers should review and improve their design review processes • Checklists should be used to ensure critical steps in design, maintenance and repairs of pressure vessels are adhered to. • There should be awareness training on human errors for manufacturers or designers of pressure equipment. • There should be proper job design and planning to minimize the impact of time pressure • Calculations sheets or software packages should be validated for accurate analysis and results. To try prevent repair / replacement issues from reoccurring or to enable the repair process to properly identify the root cause of failure, the basic process is proposed in Figure 2 below. Figure 2.

112,Potential Role Of Sugar Mills In The Peruvian Development,"this paper gives some preliminary results of systems analysis for ethanol production and utilization options as residue from sugar mills. analyses are carried out for all production-chain, with a particular interest in scenarios in a middle and large time, where ethanol and hydrogen from biomass resources seem very promising. peru has a great opportunity for using renewable sources biofuel in the public transport, energy demand in micro – small enterprises, specially converting traditional crops, like sugarcane, into ethanol to be blended with gasoline or used directly in internal combustion engines. ethanol and sugarcane residues have the potential to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels and the same time to diversifying and to give dynamical to the bioenergy sector. we have identified a market niche in the public transport in lambayeque, a small town at the north of peru, where existing more than 30000 mototaxis (motorcycles adapted for transport of persons and loads) an economic way for public transport based upon gasoline. lambayeque is an agricultural region characterized by sugarcane and rice production and where a new energy scenario could have a positive impact to extend the land base available for agricultural activities and to create new market for small rural farmers. these positive impacts in the dynamics of the rural economy could have a substantial role in reducing the traditional exodus to urban areas and could create more favorable conditions for investment in rural infrastructure, health, and education.","biomass, ethanol, energy","Peruvian producers enjoying preferred access to the United States will be able to export more under a special agreement to meet increasing demand caused by the market expansion and policy energy (Pacheco 2019). Taking advantage of these new opportunities will demand significant improvement in productivity and output. There is growing interest in substituting conventional fuel with much cleaner fuels because ambient concentrations of particulate matter are higher than standard. In this case, the local government needs to adopt policies to encourage the switch to ethanol (Fernandes 2019). Policies might include taxes for fossil fuels and establishing emissions standards for public transport. But will be necessary beginning in house trying to improvement transport and environmental situation. Increasing production and rehabilitant sugar mills will have a great socio-economic impact in all the communities from Lambayeque. A new approach in the development strategies of the region offers the possibility of being able to reduce the environmental impact, improve the enterprises’ economy and the creation of jobs (Gaspar et al. 2020). In the middle term, cost reduction due to increased production and better use of waste, as well as a shift towards fuels less polluting like ethanol, it will open the doors or be the bridge to a solar economy (Figure 2). Figure 2. Figure 2. Integrating sugarcane´s by-product into policy development Sugar mills are ready for ethanol production to be blended in transport sector and selling out the remaining. Then, implementing green harvesting, gasifier and integrating rice husk and other non-biomass renewable resources could be promising a new sustainable energy system.

113,Strategic Integrated Transport For Growth And  Development Strategy In South Africa:,"south african transportation still faces quite a few challenges despite the implementation of brt systems across various metropolitan cities. these include, “lack of public transport accessibility in semi- urban areas, low ridership, equity imbalances and traffic congestion”. observations have revealed that the brt has not been effective in meeting all its objectives. this paper evaluates the strategic integrated transport growth and development in south africa and particularly focuses on the city of johannesburg based rea vaya. a qualitative research design using one-on-one semi-structured interviews was used for data collection. twelve participants were purposefully selected, which included the commuters, drivers, cleaners, fare collectors, security officers, and managers who had been working or using the brt transport system for not less than a year. qualitative content analysis techniques were used for analysing the data and providing an audit trail; the writing of thick descriptions and a reflexive journal were used to attain research quality. the findings suggest that there is a high number of car ownership, overpopulation, large brt lanes, road renovations and traffic light malfunctioning which are all factors responsible for traffic congestion in the city of johannesburg, despite the introduction of the brt system that was developed to foster integrated transport particularly to encourage sustainable growth and development. furthermore, findings revealed that the impact of the brt transport system in the city of johannesburg was positive in terms of saving travelling time, low-prices and creating job opportunities. the negative impact, however, is that the advent of brt has led to the closure of small businesses that are located on the road. poor service delivery, corruption, resistance by taxi drivers, disrespectful passengers, inadequate number of buses, and poor remuneration for the employees and interference by road users, were found to be the challenges of the brt operational system.",brt,"The study seeks to examine the Strategic Integrated Transport for growth and development strategy in South Africa particularly to compare BRT systems in metropolitan areas that have implemented integrated development strategies such as the City of Johannesburg. The investigation disclosed that a high number of car ownership, large BRT lanes, road renovation and traffic light malfunctioning are the major causes of traffic congestion in Gauteng Province. Poor service delivery such as constant system offline, an unprofessional attitude of some employees, reckless driving, overcrowding, late arrival of buses, corruption, resistance by the taxi drivers, disrespectful passengers, inadequate number of buses, interference by road users and poor remuneration for the employees are all factors which contribute to the malfunctioning of this system. To examine the Strategic Integrated Transport for growth and development strategy in South Africa, particularly to compare BRT systems in metropolitan areas that have implemented integrated development strategies such as the City of Johannesburg, I, therefore, recommend that BRT stations, routes and more buses be allocated and allow all stakeholders involved in the decision making process. 4.

System designs would address solar air collectors (SACs) weaknesses through follow up on research done to overcome lower thermal efficiencies and improve SACs performances (Deng et al, 2015). SACs apply in space heating and drying processes due to simple manufacturing and maintenance, freeze resistance and less corrosion compared with solar hot water heating systems (Deng et al, 2015).

120,A Situational Analysis Of Transport Usage In Zambia: A  Modal Perspective Of Railway Freight Services From 1960’S,"zambia’s transportation policy highlights gaps in the transportation sector. this review focuses on analysing railway freight services and provides a departure from other similar reviews through a critical review of the zambia railway sector gaps. the study sought to review existing literature, reports, and online information sources on zambia railway freight services by grouping challenges into thematic groups. causal loop analysis is used to identify cause and effect relationships among challenges specific to zambia. findings indicate that zambia’s railroad infrastructure quality score (2.4) benchmarks below the average mean score (3.5) of all countries in 2017 and further benchmarks below the income group ‘eight-year average’ mean scores on infrastructure quality and train efficiency. zambia has been recording declining railway volumes in terms of ton-km over a 37-years period. five main thematic areas are identified as the main challenges for the railway sector in zambia. these include infrastructure/ equipment gaps, quality gaps, human resource gaps, investment gaps, policy/political will/regional coordination gaps, and business viability gaps. the study recommends the need to improve investments in the railway sector and strengthen government commitment to resolve the majority of challenges currently associated with zambia’s railway sector.","modal perspective, transport usage","and Recommendation The study undertook an analysis on the transport usage in Zambia by specifically reviewing the current railway freight services from 1960 to 2018. The review found that even though Zambia intends to revamp the railway sector through investments in the railway, its current performance is lower than most of the countries in the Sub-Saharan region. The review showed that key policy and strategic documents such as the 7th National Development Plan, National Transport Policy (MTC, 2019), National Transport Policy Implementation Plan, and Statutory instrument No 7 of 2018, all stimulate the growth of the railway freight services in the sector. The review also indicated that Zambia scored lower in the quality, efficiency, performance in relation to goods moved in the industry and other countries in the sub- Saharan region. It can be concluded that Zambia’s railroad infrastructure is old, dating back to the early 1900’s, and this lowers its ability to transport more cargo and achieve higher speed. Additionally, the poor performance can be attributed to a single-track system that poses challenges. A further review of the challenges highlighted in literature and reports indicates that a lack of investment in railway infrastructure in Zambia has led to the poor state of railway infrastructure. The main challenges impacting the railway sector in Zambia include infrastructure/Equipment Gaps; Quality Gaps; Human Resource Gaps; Investment Gaps; Policy/Political Will/Regional Coordination Gaps; and Business Viability Gaps. A causal loop analysis reviewed that a clear linkage between improving investments in railway sector and strengthening government commitment to resolving the majority of the challenges currently associated to the performance of the railway sector as a whole, was significant and high recommended. In order to achieve the movement of Zambia to become a regional hub for transportation services in the SADC, the study recommends that Zambia should address the multiple challenges that have been outlined in the situation analysis of the railway sector.","to 2018 chikusela sikazwe1, 1graduate school of business, university of zambia, lusaka, zambia chisekula@gmail.com, erastus mishengu mwanaumo2 2department of civil and environmental engineering, school of engineering, university of zambia, great east road, lusaka, zambia erastus.mwanaumo@unza.co.zm mwewa mambwe3 3department of construction management and quantity surveying, faculty of engineering and the built environment, university of johannesburg, south africa misswreczz@gmail.com richard kasongo mwale1 1graduate school of business, university of zambia, lusaka, zambia chisekula@gmail.com, engkasongo@gmail.com",
121,An Investigation Of Factors Causing Schedule Overrun In  Telecommunication Projects In Zambia,"the aim of this research was to investigate the causes of time overrun in telecommunication projects in zambia. to achieve this goal a multi-mode descriptive study was adopted by using both qualitative and quantitative approaches. a detailed literature review was undertaken in which 34 factors that cause delay in telecommunication projects were identified and verified through interviews. these factors were then categorised into five generic elements using a fishbone diagram framework. a questionnaire containing 34 identified factors was distributed to the rest of the professionals involved in telecommunication projects including network operators, equipment vendors, contractors, telecommunication infrastructure support companies. the results gave a response rate of 78%. findings showed that eight highest ranked factors were identified with the highest frequency of occurrence and impact on the schedule. most of the interviewed experts pointed to poor planning as the main cause of project schedule overrun, which affects subsequent project phases. based on the fishbone framework, it was also found that process-related factors were the major contributors to project delays. these results highlight the need to adopt the project talent triangle to enhance project time performance for telecommunication projects that improves time management processes and is considered and the emerging trend.","root cause analysis, schedule overrun, time management","and Recommendation Delays are inevitable; however, they can be avoided or minimized when their causes are effectively identified and analysed. This research has identified and, based on the quantified factor importance indices, determined the influence ranks of thirty-four (34) factors causing delays in telecommunication projects in Zambia. The stakeholder perception, through the questionnaire survey, revealed the top eight ranked factors as: (1) Unclear project scope and deliverables at initiation; (2) Poor stakeholder identification and involvement; (3) Under-estimation of activity duration; (4) Over- optimistic estimates; (5) Lack of project surveys or feasibility studies; (6) Lack of dedicated project teams; (7) Procurement approval process; and (8) Late delivery of project materials by suppliers. From the five categories of Management, Process, People, Equipment and Environment, it was concluded that process related factors are responsible for most of the delays experienced in Zambia. From the results, it was identified that either the project managers (PM) do not have the required experience or power to control the activities of the project.

122,Effectiveness In The Contract Management Performance  Within The Lusaka Provincial Administration – A Balanced,"contract implementation is one of the most fundamental but challenging part of procurement contract management. the study focused on assessing how the application of the balanced scorecard can enhance effectiveness in contract management performance at the lusaka provincial administration in zambia. this was done by investigating the factors affecting the practice of contract management and examining the effectiveness of the balanced scorecard. the study adopted both qualitative and quantitative methods. while data was collected using an interview guide and a semi-structured questionnaire. purposive and simple random sampling were used as sampling techniques. the sample size of 76 respondents all took part in the survey giving a 100% response rate, while six (6) technocrats were interviewed. the study findings revealed various challenges affecting the success of contract management. there is also a relationship between balanced scorecard and contract management performance. the study developed a framework that can be used for the implementation of balanced scorecard in bringing about improved contract management performance. the study recommended the need to formulate policy that enhance application of balanced scorecard across the public sector. the study further proposed a model for the implementation of the balance scorecard that can be used to mitigate the challenges.","balanced scorecard, effectiveness, performance","and Recommendation The study objective of assessing how the application of the balanced scorecard can enhance effectiveness in contract management performance at the Lusaka Provincial Administration. Effective contract management improves service delivery in terms of cost, saving time, standardization of processes and procedures as well as facilitates the provision of up-to-dated information on the contract and improved compliance. The study concluded that the application of a balanced scorecard is fundamental in effective enhancing of contract management, and that impacts on positively on both internal and external business processes and organizational growth. The study recommended a model was developed for the implementation of a balance scorecard for contract management performance. The model shows that in implementing the balanced scorecards in an institution, there must be proper development of human resource to ensure the management’s behaviour or people with relevant skills (interpersonal and management skills) to manage these relationships and interconnections of balance scorecard at multiple levels in the organization. It is also recommended that a similar study be replicated in other institutions in the public sector where this tool can be adopted. Further research should also be done involving all the employees at Lusaka Provincial Administration, to evaluate the challenges and successes of implementing a balanced scorecard at Lusaka provincial Administration once adopted. The study limitations include the narrow span of time for conducting the research could not allow to test and validate the proposed model. Additionally, the research was confined to the viewpoints of Lusaka Provincial Administration only and technocrats from ZPPA, RDA, and Ministry of Finance, excluding the viewpoints of other public and private institutions or companies.","scorecard application michael kalumbu nsefu zambia weights and measures agency, lusaka, zambia kalumbunsefu@gmail.com erastus mishengu mwanaumo department of civil and environmental engineering, school of engineering, university of zambia, great east road, lusaka, zambia erastus.mwanaumo@unza.zm mwewa mambwe department of construction management and quantity surveying, faculty of engineering and the built environment, university of johannesburg, south africa misswreczz@gmail.com jacqueline daka university of lusaka, lusaka, zambia jackylute@yahoo.com bupe getrude mwanza graduate school of business, university of zambia, great east road, lusaka, zambia getrude.mutono-mwanza@unza.zm",
123,"Risk Analysis And Management In Public Private  Partnerships Of Urban Markets In Lusaka, Zambia","it has been argued that constructing urban markets through the use of public private partnerships (ppps) allows for quality provision of urban infrastructure at relatively affordable cost in rentals to the public. however, this is not the case in zambia, despite existing policies, ppp act and framework, the country still faces challenges in managing chachacha and luburma public markets in lusaka district. this study aimed at establishing the causes of poor delivery of urban market projects procured using ppp arrangements. the study used an exploratory research design through a mixed method approach in which in-depth interviews and questionnaires were used to collect primary data from 59 respondents. findings disclosed that the causes of poor delivery are centred on project structuring. the study concluded that poor delivery was due to inexperience in ppp structuring which impacted risk assessments and allocation. economic and financial risks were ranked at the very top after political interference, poor contract management, inexperience and poor negotiation as the key reasons why the delivery of public markets have been poor. the study proposed a risk management model and recommended it to be adopted for future urban market project delivery with ppps agreements.","delivery, risk analysis, management","and Recommendation The purpose of the study was to establish the causes of the poor delivery of urban market projects procured using PPP arrangements. The research findings disclosed that the causes of poor delivery are centred on project structuring. political interference, poor contract management, inexperience with PPPs and poor negotiation were revealed as the key reasons why the delivery of public markets has been poor. The research also verified that despite the enactment of a PPP policy and Act in 2009, which was amended in 2018, the regulatory framework in Zambia is still weak. All the findings matched with what is prevailing on the national, regional and global scene which gave the researcher confidence that the findings were reliable. Given the findings of this study, it is recommended that decision makers should adopt as a way ameliorating identified problems discussed in this research through the creation of an enabling regulatory environment that will make risks inherent in PPP projects become much more threatening to project success. Additionally, systematic training and development is required to capacity building of professionals in managing PPP projects during implementation. The adoption of the proposed risk management model is poised to enhance PPP project planning, implementation and monitoring for urban markets, as it suggests processes that could be used to implement PPP projects within the urban market industry. The proposed model was validated through interviews. The study limitations include concessionaires who have been involved in PPP projects that have been poorly delivered did not show willingness to share their experience; and most departments had inadequate experience working with PPPS.","erastus mishengu mwanaumo department of civil and environmental engineering, school of engineering, university of zambia, great east road, lusaka, zambia erastus.mwanaumo@unza.zm michael kalumbu nsefu zambia weights and measures agency, lusaka, zambia kalumbunsefu@gmail.com mwewa mambwe department of construction management and quantity surveying, faculty of engineering and the built environment, university of johannesburg, south africa misswreczz@gmail.com muntanga mfula lindunda muntangalee@gmail.com",
124,Impact Of Stakeholder Engagement On Performance Of  Construction Projects In Lusaka District,"in spite of the many studies on the role of stakeholders’ engagement in road construction projects in zambia, little is known about their impact on performance. one pertinent issue was to address the challenge of ineffective stakeholders’ engagement in road construction projects by way of considering stakeholders’ needs and expectations prior to commencement of project implementation. this study was undertaken with the intention to evaluate the impact of stakeholders’ engagement on performance of road construction projects in lusaka district under the l400 roads project. the study’s aim was achieved through the assessment of relationships between stakeholder engagement and the three performance parameters namely; project cost, project schedule and project specifications. the research approach that was adopted was a quantitative with descriptive research design. both primary and secondary data were collected using a semi structured questionnaire which gave a 98% response rate. findings revealed presence of a strong and positive correlation between stakeholder engagement and project schedule also between stakeholder engagement and project specifications. results also showed that stakeholder’s engagement was strongly but negatively correlated to project cost. a model was recommended for the development and adoption in the management of stakeholders during road construction projects with room for future improvement.","project cost, project model, project schedule","The purpose of the study was to evaluate the impact of stakeholder engagement on performance of roads construction projects in Lusaka District under the L400 roads project. The study concluded that stakeholder engagement was strongly but negatively linear related to project costs in roads construction projects under the L400 roads project in Lusaka District, Zambia. The study also concluded that stakeholder engagement significantly relates to project cost, schedule and specifications. The study found that stakeholder engagement during stages of project scheduling was strongly and positively linear related to project scheduling. Furthermore, it was found that stakeholder engagement during stages of project scheduling was applied to a great extent. The study recommends that stakeholder engagement in road construction projects should be enhanced as this would significantly contribute to performance of projects in-terms of cost. The respondents indicated that stakeholder engagement strongly but negatively relates to project cost such that when one variable increases the other variable decreases. The study also recommends that stakeholder engagement in project costing should not be detached episodes but rather be applied throughout the project cycle. The study further recommends that, stakeholders should be involved throughout the stages of project scheduling in order to ensure that project produces required outcomes as set by concerted efforts. Thus, it is recommended that a model developed for implementing stakeholder engagement in road construction projects be adopted with room for other researches. The study limitations was that some participants especially the Civic Leaders were not very conversant with the Lusaka Four Hundred (L400) Roads project as they claimed to have less knowledge about it.","mwewa mambwe department of construction management and quantity surveying, faculty of engineering and the built environment, university of johannesburg, south africa misswreczz@gmail.com erastus mishengu mwanaumo department of civil and environmental engineering, school of engineering, university of zambia, great east road, lusaka, zambia erastus.mwanaumo@unza.zm michael kalumbu nsefu zambia weights and measures agency, lusaka, zambia kalumbunsefu@gmail.com nicholas sakala university of lusaka, lusaka, zambia nicholassakala24@yahoo.com",

126,A Stochastic Programming Model For Production Planning  And Sequencing Of Multi-Grade Petrochemicals,"in multi-grade petrochemical production, switching of production from one grade to another grade, a certain amount of transitional grade called off-spec is produced. the quantity of the off-spec depends on the sequencing of grades production. the off-spec is a cheap product and to enhance its quality it should be blended with premium grades. therefore, sequencing of multi-grade petrochemical production is vital issue. usually petrochemical production companies try to minimize off-spec production by ordering grades production according to their melt flow rates. following the melt flow rate without taking into consideration customer needs will negatively affect the performance of the petrochemical companies. therefore, a stochastic mixed-integer linear programming model is developed to determine the optimal production plan and the right sequence. the proposed model also take into consideration the impact of demand variations on the integrated production planning and sequencing. the model enforces the production to follow the melt flow rate and satisfy the customer demand, simultaneously. in addition, the obtained results indicate that uncertainty in demand has a high impact on the performance of the proposed model.",,"In this study, a stochastic mixed-integer programming model was developed to effectively integrate and determine the optimal petrochemical multi-grade production planning and sequencing on multi-period and multi- Proceedings of the 2nd African International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management Harare, Zimbabwe, December 7-10, 2020","ahmed m. ghaithan king fahd university of petroleum & minerals, construction engineering and management department, dhahran 31261, saudi arabia ahmedgh@kfupm.edu.sa","References

129,On Suitable Solid Waste Characterization Method For  Nigerian University Campuses,"characterization of waste is the first step in planning any sustainable waste management policy that will stand the test of time. many published works gotten from various publication domains such as science direct, engineering village, springer books, etc. were reviewed to understand different approaches by different authors on the different solid waste characterization methods. the different waste characterization methods have been reviewed in this paper. the methods include two major categories viz; materials flow approach and site-specific/output approach. the materials flow approach utilizes the production data and product weight to estimate the waste quantity and composition on a national basis. the site-specific/output approach involves the sampling, sorting, and measurement of the respective components of a local waste stream. the site-specific approach is further divided into direct sampling at the source and vehicle load sampling of solid wastes. based on some socio-economic and environmental factors like weak environmental laws, indiscriminate waste disposal, inadequate facilities, poor maintenance, poor environmental campaigns, and lack of well-structured waste collection pattern peculiar to nigerian universities, direct sampling or characterization at source promises to be a suitable method for stratifying municipal solid wastes in the country’s campuses.","sorting methods, direct sampling","The different methods of municipal solid waste sampling and characterization were reviewed in this work to recommend an optimal method for waste characterization in Nigerian universities considering the socio-economic and environmental factors peculiar to Nigeria as a state. Due to weak environmental laws that leads indiscriminate waste disposal, inadequate facilities and poor maintenance, poor environmental campaigns, lack of well-structured waste collection pattern, etc., the most appropriate waste characterization method for Nigerian universities is direct method. It reduces the risks and difficulties in sorting some highly degradable waste categories like food and vegetables by providing different waste bags/containers for such wastes. However, it consumes more time, energy and fund. On the other hand, vehicle load sampling/characterization method can be very effectively applied in the university system if there exists a well-structured waste collection system. If collection trucks are made available to major subareas such as academic, residential, administrative, commercial areas, etc. on daily basis, it is more resource conservative. Though this method encourages poor waste disposal habit because most people find it difficult to drop their wastes at waste collection stations for waste trucks. Thereby leading to incomplete collection of wastes for disposal/sampling/characterization. Based on these socio-economic and environmental factors peculiar to Nigerian universities, the proposed optimum method for sampling/characterizing MSW is Direct Sampling/Characterization at Source.","collins o. ugwu department of mechanical engineering, university of nigeria, nsukka onyinyechukwu.ugwu@unn.edu.ng paul a. ozor department of quality and operations management, faculty of engineering and built environment, university of johannesburg, doornfontein campus, 2092, south africa pozor@uj.ac.za department of mechanical engineering, university of nigeria, nsukka, nigeria paul.ozor@unn.edu.ng",

131,Simulating And Optimizing The Stress Distribution On A  Centrifugal Pump Shaft Due To Varying Backpressure,"research studies have shown that several centrifugal pump shafts failure are due to the inability to model the optimal stress on the shaft during operation. most recent studies revealed that the parameters that impacts backpressure have not been properly model for optimal performance during operation. the parameters that impacts backpressure such as stress varying on the shaft are random and therefore the tool of random mechanics can be used to model and simulate the optimal forces during backpressure. in this project the major stresses that impacts backpressure are simulated to determine the optimal stress distribution that a pump shaft can withstand during operation. an auto 360 diffusion desk was used in the modeling and simulation process and the varying stresses on the shaft during backpressure were used to determine the optimal load the shaft can withstand during backpressure. the following results were theoretically derived and validated during modeling and simulation process. it was shown that an increased backpressure during pump operation increases the stress propagation on the shaft spindle and as the backpressure continuous to increased, the key slot stresses increases which leads to an increase in straining that impact shaft performance. the simulated data revealed failure mode after the optimal load on the shaft was exceeded during operation. the obtained simulated results revealed that at extremely high backpressure beyond the optimal stress on the shaft, failure possibility are revealed on the pump shaft and the failure are normally originate slot keyway and propagation of the stress distribution increases during operation","optimization, simulation, failure",,"intensity p. b. sob departmentof mechanical engineering, faculty of engineering and technology, vaal university of technology, vanderbijlpark 1900, private bag x021, south africa peterb@vut.ac.za m. pita department of mechanical engineering, faculty of engineering and technology, university of south africa. unisa pitam@unisa.ac.za",
132,Designing And Simulation A Centrifugal Pump Shaft With  Enhanced Mechanical Properties During Backpressure,"several failures in centrifugal pump shaft are reported due to backpressure leading to unpredicted shaft failure during pump operation. several attempts have been made by engineers in designing and simulating a centrifugal pump shaft that can offer more enhanced mechanical properties which can withstand backpressure during operation. in this paper, a centrifugal pump shaft with more enhanced mechanical properties is designed to withstand backpressure. this is achieved by simulating the relevant parameters of stress-strain which impacts the system during backpressure. in the current study, an auto desk fusion 360 was used to simulate the design shaft relationship of stress and strain parameters on back pressure intensity. during simulation, the centrifugal pump shaft was constrained on a drive end bearing and a non-drive end bearing by using frictionless constrain parameters at extreme back pressure during operation. the following facts were theoretically revealed after simulating the system with an auto desk fusion 360 simulation software. it was observed that, there is extremely low possibility of shaft failure at the keyway slot section and the propagation of failure were invisible in this section of the shaft. when the shaft was subjected to severe stress and strain due to high intensity of backpressure, the material experiences fatigue and the fatigue zone start propagating leading to material defects and failure that were visible observed across the shaft during operation. however, the designed shaft was able to withstand high stress/strain during operation as the new yield stress increases to 207 mpa. the designed simulated shaft was revealed to withstand the subjected backpressure from the system and the possibility of material failure during pump operation was minimize.","design, modelling, stress, strain, centrifugal pump","and Recommendation The aim of the current study was to design a shaft that can withstand backpressure during operation and to achieve that the main factors that impact backpressure which are stress and strain was model and simulated using auto diffusion desk 360 and the following results was revealed. Different colors that revealed different stress intensity and failure modes were used to analyze the design shaft ability to withstand backpressure. It was revealed that the centrifugal pump shaft can withstand a backpressure of 30 MPa during operation without any possibility of failure. From the simulation key variables of failure mode analysis, little or no orange color which revealed a possible high risk to failure during backpressure or red color revealed extreme failure mode due to backpressure was noticed. As the load of stress and strain was increase in the centrifugal pump shaft during operation, little or no failure mode phenomena was reported at 60 MPa and therefore the design shaft was able to withstand a pressure of 100 MPa during operation. Therefore, the designed shaft can withstand backpressure during operation","p.b. sob departmentof mechanical engineering, faculty of engineering and technology, vaal university of technology, vanderbijlpark 1900, private bag x021, south africa peterb@vut.ac.za m. pita department of mechanical engineering, faculty of engineering and technology, university of south africa. pitam@unisa.ac.za",
133,Deriving Value From Waste: Cupola Furnace Slag As A  Solid Lubricant In Drilling Processes,"manufacturing companies have to continuously look for ways to innovate, derive business opportunities and make better use of their waste streams. the value intensification for waste is a grand challenge facing many companies especially the steel making industry. the aim of this research was to investigate and derive new value from furnace slag that is produced by steel companies and currently considered as waste material. the research explored possible uses of cupola furnace slag that is produced as waste in the production of steel in cupola furnaces. after extensive literature review and chemical analysis of the waste material a hypothesis was developed that the use of powdered cupola furnace slag as a solid lubricant in machining processes could help improve machining performance and reduce the use and cost of oil-based cutting fluids. to test the hypothesis drilling experiments were undertaken. the results showed that cupola furnace slag is a possible effective lubricant in the cutting of steel as it both lubricates and inhibits heat diffusion and hence improves machining and manufacturing performance. these findings are important for the steel industry since this presents an opportunity for revenue generation as well as reducing cost of waste disposal and improving environmental credentials. this also opens new opportunities for the academic community to examine the surface industry aspects and to develop sustainability metrics for such waste stream utilisation.","slag, metal cutting, lubricants","and Recommendations 4.1 Conclusions As noted at the beginning the purpose of this research was to identify ways in which two foundry companies in Zimbabwe can utilise the cupola furnace slag that is currently produced as waste. This research showed that cupola furnace slag may be used i. in concrete making as partial replacement of blast furnace slag as aggregate and as partial replacement of Portland cement as well ii. in the production of Na-A and ZSM-5 types Zeolites A further experiment into the research then showed that the 19%Si,13%Al,7%Ca slag may be used as a lubricant in steel cutting. It is effective in drilling and outperformed oil-based cutting fluid when more boreholes are drilled. This can be attributed to its ability to acts as a diffusion inhibitor and elongate the tool life. Looking at Table 4.6, the 19%Si,13%Al,7%Ca slag had Aluminium and Silicon as the elements with the highest content. This makes its properties closer to those of Gehlenite than the 15%Si,8%Al,14%Ca slag properties. This explains the better performance of 19%Si,13%Al,7%Ca slag than 15%Si,8%Al,14%Ca slag as a lubricant in steel cutting. Gehlenite had already showed that it can be used as a lubricant in steel cutting in earlier research. The selection of slag that has a high aluminium and silicon content will help in its use as a cutting tool. It is also noted that both elements are key constituents of coatings for cutting tools. 4.2 Recommendations The use of Cupola furnace slag in Steel cutting is the easiest of the three suggestions that came out of the research. Most importantly it is because it can be used as a powder lubricant directly from their landfills with minimum post processing. The only process that is required is grinding it to a powder form. The research can be taken further by: 1. carrying more drilling tests and testing the application to other materials and cutting processes. 2. grinding the powders to different sizes and evaluate the optimum size of powders for improved machining performance. 3. use of another waste stream material as an alternative to Vaseline. 4. checking the composition of the fumes that are produced while using pastes to find out if they affect the operator. All these will help the environment by utilising cupola furnace slag which is currently just being disposed of as waste in landfills. The companies will benefit by not spending any more on buying soluble oils as lubricants and hence improving their economic and environmental sustainability 5.

135,The Design Of Spray Nozzle For Washing Aggregates In  Mining Industry,"silica (dust) that is created during the crushing of aggregates is presently one of the main causes of silicosis to mining employees and to the surrounding community. the silica created normally attached to the crushed aggregates (road-stone) during manufacturing. this dust must be wash off to prevent the spread of silicosis and other illness during mining process. currently, the major problem faced in washing the crushed aggregates is that the spray nozzle that are currently used by most companies required the aggregates to be washed twice, which in turn costs the company extra money for washing twice. water again is being wasted due to continuous usage. currently there is no adequate study on aggregates washing at low cost under high efficiency. more so, most spray nozzle are so complicated to operate and they are usually very expensive. in the current study we have designed a spray nozzle that is cost effective and very easy to operate under high operating efficiency. the tools of fluid dynamic and design theorem were used to model the nozzle diameter for optimal flow of water distribution during operation. the parameters used in modelling are velocity of the spray nozzle, flow rate of the spray nozzle, and the area that the nozzle will cover. the optimal velocity, flow rate and nozzle diameter were obtained for efficient flow of water during operation. the following facts were theoretically revealed by the model and validated. it was shown that there was an optimal nozzle diameter that gave optimal flow of water. it was shown that there is a certain nozzle diameter size that will offer maximum efficiency during operation. it was also shown that to cover a certain washing area a certain angle of the nozzle must be achieved during operation.","spray nozzle, flow rate, velocity",,"t.j muhanelwa, p.b sob and a.a alugongo department of mechanical engineering, faculty of engineering and technology vaal university of technology, vanderbijlpark 1900, private bag x021, south africa thendojubilant@yahoo.com, peterb@vut.ac.za, alfayoa@vut.ac.za t.b tengen department of industrial engineering and operations management, faculty of engineering and technology vaal university of technology, vanderbijlpark 1900 private bag x021, south africa thomas@vut.ac.za","References

136,Design Of A Real Time Performance Monitoring And  Evaluation System Of Students During Lectures,"at university, there is a mixture of students from different facet of life and background of which the majority is the lower class and rural areas. nowadays in search for better educational quality, students are increasingly travelling across countries, continents and cultures, and ‘international students’ now make up a significant proportion of students in the universities. all these have to fit in and adopt to the university life style which is difficult for some. this is usually indicated by the student’s performance in the lecture others because of language barriers do not participate or even ask questions to the lecturer thus they end up underperforming. currently monitoring and evaluation systems have their roots in results based management approaches (rbma). the development assistance committee dac, (2002:142) defined this approach as “a management strategy focusing on performance and achievement of outputs, outcomes and impacts”. in this light, it is clear that monitoring and evaluation concepts draw on the results-based management approach. in this vein, it should also be recalled that monitoring and evaluation systems are “management toolkits” aiding decision making in any organizations, and enhancing development’s effectiveness through delivery of results. this approach improves organizational performance but to a lesser extend since it is a corrective measure. there is need to evaluate and monitor students in real time during lecture deliverance time. this system monitors the performance of students in real time and sends an evaluation to the lecturer during lecture time. performance of students is realized mainly when aggregating their course work. this system mitigates the institutes from producing poor results by solving the problem before it happens unlike other result based management systems. in this research, the authors designed an automated system which studies the lesson, the student’s responses, taking note of facial expression and notifies the tutor/lecturer how the students response. it sends a message to the person in charge of the lecture on his/ her mobile phone. on a general perceptive, not all students participate in lecture due to self esteem. the majority of the students are just passive and not active in lecture. this system helps in taking note of each student’s response to the lesson being taught in real time as the lesson progresses. it makes use of facial expressions, participation and voice notes when responding to questions or when asking a question. it makes use of a camera which captures students’ image and a trained algorithm to recognize all body languages. matlab, python, java softwares are also used to design this real time performance monitoring system. this system proved to improve the performance of the students by more than 60%.","monitoring, evaluation, real time, zimbabwe",,"gamuchirai mutubuki department of industrial and manufacturing engineering national university of science and technology bulawayo, zimbabwe gamuchirai.mutubuki@nust.ac.zw clayton kamengo department of industrial and manufacturing engineering national university of science and technology bulawayo, zimbabwe claytonkamengo@gmail.com",
137,Opportunities For Energy Savings Based On Behavioural  Patterns Of Residents In Freetown Sierra Leone,"electricity is a major form of energy that is consumed and is also in high demand by the increasing global population of which sierra leone is a part. as a result of the high demand competing for the low generation capacity of the utilities, the ministry of energy of the sierra leone government, charged with the responsibility of generating and supplying electricity, is unable to meet this demand. the rationale of carrying out this research is to see how raising awareness levels on the significance of energy efficiency practices, as a recommendation through an energy audit process, would help bring a solution to how to meet the high electricity demand. a quantitative data analysis method was used in this research. a total 120 structured questionnaires were used in collecting data. from the results analysed, respondents agreed that energy efficiency practices in buildings around freetown, capital of sierra leone, would reduce electricity consumption. furthermore, respondents agreed that an energy audit in buildings around the city of freetown would help in detecting electricity wastages in these buildings. key words energy efficiency, energy demand, energy supply, energy audit, freetown. 1. introduction freetown, the capital of sierra leone is a sub saharan city located in the west coast of africa. according to the housing and population census conducted in 2015, the population of freetown was 1,055,964 (sl census 2015). there is a challenge of electricity access of the inhabitants within freetown and its environs. there are various factors responsible for the low electricity access within the city of freetown, which includes low electricity generating capacity and the inefficient use of electricity by residents in freetown. according to the report on the sustainable energy for all (sefa) mission to sierra leone on the 7th and 8th of june 2012 as documented in the national energy profile of sierra leone (2012), the electricity sub-sector in sierra leone faces challenges with only ten percent (10%) of the citizens in the country having access to electricity. according to kamara (2016), director of energy of the ministry of energy in sierra leone, less than 12.5% of the citizens in sierra leone have access to electricity. however, recently the electricity access has increased to 23.40% (world bank, 2019). proceedings of the 2nd african international conference on industrial engineering and operations management harare, zimbabwe, december 7-10, 2020 © ieom society international 1515",,"The research on the significance of energy saving opportunities based on behavioural patterns of residents in Freetown, capital of Sierra Leone is reported herein.

138,"Potential, Prospects And Challenges Associated With The  Implementation Of Photovoltaic Solar Energy In Zimbabwe","renewable energy is one of the critical solutions to address the ever-increasing demand for energy. in developing countries such as zimbabwe where the conventional generation hardly sustains half of the nation’s energy demands, renewable energy solutions are compensating for the deficit. among these renewables, solar energy technologies have witnessed rapid growth. in most cases, solar energy installers assume to have all the knowledge required in the field. however, many technical barriers still exist within the field of solar energy systems. for solar energy systems which are synchronized to the grid, the integration of these renewables pose a serious stability and protection threat to the already unstable and even stable grids. in this paper, some of the technical problems being faced are discussed. policy issues as well as the possible solutions needed in order to realize full, unhindered growth of solar energy are addressed.","grid integration, renewable energy, stability","and remarks Solar PV projects successfully implemented will be a great benefit to both the national and personal development. With the move towards smart grids, the concepts of demand side management (DSM) can further be incorporated to meet world-class standards. As outlined in this study, Zimbabwe has great potential to meet the standards being set by developed countries in as far as PV systems are concerned. With determination and unit of purpose, the goal is achievable. Grid interlinked PV systems can also be a fundamental way in reducing the burden on the conventional power systems. A centralized monitoring and control center inform of a virtual power plant (VPP) can be set up for these grid interlinked systems. This further helps the participation in the electrical markets platform, thus having a direct effect on the price per kWh of energy. Additional revenue can be saved to improve the national grid network. Current studies show that properly connected PV systems can contribute significantly in network losses reduction, thus more profit to the utility. Well formulated regulations which are already in place and some which can be crafted to benefit the participators may be significant motivator and also leads to more job opportunities as the installations increase.

141,Application Of Machine Learning Techniques To Study  Readmission Of Patients With Cardio Vascular Diseases,"hospital readmissions are indicators of the quality of service offered by hospitals and give an insight into the performance measures on the cost at the hospital. a readmission event occurs when a patient that has been discharged from a hospital after diagnosis and procedure is again readmitted to the hospital within a certain period. the nationwide readmissions database (nrd) is part of a family of databases and software tools developed for the healthcare cost and utilization project (hcup). for this research, the data for the year 2016 from the national readmission database (nrd) will be studied and machine learning models built to model the relationship between readmission and various factors related to the patient. the models built in this research study will be used to ease the prediction of hospital readmission which is very important in healthcare management. ischemic and pulmonary heart diseases are among the critical diseases in health care services. the monitoring of these diseases, therefore, should be handled with ultimate care and with trained professionals. various studies have shown that readmission of these diseases has a higher rate compared to non-pulmonary disease, thus the need for critical research and study in these areas. the observations for ischemic heart diseases and diseases of pulmonary circulation (diagnosis codes i20 to i28) will be used for this study. analysis and goodness of model indexes such as the confusion matrix, auc index, mse, and r squared scores and findings from the study will also be evaluated and reported taking into account the model parameters. biography venkat lellapalli is working on his ph.d in industrial and systems engineering at the mississippi state university in usa . he has twenty years of work experience in healthcare insurance companies working on healthcare and wellness projects using cloud and machine learning technologies to improve quality of care for the members. proceedings of the 2nd african international conference on industrial engineering and operations management harare, zimbabwe, december 7-10, 2020 © ieom society international 1548",,,"venkat lellapalli mississippi state university , usa lvbs@hotmail.com",
142,The Differences In Spatial Memory Between 2D And 3D  Maze Environments,"spatial memory refers to the pathways in the brain that are needed to plan routes to specific locations and remembering where an object is located. this allows humans to use information about their environment to form a model of that environment with instructions on how to navigate it. to do so, the brain integrates sensory information with a map of the environment, to give information about how to traverse it. this experiment investigates whether spatial memory can be transferred between 2d and 3d environments using the rey-osterrieth test and minecraft. it uses one-way anova tests, a two-sample t-test, a product moment correlation coefficient, and linear regression to explore the relationships between different factors on the time taken and errors made in completing the maze. despite having a small sample size, this project shows a statistically significant positive correlation between a participant’s rey- osterrieth score and the number of errors they make on a particular maze. this shows some evidence that spatial memory can be transferred between 2d and 3d environments because of this correlation, but there must be more statistical tests carried out to prove this. these tests include ones that analyze larger datasets, and could shed light on teen hippocampal activity and how spatial memory manifests and is transferred specifically within teen brains.","spatial memory, neuroscience, statistics, minecraft","This experiment explored whether memories of 2D environments transferred to similarly designed 3D environments to find out whether 2D and 3D environments can aid teenagers in navigating 3D spatial memory tasks.. It was conducted because understanding activity in the hippocampus as related to spatial memory transfer between 2D and 3D environments is important in determining whether 2D templates are reliable in aiding navigation of 3D environments. The experiment finds that 2D and 3D tasks prepare teenagers about equally well, but better than not completing any task, for navigating three-dimensional spatial environments. This result supports the original hypothesis by demonstrating a statistically significant difference between the mean times of the group without prior maze experience and the groups with experience. The significant difference between the mean 3D task time of groups that have preparation with a maze and the group that did not, along with how there is not a difference between the mean time of the group with 2D vs. 3D preparation, shows that both 2D and 3D task experience could improve the time taken to complete a 3D task. Regardless of the Rey-O score, both 2D and 3D maze experience could improve completion times in 3D spatial environments. This experiment also correlates performance on the Rey-O test, in 2D, with a reduction of errors in the completion of the 3D maze. Since a 2D test followed by a 3D maze shows an error reduction on that 3D maze, there is evidence that using 2D maps to navigate 3D spaces is neuroscientifically reasonable. There is in fact evidence of a transfer in spatial memory between 2D and 3D maze environments because the Rey-Osterrieth, a two-dimensional test, was correlated with a reduction of errors made in a three-dimensional environment. Although the sample size of this study is not large, the positive correlation makes a case for how there is a transfer in spatial memory between two-dimensional and three-dimensional environments. Therefore, we can infer that a 2D template like the Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure test can provide a logically integrated environment that is similar to a real environment that the brain can use to give the person information about their orientation, heading, and important landmarks. Since the Rey-Osterrieth is a measure of spatial memory, and since participants with higher Rey-O scores traversed a Minecraft task with fewer errors, certain elements in Proceedings of the 2nd African International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management Harare, Zimbabwe, December 7-10, 2020","siddhant karmali stanford online high school, redwood city, ca 94063, usa siddhant.karmali@gmail.com","References

143,Design An Innovative Poker Akqj Game And Study  Players’ Psychological Characters,"poker is a very popular gambling game in casinos, but except professionals, most poker players lose money without applying probability statistics. this paper studies the poker probability by using a partial deck (a total 16 akqj cards with up to 6 players). the authors have used combination formula and derived general formulas of matching probability for each matching pattern. to simplify probability simulation, partial deck poker game was designed which can increase the matching probability significantly on some higher ranked patterns such as “full house”. with this creative akqj game, the winning patterns are down to “four of a kind”, “full house”, “three of a kind”, and “two pairs”. if all 6 players are playing, this poker akqj game can be very competitive since the basic poker probability would be calculated to guide each poker player on their betting to avoid any risky move. to study the player’s personality and psychology, each player has been assigned different playing characters based on the assigned degree of risk taking. through this poker akqj data simulation based on the worst-case probability, the poker players may avoid gambling disorder and lose a lot of money.","modeling, statistics, jmp, poker",This innovative AKQJ Poker Game has significantly simplified the winning probability calculation. The worst- case algorithm has made it feasible that the Poker players could calculate their overall winning probability and make a rational betting decision based on their pre-set risk-taking character. The simplified AKQJ game has significantly minimized the players’ emotional character and limit players’ tricks to confuse the winning probability. The winner of each run becomes more random and less dependent on players’ psychological characters while calculating the winning probability quickly in real poker game becomes more critical.

145,Improving The Efficiency And Stability Of Centrifugal Pump  Filtration System Using Membrane System,"centrifugal pump performance is reported to be low when the pump is exposed to contaminated fluids during operation. the contaminated fluids are reported to have caused pump scaling and fouling. most centrifugal pumps are reported to have been damaged due to pump scaling and fouling. the suction strainers are usually used to prevent scaling and fouling by preventing unwanted impurities from getting into the centrifugal pump system during operation. the current suction strainers used in a centrifugal pump system have pore sizes that are poorly characterised leading to the current problem of poor separability during pump operation. membrane technologies used in separation technology are reported to have better separability if the membrane pore sizes are properly characterised for optimal separability. in the current study, a new approach is used to design suction strainers using membrane technology for efficient and stable performance of the centrifugal pump. the tools of computational fluid dynamic and stochastic mechanics are used to model the fluid flow characteristics, and to characterize the membrane pore size distribution without the flow of impurity in the pump system for efficient, and stable performance. the following facts are theoretically derived and validated after theoretical modeling and simulation of the relevant parameters. the first signal of fouling of a membrane is a reduced volumetric flux, and this is caused by resistance which is due to concentration polarisation and reduced mass transfer coefficient. it was also shown that the design membrane has its own resistance which, when kept to a minimum will have a high initial volumetric flux. a better performing membrane will have a low resistance which subsequently will increase the initial volumetric flux, consequently increasing the rate at which fouling occurs. it was also shown that the trans-membrane pressure is directly proportional to volumetric flux; however there is a deviation when impurities are deposited onto the membrane surface and into the membrane pores.","centrifugal pump, fouling, zimbabwe, december 7-10","A number of conclusions were drawn based on the results found in this project. From the results of the membrane resistance, it can be concluded that a membrane has its own resistance based on its material. This resistance is responsible for reducing volumetric flux during operation. However, as also shown, the membrane resistance depends on the thickness of the membrane. Therefore, to reduce the resistance, the membrane has to be very thin. With respect to time, the thin and thick membrane were compared for 5 minutes and results showed how the flow rate had dropped in each one. For a thin membrane, the flow rate was still higher than the thick membrane and this is due to the amount of resistance that is present when a membrane is thick. That is why a thick membrane is quick to have cake layer formation. From the concentration results, it can be concluded that the concentration of the fluid before and after the membrane should not be the same. When a membrane is effective, the concentration of the fluid after the filtration should be lower. And, as concluded from the results, this is better achievable with a membrane of lower resistance.","t.s lekalakala, p.b sob and a.a alugongo department of mechanical engineering, faculty of engineering and technology vaal university of technology, vanderbijlpark 1900, private bag x021, south africa lekalakalasylvester@gmail.com, peterb@vut.ac.za, alfayoa@vut.ac.za t.b tengen department of industrial engineering and operations management, faculty of engineering and technology vaal university of technology, vanderbijlpark 1900 private bag x021, south africa thomas@vut.ac.za",
146,Impact Of Accounting Methods On Supply Chain  Contracts: Analysis Based On E-Tailer Supply Chain Costs,"cost optimization is a widely discussed topic in the supply chain literature, where effective supply chain contracts are identified as essential tools that can address the strategic issues such as ineffective costs, integration, information sharing and coordination. knowing how supply chain costs are measured is vital for all supply chain members, where different accounting methods used to derive cost information. therefore, accenting methods have implications on supply chain cost information, thereby affecting supply chain contracts formed among various supply chain partners. however, the studies that explored the relationship of cost measurement based on accounting methods with supply chain contracts are scant in literature. therefore, we propose propositions considering historical cost accounting, fair value accounting and creative accounting in a contractual framework of an e-tailer supply chain, operating in an asymmetric informational scenario. the findings indicate that both historical and fair value-cost accounting methods affect supply chain contract outcomes when market conditions change. furthermore, creative accounting directly impacts supply chain contracts if incentive-compatible constraints are not defined as it creates room for manipulating cost information.","accounting methods, cost optimization, cost measurement","This paper analyzes the impact of cost measurement on the outcomes of the supply chain contracts. Cost measurement in supply chain organizations depends on the accounting methods adopted. Literature related to accounting information and contracts discusses the importance of accounting information and its impact on contractual outcomes. However, no clear evidence is found related to accounting information and its effect on the supply chain contracts and supply chain costs, even though cost minimization is one of the critical objectives of any supply chain operation. Therefore, this study addresses this gap and attempt to derive the relationship between the accounting information derived through different accounting methods and the supply chain costs and contracts. The study uses an e-tailer supply chain with three-player scenarios, led by an e-tailer since e- commerce supply chains are highly dependent on accurate information.

Energy can be reclaimed in liquid form as oil, solid form as char, or as a gas. Plastic waste is bulky, occupying a larger volume; pyrolysis reduces the bulk of the trash. All products obtained from pyrolysis can be put to good use, making pyrolysis an efficient method/tool for waste management.

149,Bioenergy Efficiency Evaluation For   Sustainable Optimization In Sub-Saharan Africa,"energy underpins economic growth globally regardless of the levels of development achieved this far. it is key to the production of food and water supply and other goods and services in sub-saharan africa (ssa) and globally. however, energy production and utilization and the interdependent economic activities, agriculture, forestry and other land use, results in high greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions. using qualitative analysis, we evaluated the different primary energy sources within the energy supply chain network from generation, through its conversion to utilization to determine the energy efficiency and quantify the opportunity to mitigate these losses. we found that about 90% of the primary energy is lost through unsustainable conversion processes and only about 10% of the energy is utilized. specifically, there is an opportunity for energy efficiency strategies to improve bioenergy capacity in ssa by about 40% on both the supply and demand side to reduce energy poverty and drive economic growth while transitioning to a low-carbon economy and climate-resilient energy sector, thereby enhancing sustainability and delivering universal and affordable energy access to all in ssa.","sub-saharan africa, bioenergy, efficiency","Although Africa only contributes about 2% of the world’s energy-related CO2 emissions to date, it suffers disproportionately from the climate change effects alongside food insecurity, health risks and economic insecurity. Further, 80% of the consumed energy in SSA is solid biomass (wood) and in its transformed form (charcoal), of which only 12.4% and 6% are available useful energy for cooking. This gives energy efficiency strategies an opportunity to optimize the bioenergy resource in SSA on both the supply-side (Generator) and demand-side (Conversion Appliances). Optimal sustainable bioenergy use of energy at all stages of the supply/demand chain could reduce the negative impacts of energy consumption, while still allowing the same economic development, thereby enhancing sustainability and delivering clean and affordable energy access to all in SSA.

150,"Towards Decentralised Water Access, A Primer Solar  Pumped Water Design Solution To Aid The Covid-19 Fight.","hand hygiene has been shown to prevent respiratory illness covid-19 and is recommended after coughing and sneezing and/or on entering the home having come from outside. functioning handwashing facilities with water and soap are recommended to be available within 5m of all toilets, both public and private. this paper proposes a design of a piped water scheme for an identified rural centre to increase sustained access to safe water as a primer solution to the fight against covid-19. for the identified borehole, the safe pumping yield is taken as 80 % of capacity test and is given as 1.2m3/h. a special user defined excel simulation program was developed and employed that specified a 1.7kw motor pump, powered by a 1000 wp solar array delivering a peak flow rate of 1.2m3/hr (12m3 of daily water yield) for the least insolation day at a tdh of 63m with overall pumping efficiency of 11l/wp. the hazen-williams method was used to specify a 32mm class 6 hdpe pipe that stretches for 530m as the pumping main. the mass balance curve gave a minimum balancing water storage of 30m3 on considering the risk of water quality deterioration given the absence of a disinfection regime.","capacity test, covid-19, configurations, disinfection, efficiency","and Recommendations WASH is a prerequisite for quality care, and is particularly important for the safe management of COVID-19. The provision of safe water conditions is essential for preventing and for protecting human health during all infectious disease outbreaks, including of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Ensuring evidenced-based and consistently applied WASH practices in communities, homes, schools and healthcare facilities will help prevent human-to- human transmission of pathogens including SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. The designed system is capable of supplying a daily water yield of 12m3. Ensuring universal access to WASH services in health care facilities is a solvable problem with a return on investment per day which is adequate to provide basic WASH services. The design was limited to sizing only the Solar Pumping systems and the related mains pipeline and storage. Further research can be developed to determine the distribution network distribution piping total length, spacing of the demand centres and the number of standpipes allocated for each demand centre. Key recommendations for Rural water supply (RWS) that can be adopted as priority actions in the fight against COVID- 19 include developing a national program to repair and rehabilitate wells and boreholes. Placing responsibility and asset ownership of RWS with rural district councils, and build their sector capacity, whilst encouraging support from communities and the private sector and rethinking maintenance/spares policy and develop a regulated, competitive drilling industry.

151,"Analysis Of Elastic-Plastic Buckling Of A Thin Rectangular  Plate, Considering Nonlinear Strain Terms","the present study is concerned with the elastic/plastic buckling of a thin rectangular plate when nonlinear strain terms are put into consideration in the equation of uniqueness. buckling analyses of the plate was placed under different loading conditions i.e. uniaxial compression, biaxial compression and pure shear loading. the equilibrium and stability equations are derived and analysed based on the elastic theory presented by hooke’s law and two theories of plasticity i.e. deformation theory (dt) and incremental theory (it). rayleigh-ritz method was used as a discretization technique to solve the buckling of plate equation. a comparison of results between nonlinear strains versus linear strains was carried out and a 6.7% difference was observed when the plate was subjected to pure shear loading. the variation between the two cases was seen to increase as boundary equations became complicated when pure shear stress was considered. furthermore, different parameters have been discussed i.e., effects of aspect ratio, thickness to width ratio and loading ratios, effect of different boundary condition and the type of plasticity theory considered.",incremental theory,"on Uniaxial and biaxial loading The constitutive equations were obtained based on incremental theory (IT) and deformation theory (DT) formulations and procedures were worked out in detail using the energy method and Rayleigh-Ritz method. The results for code1 were compared with previously published data to verify the established methodology and procedures, it was observed that the results obtained by the deformation theory were much closer to the practical results obtained by Anderson[44]. The effects of aspect, thickness to length and loading ratios, boundary conditions, deformation and incremental theories and uniaxial and biaxial loading on the buckling coefficient were studied in detail. Based on the numerical results, the following conclusions are reached:  The aspect ratio has considerable effect on the buckling coefficient in IT and DT and it was observed that the buckling capacity had the most significant variation over a certain range of aspect ratios and as the aspect ratio increased the results became constant. A plate under the same boundary condition was analyzed and was concluded that the buckling mode shape is also determined by the type of plastic theory used.  Plastic buckling coefficients depend on boundary conditions, thickness to length and aspect ratios, loading parameter and type of theory of plasticity.  The variations of plastic buckling mode shape are less in biaxial compression rather than in uniaxial loadings. Moreover, the buckling mode shapes are more affected by loading parameter.  The discrepancy between IT and DT increases by applying more clamped boundary conditions, increasing thickness to length ratio.  The buckling coefficient increases as the loading parameter changes from uniaxial compressive (𝛽𝛽̅ = 0) to biaxial compressive loading (𝛽𝛽̅ = 1)  With increasing the loading ratio in biaxial compression, the differences between theories increase. For a plate under these loading condition it can be concluded that the nonlinear strain terms do not have a significant effect on the results obtained when the incremental theory or deformation theory were used. This confirms the Kirchoff’s plate theory in which these terms are neglected. 5.1 Conclusion based on pure shear loading With the aim of determining the effects of including the non-linear strain terms into the equation of uniqueness the effect of shear deformation is taken into account in the analysis by adopting the Von karman plate theory. The results are extensively compared with the case when the non-linear strains were neglected and it has been observed that as in the case of elastic buckling, the effect of shear deformation lowers the plastic buckling stress parameter and the effect is more pronounced for the results obtained by IT when compared with their DT counterparts. The effect of aspect ratios and thickness-to-width ratios on the plastic buckling stress parameters were investigated. It has been observed that the influence of including nonlinear strain terms cannot be neglect when a plate is under pure shear loading. This was due to the 6.7% difference between the results of nonlinear and linear. It was also observed that the percentage difference between nonlinear and linear results is more pronounce as the boundary condition becomes more complicated. It was found that the buckling mode switches at particular aspect ratios for CCCC plates. Moreover, the cusps locations also depend on the type of plasticity theory used. This indicates that the plastic buckling mode shape may be different from its linear strain terms counterpart for a given aspect ratio. However, as the aspect ratio becomes large, the effect of the a/b value on the ultimate shear capacity of plates fades out For small thickness-to-width ratios, the plastic buckling solutions are close to their linear counterparts while, for large thickness ratios, the plastic buckling solutions are substantially lower than their linear counterparts. Generally, the plastic buckling stress parameters obtained by IT are larger than their DT counterparts. The difference increases with increasing thickness-to-width ratios. Apparently including the nonlinear strain terms has no effect on the change of IT accuracy, still the buckling loads predicted by the deformation theory, despite its physical shortcomings, are found to be in better agreement with experiments, whereas those based on the incremental theory are found to be significantly higher than the experimental ones. However, as far as pure shear loading is concerned, we cannot quickly neglect the nonlinear strain Proceedings of the 2nd African International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management Harare, Zimbabwe, December 7-10, 2020","roy n mushonga faculty of engineering, isfahan university of technology, iran faculty of engineering, university of zimbabwe, harare, zimbabwe luxmadiye@gmail.com mehdi salmani-tehrani faculty of engineering, isfahan university of technology, iran luxmore madiye faculty of engineering, university of zimbabwe, harare, zimbabwe luxmadiye@gmail.com loice gudukeya faculty of engineering, university of zimbabwe, harare, zimbabwe faculty of engineering and the built environment, university of johannesburg, johannesburg, south africa loicekmg@gmail.com","REFERENCES

152,Green Manufacturing For Waste Reduction In The Food  Industry,"going green is an inevitable manufacturing practice in the midst of growing concerns over the need to reduce environmental waste. compared with the pre-industrialization era, the carbon footprint has increased from 228 ppm to 413.3 ppm, landfills have increased and so has the leaching of toxins into nearby water bodies. the food industry is one of the largest contributors to the current state of the environment and hence, the reality of the need for waste reduction within the industry cannot be overemphasized. this paper assesses the dairy, soft drink and bakery industries, and brings the following to the attention to the manufacturer: waste production, energy losses, pollution and its impact to the environment during each stage of the product lifecycle. particular attention is paid to the current production processes, and these are critically analyzed, considering the raw materials, the processing, and the final products. finally, the paper proposes solutions on the manufacturing process and on how the wastes can be avoided, reduced, reused, recycled, recovered, treated and disposed responsibly.","green manufacturing, food industry, waste",,"gamuchirai mutubuki department of industrial and manufacturing engineering national university of science and technology bulawayo, zimbabwe gnmtubuki@gmail.com gibson p chirinda department of industrial and manufacturing engineering national university of science and technology bulawayo, zimbabwe gibbschirinda@gmail.com",
153,Design Of A System That Can Harvest Essential Oils From Plants  For Pharmaceutical Uses,"there are several methods available used to extract essential oils. there are conventional and non-conventional methods with the latter being more efficient than the former. currently at the pharmacy department of the university of zimbabwe there is no functional extraction machine. the ones that were used have worn out and thus have since been decommissioned. with this in mind, the present project sets out to solve this problem by coming up with a new system design that uses the subcritical water extraction method to extract essential oils faster and more efficiently as compared to the previously available steam distillation machine. the machine has a pressure tank which acts as the extraction vessel and the subcritical water is passed through the plant material inside the vessel. the temperature of the water inside is maintained at a specific temperature. the tank is pressurized using a pump and valves to maintain the pressure inside the extraction vessel. the products of the extraction process cooled and separated. the extraction tank and the pipes are analyzed using autodesk inventor to determine the safety of the design.","subcritical, water, extraction, essential","Although the design has been shown to be safe, it has done so by a small margin. In light of this some improvements may be done to the design to improve its strength and reliability and these are; ● The design safety factor has to be increased in order to stronger components ● The heating method may need some improvements. The oven can be replaced by a more efficient heating element which heats the vessel directly. ● The design needs to be automated. The present design has the potential of delivering a more efficient, faster and a greener method of essential oils extraction which will produce high quality products that satisfy the world’s standard.","kudakwashe kusena and tawanda mushiri industrial and mechatronics engineering department, faculty of engineering and the built environment, university of zimbabwe 630 churchill avenue, harare, zimbabwe kudakwashekusena@gmail.com, tawanda.mushiri@gmail.com lameck s. chagonda pharmacy department, faculty of medicine and health sciences, university of zimbabwe 630 churchill avenue, harare, zimbabwe chagonda@medic.uz.ac.zw, lschagonda@gmail.com",

155,Potential Pre-Treatment And Processing Routes For Recovery Of  Gold From Complex (Refractory) Gold Ores. A Review,the depletion of high grade and easily extractable gold ores has inspired development of innovative approaches for sustainable beneficiation of complex (refractory) gold ores. a complex gold ore is generally defined as an ore that is difficult to treat by using the conventional metallurgical unit operations. this difficulty is mainly due to their complex mineralogy that is associated with a low degree of liberation. mineralogical characterisation strongly assists in defining the amenability of the complex ore to conventional treatment processes. this paper reviews the currently available pre- treatment and processing routes in order to determine future research in the treatment and processing of complex gold ores. the overall goal is to inspire knowledge improvement for the development of a commercially effective technique.,"complex gold ore, processing, 2016). however","The pre-treatment and processing of complex/ refractory gold ore is becoming more and more pronounced and is an inevitable trend to gold development due to the rapid depletion of high grade ores. Significant progress has been recorded in recent years as scientists continue to explore ways of pre-treating and processing refractory gold ores sustainably. A process for gold recovery will only be deemed successful if the cost of implementing the process is much less than the value of the precious metal itself. In addition, environmental issues should be valued in the selection of a process. A review of the potential pre-treatment and processing technologies has shown that the main problems that need urgent attention in the gold industry are the need to improve on recovery, cost and environmental issues. A highly cost efﬁcient and environment friendly technology to improve gold recovery from complex ores is therefore needed in future. In summary, as the proportion of low grade ores is becoming larger and larger, it is imperative to develop technologies for lower cost and higher gold recovery rates to ensure sustainability in the gold industry.

156,Predicting Congenital Heart Diseases Using Machine  Learning,"the researcher was working on the idea that machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence has proved more accurate than humans in predicting heart diseases. congenital heart diseases (chds) are responsible for a greater percentage of infant mortality worldwide, hence the need to detect and predict the diseases at birth for the administration of proper and on time treatment. the target of the project was to come up with an algorithm that can be linked to a device(s) for inputs or that can receive inputs entered manually and give a prediction of potential chds. this has been previously addressed as the prediction of heart disease in general but there has not been enough focus on congenital heart diseases hence for this study. the researcher made use of the k-nearest neighbours (k-nn), logistic regression and support vector machine (svm) to develop three prediction algorithms in python programming. the prediction accuracies of the three in algorithms were compared and the one with the highest score was selected. according to the selected svm algorithm the researcher saw 73% accuracy in prediction. one recommendation is that more specific data on chd should be collected to create better datasets.","prediction, linear regression","The main purpose of this project was to develop a system that will allow for the prediction of congenital heart diseases at birth and some weeks after birth that uses machine learning to improve the accuracy of prediction. Three algorithms (K-Nearest Neighbours, Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine) were tested with the dataset to select the one with the highest accuracy. The support vector machine algorithm was taken up and the disease prediction system was developed. The proposed system achieved an accuracy of 73% which met our objective target of 70%. In the proposed system the database is password protected making information stored secure and the front- end interface developed in PHP and HTML is simple and easy to use. 12. Recommendations There are several limitations that were encountered in this study that when addressed in future studies would make for more efficient, reliable, and convenient congenital heart disease prediction systems. Firstly, more data directly focussing on congenital heart disease should be collected to build specific datasets that will be used to train the machine learning algorithms. Also, in future studies, before coming to a concrete conclusion more machine learning algorithms should be tested with the dataset to pave way for more accurate CHD predictions. As the data volumes grow computers with greater processing power will also be required to perform the predictions. In the light of the full implementation of Health 4.0 to keep up with the times, portable heart disease input device(s) that can continually monitor the parameters sending the collected results to the cloud server remotely should be developed. 13.

157,A Modified Firefly Algorithm For Global  Optimization Of Collaborative Supply,"the optimality of supply chain networks (scn), associated with inventory management, is one of the mandatory objectives for industries. the main purpose of this research is to minimize the total expected costs of collaborative supply chain networks. this research investigates the applicability of the modified firefly algorithm for minimizing the total cost of collaborative supply chain networks based on large-sized problems, in which the vendor uses vmi policy for collaborations and direct-delivery policy for non-collaborations. it is assumed that industrial plants with assigned warehouses are willing to share their existing capacities with other industrial plants with no assigned warehouses to reduce the undesirable costs associated with shortage and extra inventory. since this problem is one of the larger problems related to industrial supply chain networks, commercial software cannot obtain the optimal results for these problems considered in this research. to achieve better findings, we applied a modified firefly algorithm to solve the problem. the computational time of the proposed algorithm was also reduced as compared with commercial software and standard firefly algorithm.","firefly algorithm, stochastic demand",,"chain networks under stochastic demand abdulhadi altherwi department of industrial engineering jazan university jazan, saudi arabia department of industrial & systems engineering oakland university rochester, mi 48309, usa aaltherwi@oakland.edu daw alwerfalli a leon linton department of mechanical engineering lawrence technological university southfield, mi 48075, usa dalwerfal@ltu.edu",
158,Using Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation To Detect  Aluminium And Mercury Preservatives Accumulated In The,"since the 1980s, the center for disease control and prevention has changed their recommended childhood vaccination schedule from 22 doses of seven vaccines by the age of six to 50 doses of 14 vaccines by the age of six. in a similar timeframe, the prevalence of autism spectrum disorders (asd) has increased. it is possible that these two are related. this paper intends to hypothesize that transcranial magnetic stimulation (tms) could be utilized to detect levels of mercury and aluminium in the brain, due to the magnetic properties. tms works by sending magnetic field pulses into both the peripheral and central nervous system. if we can connect the magnetic field pulses to the magnetic properties of mercury and aluminium, we can potentially track how the mercury has affected the brain and determine if this may have caused asd.","vaccination, diagnosis","In less than half a century, the number of recommended vaccines for children younger than six has more than tripled. In the same span of time, the occurrence of ASD has also increased drastically from the early 1990s being about 1 in 2500 to the 2018 reports from CDC’s ADDM statistics claiming approximately 1 in 59 children in the USA are likely to be diagnosed with ASD [13]. Many researchers and scientists have hypothesized that the two are related. This paper draws a connection between this standing hypothesis and Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation. TMS can be utilized to gather more information about ASD as well as to help manage many of its symptoms.

159,The Assessment And Characterization Of Critical Thinking  Skills Of Upper Division Technology Students Using The,"critical thinking skills are essential for 21st century citizens to possess (halpern, 1997). educators and employers are assessing these skills many different ways ranging from multiple-choice tests to subjective observational protocols. this research focused on the assessment of undergraduate students nearing degree completion in a technology program. the assessment instrument used was the critical thinking assessment test (cat), developed by tennessee technological university under the sponsorship of the national science foundation (stein & haynes, 2011). it is an assessment tool that is designed to measure important components of critical thinking. this test also provides feedback that can assist the faculty in determining some measure of the effectiveness of coursework, curricula, and departmental learning activities. characteristics of critical thinking include the abilities to evaluate information, to think creatively, to learn, and to solve problems. these skills are desired by employers and are a valued capability of technology graduates (davies, 2013; scott, 2008). because they are necessary for the future success of undergraduate technology students, it is valuable to have a direct measure of critical thinking skills. by using an empirical assessment of these skills, faculty can assess what critical thinking skills are present or are lacking in undergraduate students and make curricular improvements to better develop these skills. over a three-year period, the cat exam was administered to six groups of undergraduate students at a large midwestern research university during their final year of study. a total of 209 students from all four different degree program options offered at this institution (agricultural & biosystems management (abm), machine systems (ms), manufacturing (mfr), and occupational safety (os)) participated in this study. the reported test score national mean was 19.04. the test score mean of this sample of upper division technology students from all options was 18.62. these undergraduate technology students performed with no statistically significant difference from the cat exam population, t(208) = 1.22, p = .22. when considering cat exam performance by degree option, the anova indicated difference existed, f(3,205) = 3.27, p = .022. the application of the tukey hsd test revealed that the only significant difference between the means, p < .01, existed between the agricultural & biosystems management (m = 19.85, sd = 5.19) and occupational safety (m = 15.50, sd = 4.42) students. this current research confirms that the cat exam is useful for assessing the critical thinking skills of undergraduate technology students. a difference in exam scores of the abm students and os students warrants further investigation. future research with this same undergraduate student sample includes analysis of individual cat scores, act scores, and high school grade point averages to determine their relationship. also, the cat score relationship to grades in prerequisite degree coursework and grades in technology specific courses will be examined. future research can better assist faculty members in identifying particular course and curriculum opportunities to further develop critical thinking skills in undergraduate technology students.","critical thinking, zimbabwe, december 7-10",,"critical thinking assessment test (cat) matthew harvey department of agricultural and biosystems engineering iowa state university ames, ia 50011, usa meharvey@iastate.edu",
160,Broadcasting Beyond: Making The Next Generation In  Communication,"broadcasting requires a large setup in order to function well. it is very important for the reader to look directly into the camera while reading the teleprompter. looking at the camera is vital so that the viewer sees the reader looking directly at them. current equipment is large, bulky, expensive, and hard to move around. with everything getting smaller yet more powerful, why have broadcasting systems remained so big and tedious? the first step to solving this problem is to look at the camera. cameras in portable devices today are powerful enough to match larger cameras. a much smaller camera taken from a smartphone could be powerful enough to get a clear recording of someone reading from a teleprompter. modern smartphone cameras can record video in 4k with 60 frames per second. that amount of quality should be enough to broadcast at a high standard. the next biggest problem would be the monitor. current teleprompters have a screen placed horizontally with a slanted mirror on top to reflect what’s on the monitor. this is not space efficient. in order to solve this problem, the camera could be placed behind the monitor. no mirrors would be involved, and the monitor would be upright. there are some ideas as to how to get the camera to see through the screen. the first idea was to put a small hole through the liquid crystal display of the monitor, so that the small phone camera can see through. this caused problems because any hole through the display would cause the liquid crystals to leak and cause bleeding on the monitor. another proposed idea was to use a transparent display. that idea could work with 100 percent transparency, but that rarely is the case. the slight dim on the screen would be visible to the camera, and the quality of the video would suffer. the third idea was to split the screen into four displays, with the camera in the center of them. the issue with this was cost efficiency, since it requires 4 separate monitors. another important part of this project is setting up the perfect system. the system that is required is one with a motherboard that is powerful enough to record and stream the video as well as have enough inputs and outputs to work with all the equipment. a unique feature of the system is to include a sim card reader, so that there can be cellular data connection. the idea is to bond the wired connection of the system and the cellular data connection together in order to stream the video without sacrificing quality. in order to follow the mission to make a smaller system, the hardware will utilize a motherboard that is much smaller than a regular desktop motherboard. many of the potential boards were dedicated for mobile devices or embedded systems, and thus, are a good size for this project.","broadcasting, eye-contact, remote, teleprompter",,"aaron lindlbauer department of electrical, computer engineering and embedded software engineering lawrence technological university southfield, mi 48075, usa alindlbau@ltu.edu george pappas, ph.d. & david newman department of electrical, computer engineering and embedded software engineering lawrence technological university southfield, mi 48075, usa gpappas@ltu.edu, david.newman@kdnvideo.com",
161,"The Relationship Between Risk Management And Safety,  Health, Environment And Quality Policy Implementation","the study aimed at ascertaining whether national council for construction (ncc) registered contractors classified in grade one employ safety, health, environment and quality (sheq) to mitigate risks at projects. the study also sought to establish the sheq policies employed in the construction industry and the risks incurred due to non-conformance with policies. an exploratory sequential mixed method was adopted in which a structured interview guide and a questionnaire was used as data collection tools from a sample of 54 respondents out of which 38 (72%) responded. data was analysed using statistical package for social sciences (spss) version 26.0. findings reviewed that leadership, individual behaviour, management commitment, and communication are correlated to the implementation of sheq policy. risk management variables established are safety and health performance, managed construction costs, and quality and environmental performance. risks encountered by contractors for not implementing sheq were political, economic, social, technical, environmental, legal, and management risks. it was established that failure to employ sheq policies had a high impact on the management of risks on site, hence, a strong correlation between sheq policy implementation and risk management. the study recommends the use of the developed risk management framework that incorporates sheq to mitigate risks.","implementation, risk management","and Recommendations The study sought to establish the impact that employed SHEQ policies had on the management of risk and proposed the best risk management framework with the incorporation of SHEQ. The study found that the SHEQ policy, management commitment, leadership and accountability, communication, involvement of employees in SHEQ processes activities, supplier/contractor/customer engagement, zero harm, environmental sustainability and quality products or services, training roles and responsibilities and performance monitoring, review and responsibilities, are variables that can be adopted in construction by contractors when implementing SHEQ management systems.

162,A Regression Model Upon Treatment Of Amd Using  Pervious Concrete,"regression modelling is used to establish the qualities of pervious concrete that treats amd. in order to investigate the relationship between dependent and independent variables, regression modelling technique was used. this technique is used to analyze several variables. regression analysis helps to understand the effect of each independent variable on the dependent variable. in this research regression modelling is done to establish the properties of pervious concrete that treats amd and to understand the relationship between the amd treatment variables. familiar methods of regression analysis such as linear regression is used in this research. the amd quality is modelled as the dependent variable and all other variables are independent variables. it was found that the thickness and the aggregate size of the pervious concrete slab does effect the metal concentration and ph of amd as it passes through the pervious concrete.","regression model, mining, parameter","The linear regression model in Figure 2 establishes the properties of pervious concrete that threat AMD. These results can be used when designing the concrete wall which is the subject of another paper. This regression model clearly shows that there is a core relationship between the aggregate size and the thickness of the pervious concrete slab [4-6, 9]. Equation 2 can be used to design a concrete block that can treat AMD depending on the pH value that is required. The thickness of the pervious concrete decreases as the aggregate size increases and vice-versa. For example if the value of aggregate size is 6.7mm using equation 2 the thickness of the concrete wall will be y = -3,8462(6.7)+ 145,77 = 120mm , the volume of the concrete doesn’t make the difference on the PH value and the metal filtration, as long the thickness and aggregate size are correct. Equation 2 can be used to determine other paramerterts such as the size of the aggregate and the thickness of pervious concrete barrier. y = 0.5571x + 8 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 AMD PH AGGREGATE SIZE AMD PH VS AGGREGATE SIZE y = 0.0035x + 6.8357 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 50 100 150 200 250 AMD PH PERVIOUS CONCRETE THICKNESS AMD PH VS CONCRETE THICKNESS Proceedings of the 2nd African International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management Harare, Zimbabwe, December 7-10, 2020","l. mafanya department of mechanical and industrial engineering technology university of johannesburg johannesburg, south africa leedzmafanya@gmail.com d.v.v. kallon department of mechanical and industrial engineering technology university of johannesburg johannesburg, south africa dkallon@uj.ac.za","References

171,A Review Mitigation Efforts And Natural Disaster Insurance  Schemes In Indonesia,"natural disasters that occur experience a significant increase every year. likewise, the risk of natural disasters that occurs continues to increase. the increase that occurred was in the form of casualties and losses due to natural disasters. thus, a new alternative policy is needed as a mitigation effort to minimize the risk of disasters that occur. in this study, it aims to determine the alternative and efficient natural disaster management insurance scheme. the method used in natural disaster mitigation and insurance schemes is the systematic literature review. based on the research results, alternative natural disaster management requires synergy between the government and the community. so that it can form a disaster mitigation group that is responsive, active and resilient in implementing policies to anticipate natural disasters. meanwhile, the disaster insurance scheme uses a cross-subsidy system and the premium is charged to the local government. where, provinces with low economic growth while the potential for natural disasters are high can be helped and receive subsidies from provinces with high economic growth but low potential for natural disasters. so that areas with low economic growth while the potential for natural disasters are high, no longer need to be burdened with huge natural disaster insurance premiums.","natural disasters, casualties, losses, mitigation",,"kalfin doctor program of mathematics, faculty of mathematics and natural sciences, universitas padjadjaran, indonesia kalfin17001@mail.unpad.ac.id sukono, sudradjat supian department of mathematics, faculty of mathematics and natural sciences, universitas padjadjaran, indonesia sukono@unpad.ac.id; sudradjat@unpad.ac.id mustafa mamat faculty of informatics and computing, universiti sultan zainal abidin, kuala terengganu, malaysia must@unisza.edu.my abdul talib bon department of production and operations, university tun hussein onn malaysia, malaysia talibon@gmail.com","References

172,"E-Commerce Adoption Level In Smes Since Pandemic  Covid-19 Case In Bogor, Indonesia","the pandemic-covid 19 that begin in early of 2020 has caused economic growth to slow down in many sectors which in turn, lead to the increasing of unemployment. the outbreak is reshaping the industry in real-time, thus it has been forcing all the industries especially small medium enterprises (smes) to be able to better utilize digital platform or e-commerce for their business in order to sustain. previous study has indicated that smes e-commerce adoption level before pandemic occurred were in the stage 2 (e-interactivity) and predominantly being influenced by technological innovation factors. this study attempts to reconfirm the consistency of result from the previous study in a new pandemic situation. assessing the quantitative data drawn from 60 smes in bogor, this research has shown a decline of e-commerce adoption level to be in the stage-1 (e-window) and largely affected by organizational factors.","e-commerce, entrepreneurship, management","and Future Studies To be concluded, it is inferred that in this pandemic Covid-19, adoption of e-commerce for SMEs in Bogor were influenced positively only by Organizational Factor. The adoption level they were induced is in stage 1 as shown in Table 7 in which the highest value in this endogenous variable is Q1.3. Stage 1 or called E-Window reflects a company use static websites and one-way communication without any interactivity (Alrousan. Mohammad Kasem and Jones, 2016) This result shows a significant difference to the previous research done by Lolita et al (2019) who revealed the level of e-commerce adoption in SME’s Bogor before pandemic is in stage 2 with the highest factors contributed is Technological Innovation. There is a decline in adopting e-commerce before and after pandemic Covid-19 from stage 2 into stage 1. In terms of research contribution, the research might serve as a portrait of SMEs adoption level towards e-commerce during pandemic Covid-19. SMEs should begin to adapt the current pandemic situation by learning to implement new technologies. Other solution might be to change the business model to sell the higher demand product. As suggestion for government, free online learning should be provided to facilitate SMEs in adapting and adopting e-commerce. Moreover, government can establish a market place specialized for SMEs to sell their product along with providing business capital loan with lower-interest. These ways will prepare SMEs to compete in this pandemic covid-19 and hereafter. The main limitation of this study corresponds to the research area which only focused in Bogor with a very limited sample amount, which is only 61 from around 23.706 population. Thus, the sample may be biased because it is not sufficiently representing the population. Larger samples are recommended to yield more accurate finding. Besides that, further research using qualitative method might be more effective to gain deeper insights from SMEs to explore other factors that affect e-commerce adoption level.","kiki oktora, syafani putri lolita department of management, faculty of economics universitas pakuan, bogor indonesia kiki.oktora@unpak.ac.id; syafanilolita@gmail.com verni yuliaty ismail, muhammad refki novesar department of management, faculty of economics universitas yarsi, jakarta indonesia verni.yuliaty@yarsi.ac.id abdul talib bon department of production and operations, university tun hussein onn malaysia, malaysia talibon@gmail.com",

174,Determination Of Earthquake Insurance Premiums Using  The Bayesian Method,"earthquake is an unpredictable disaster. it made a lot of damage and loss. other than that, indonesia is surrounded by three world tectonic plates which makes it more likely to happen. therefore, we have to be preventive. one of solution that can be applied is to insure our assets to the insurance company as earthquake insurance. however, insurance company has to calculate premium amount which has to be paid by the clients. the aim of this research is to calculate the amount of premium using estimated loss of previous earthquake. this research uses bayesian method to estimate the loss amount which then used to calculate the premium. the result of this research is premium which is calculated using two principles, expected value principle and standard deviation principle. premium that is calculated using expected value principle is lower than standard deviation principle. however, the result is not absolute since there is still so many factors that are not included or other premium principles.","loss, insurance, premium","Based on the assumption, information II on the earthquake loss model is Pareto distribution with the parameter scale 𝑥𝑥𝑚𝑚= 40810 and an unknown shape 𝜃𝜃. The value of the shape parameter 𝜃𝜃 was estimated using the Bayesian method and the value of 𝜃𝜃෠= 3.0197 was obtained. The insurance premium in this study is calculated based on the estimated loss and chance of damage to the house due to the earthquake. The premium obtained from the principle of expected value has a smaller value but it is not necessarily beneficial for both parties. Therefore, it is necessary to re-examine the premium which is more effectively used for earthquake insurance by taking into account other factors.

175,Inventory Simulation Modelling For Local Shoes  Manufacturer,"covid-19 pandemic has made a major change in economic activities of small enterprises especially for local shoes manufacturers in indonesia. the changing sales mechanism from purchase order to online sales has significantly decreased their income. the pattern of online demand is probabilistic in nature. it needs a dynamic model to manage inventory level. this research is aimed to build a simulation model in inventory management for local shoes manufacturer using monte carlo simulation to find an inventory policy that provide lower total cost. simulation. we use spreadsheet to construct the simulation model and observes 20 period of sales demand. we also calculate carrying cost, ordering cost, and stock out cost of raw materials, then we run 500 simulations. the objective function of simulation process is to minimize total cost of inventory. by changing the order quantity ranging from 20 to 700 units, the lowest inventory cost is reached when the order quantity is 100 meters when lead time is 1-2 days. the inventory cost has a u-shaped curve where the cost is high when the order quantity is below 100 meters and increases when the order quantity is above 100 meters. the simulation modelling inventory management provides useful tool in analyzing an order policy which minimizes inventory cost when the nature of demand is probabilistic.","inventory, stochastic model, 2017)",Uncertainty in demand is a common nature in business practice. It requires a more complex model in inventory model to provide an effective decision making. Spreadsheet simulation model provide a useful information to estimate order quantity with minimum total inventory cost. The simulation model suggest that lead time has considerable effect on total inventory cost. Longer lead time would cause higher total inventory cost due to higher stockout cost. The difference of total minimum cost in terms of lead time is significant.,"yudhia mulya department of economics and business, pakuan university, indonesia yudhiamulya@unpak.ac.id sufiatul maryana vocational school, pakuan university, indonesia sufiatul.maryana@unpak.ac.id abdul talib bon department of production and operations, university tun hussein onn malaysia, malaysia talibon@gmail.com",

177,Estimated Value At Risk In Stock Investments  In An Insurance Company Using The Extreme Value Theory,"stocks as an investment product in the capital market have risks. therefore, investors must consider the return (yield) and the risk of an investment product. this research uses one of the methods of the extreme value theory (evt), namely peaks over threshold (pot) with the aim of estimating the value of risk in the general insurance company for the period 2016-2020. one method that can be used to measure the level of risk in stocks is the calculation of value. at risk (var). there are several calculation phases in this research, namely, the first is by calculating the return value based on the daily closing stock price of each company then doing descriptive statistical analysis and qq-plot to identify the characteristics of the stock return data. next, determine the threshold value to obtain extreme data and perform data suitability tests with generalized pareto distribution (gpd). then, estimate the parameters using the maximum likelihood method to calculate the var value. based on the research results, the smallest var value with a 99% confidence level is in the range of 4.94% to 5.70%.","return stocks, risiko, value at risk","Based on the results of the discussion in the previous chapter, it can be concluded that, seen from the characteristics of the return data based on the amount of skewness which is negative and kurtosis that exceeds the normal distribution, it indicates that the return data is heavy-tailed, that is, there is an extreme value so that the Extreme Value Theory method can be used to VaR calculation. Estimating the risk value using the EVT method by identifying the extreme value based on the Peak Over Threshold, the smallest VaR-GPD value is in the AXA company at 4.94% while PRU is 5.71% of current assets with a 99% confidence level.

178,Adomian Decomposition Method And The New Integral  Transform,"the adomian decomposition method is an iterative method that can be used to solve integral, differential, and integrodifferential equations. the differential equations that can be solved by this method can be of integer or fractional order, ordinary or partial, with initial or boundary value problems, with variable or constant coefficients, linear or nonlinear, homogeneous or nonhomogeneous. this method divides the equation into two forms, namely linear and nonlinear, so that it can solve equations without linearization, discretization, perturbation, or other restrictive assumptions. the basic concept of this method assumes that the solution can be decomposed into an infinite series. in particular, this method decomposes the nonlinear form (if any) of the equation with the adomian polynomial series. this decomposition method can be combined with various integral transform, such as laplace, sumudu, elzaki, and mohand. the main idea of this technique assumes that the solution can be decomposed into an infinite series, then applies the integral transform to the differential equation. the main advantage of this technique is that the solution can be expressed as an infinite series that converges rapidly to the exact solution. this paper aims to combine the adomian decomposition method with the new integral transform introduced by kashuri and fundo (2013). a scheme for solving fractional ordinary differential equations using the combined method is presented in this paper.",perturbation,"The Kashuri-Fundo decomposition method is a combination of the Adomian decomposition method and the Kashuri-Fundo integral transform.

179,Analysis Of The Factors Affecting The Money Supply In  Indonesia Using The Multiple Linear Regression Model,"the money supply in indonesia is a problem in the long-term economy and is influenced by many factors. this research was conducted with the aim of analyzing the effect of inflation, interest rates, and foreign exchange reserves on the money supply in indonesia. this research uses multiple linear regression analysis method, and parameter estimation is done by using ordinary least square (ols) method. the analysis was carried out using secondary data, in the form of time series data from the indonesian money supply, inflation rates, interest rates, and foreign exchange reserves. the data is obtained from bank indonesia (bi), the central bureau of statistics (bps) and other relevant sources. the results showed that the foreign exchange reserve, interest rate, and exchange rate variables simultaneously had a positive and significant effect on the money supply with probability values of 0.0048 and 0.0000. meanwhile, the inflation rate variable does not have a significant effect on the money supply in indonesia with a probability value of 0.0645.","money supply, inflation rate, interest rate","This study is intended to examine the influence of the foreign exchange reserves (𝑋𝑋1), Bank Indonesia certificate interest rates (𝑋𝑋2), inflation (𝑋𝑋3), and exchange rates (𝑋𝑋4), which have a very strong correlation with the money supply response variable (𝑌𝑌), that occurred in Indonesia in the period 1999 to 2019, using multiple linear regression models, and parameter estimation was carried out using the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) method. Based on the results of the data analysis that has been carried out, the following conclusions can be drawn. First, the foreign exchange reserves (𝑋𝑋1) has a positive and significant effect on the money supply in Indonesia with a coefficient value of 25.534012, which means that if GDP increases by 1 rupiah, the money supply increases by 25.534012 rupiahs. Second, the interest rate (𝑋𝑋2) by Bank Indonesia Certificates/Sertifikat Bank Indonesia (SBI) has a negative and significant effect on the money supply in Indonesia. The SBI elasticity coefficient of -8567.7971 shows that if the SBI is increased by 1%, the money supply will decrease by -8567.7971 rupiah. Third, the foreign exchange rate (𝑋𝑋4) has a positive impact on the money supply in Indonesia. The value of the foreign exchange rate (𝑋𝑋4) elasticity coefficient is 107.96988, which means that if the rupiah exchange rate increases it will increase the circulating amount of 107.96988 rupiahs.

180,On Line One Stop Government And Open Government   From Citizens Perspective,"the era of data disruption and the industrial revolution (ir) 4.0 provides an increasingly strong challenge for the government to prepare and optimize all its resources so that they are able to compete. likewise, local governments are aggressively making real efforts to meet the challenges of ir 4.0. one of the central government policies that continues to be passed down to regional governments is the policy regarding the development of on line one-stop services (on line one-stop government), which are integrated through an open government format. local governments of bogor city and bogor district are two of the local governments that have implemented on line one- stop government and open government. the main objective of this research is to conduct a comparative study on the implementation of on line one-stop government and open government. the method used is referring to open government maturity model (ogmm), and the case study is in the city and district of bogor, west java province, indonesia. the five basic principles of one-stop on line government have been implemented, although they have not yet fully succeeded in providing optimal services for the community. the basic principles referred to include downsizing, managerial, decentralization, debureaucratization and privatization processes. bogor city already has a one-stop on line service, and the document transaction process until the application status has been well managed. bogor district has completed the one-stop on line service with a video tutorial process, but document transactions are still done manually. the development of continuous studies to increase the value of data through the application of the big data concept to the open government system of bogor city and district is very potential to be carried out.","big data, maturity","The implementation of an open government system and one-stop on line service system is one of the results of the existence and strength of the influence of the era of data disruption and the challenges of RI 4.0. Bogor City and District have implemented open government and one-stop on line services. The basic principles of the successful implementation of an open government system and one-stop online service have become the foundation for its development. Proactive encouragement of citizens through various media and systems that have been facilitated by the City and District Governments. Bogor has been able to improve the function and quality of the system. The one- stop on line service system in Bogor Regency has been given a very popular name, namely OPTIMIS, equipped with a video tutorial system. This condition has increased the optimization of the system. OPTIMIS which is equipped with various social media to support activities and even online mass media also strengthens the foundation of the system. SiBadra and Laras are a form of the seriousness of the City and District Government of Bogor in realizing open government. The system built is managed in such a way as to become a personal system according to the perspective of the citizens. Through this system, the life-event metaphor becomes the strength of an open government. Strengthening the regulation of one-stop on line services, enabling this activity to accumulate knowledge based on participation and collaboration. Contests, social networks and social vote activities are one solution to various problems.","(case: bogor city and district, west java, indonesia) eneng tita tosida, fajar delli wihartiko department of computer science, faculty of mathematics and natural sciences, universitas pakuan, indonesia enengtitatosida@unpak.ac.id; fajardelli@unpak.ac.id abdul talib bon department of production and operations, university tun hussein onn malaysia, malaysia talibon@gmail.com",

184,The Caracteristics Of Alpha Cut On Fuzzy Graphs And Its  Application In Scheduling System,"this article discusses the characteristics of alpha-cut on fuzzy graph. alpha-cut on fuzzy graph was introduced by munoz (2005) for vertex coloring on fuzzy graph with crips vertices. it was continued by arindam dey, et all (2013) for the fuzzy set of vertices and edges. alpha-cut on fuzzy graph is crips graphs gα that are induced from fuzzy graph by removing all vertex and edges in fuzzy graphs that have a degree of membership less than α, α∈[0,1]. therefore, the caracteristics of alpha-cut on fuzzy graph is related to the crips graph produced. furthermorer alpha cut on fuzzy graph will produce many ways of scheduling. key words: alpha-cut, fuzzy graph, degree of membership, crips graph, scheduling 1. introduction fuzzy graphs were introduced by azriel rosenfeld in his book entitled fuzzy graph (1975). the theoretical concept of fuzzy graph is based on fuzzy logic in fuzzy sets introduced by zadeh l. a. (1965). since the introduction of fuzzy graphs, many studies in classical graphs have been generalized into fuzzy graphs. one of the generalized studies is the vertex coloring. the problem of vertex coloring on a graph is a problem of finding the smallest integer k ∈ n, so two adjacent vertices have different labels. this smallest number is called as chromatic number. vertex coloring on fuzzy graphs was introduced by munoz, s., et al (2005). one of the vertex coloring concepts on fuzzy graphs introduced by munoz, s., et al. (2005) is the use of alpha-cut on fuzzy graphs based on the definition of aplha-cut on fuzzy sets. the fuzzy graph used in the research of munoz, s., et al. (2005) is a fuzzy graph with a set of crips vertex. furthermore, dey, a., et al. (2013) developed a definition of alpha-cut on fuzzy graphs for a fuzzy set of vertex and edge. this article discusses some of the α-cut characteristics in fuzzy graphs using definition from dey, a., et al (2013) and it is applied on scheduling system. 2. definitions definition 1. let v be non empty and finite set. a fuzzy graph gf is a pair of functions (σ, µ) with σ is the fuzzy set on v and µ is a symmetric fuzzy relation on σ, in such a way that: i. σ: v → [0, 1] ii. µ : v × v → [0,1] that fulfil { } ( ) ( ) , , ( ) , i j i j min µ v v v v σ σ ≤ for any , . i j v v v ∈ furthermore, σ it is called the set of fuzzy vertices and µ is called the set of fuzzy edges. a fuzzy graph with a set of fuzzy vertices and a set of fuzzy edges is then denoted by gf = (σ, µ). the notation σ(vi) on a fuzzy graph states the proceedings of the 2nd african international conference on industrial engineering and operations management harare, zimbabwe, december 7-10, 2020 © ieom society international 1927",,"α-cut on the fuzzy graph GF = (σ, µ) is the set family of crips graphs Gα = (Vα, Eα). Vertex coloring on a fuzzy graph using α-cut can be used to design a fuzzy scheduling system. Vertex coloring algorithm on a fuzzy graph using α-cut produces a fuzzy chromatic number that represents the set of several pairs of the number of time intervals in scheduling with the value α.","triyani, nurshiami s. n, and larasati, n. department of mathematics, faculty of mathematics and natural science jenderal soedirman university central java, indonesia triyani@unsoed.ac.id abdul talib bon department of production and operations, university tun hussein onn malaysia, malaysia talibon@gmail.com",

187,Simulation Of An Extraction System Using An Internet Of Things  (Iot) Device For Automatic Control And Alarm Management For,"this paper presents simulations to model the performance of two negative pressure, airborne infectious isolation rooms (aiirs). aiirs are a requirement for the medical management of covid and other infectious diseases mobilization of functional aiirs have therefore become a health infrastructure priority over the last year. a standard negative pressure room with a single fan for extraction, ceiling level supply air and extraction diffusers is compared to a dual extraction fan system with variable air control linked to pressure sensors via an iot controller. computational fluid dynamics (cfd) is used to simulate the ventilation performance of both configurations. these results are then compared to results from experimental studies on live isolation rooms monitored and controlled via iot devices. the results indicate that the dual extraction configuration with iot control is more energy efficient and effective at maintaining the required negative pressure parameters.","aiir, extraction systems","This simulation evaluated the performance of an airborne infectious isolation rooms using CFD and experimental verification. The two scenarios tested a typical constant volume negative pressure isolation room and a dual extraction fan system with IOT control and monitoring. Both configurations were tested using numerical methods and then experimentally verified. Previous studies have analyzed the locations of the supply and exhaust positions as well as the impact of door motion. This study addressed a solution to the impact of door motion. The research has shown that the addition of an additional fan and the IOT controller improves the performance of the AIIR by reducing the spread of the contaminants into adjacent areas and eliminated the additional energy consumption and operational effect of an oversized system to compensate for air leakage and pressure loss due to door motion.

189,Service Landscape Online Ordering System Based On Cloud  Technology,"one of the things that can support the quality of service in a restaurant is the ordering process. the process of ordering places and food that is done manually is undoubtedly vulnerable to instability in a restaurant’s quality of service. unfortunately, this is still widely used in restaurants, especially local restaurants, due to the minimal technology investment they can afford. cloud technology is the answer to this problem. technology cloud has been widely used, such as in financial systems, marketing systems, and clinical reservation systems, all of which target small companies so that they can implement the technology at a minimal cost. this study developed a service landscape architecture for an online ordering system based on cloud technology that allows small restaurants to implement an online order system for their respective businesses. after the analysis process, we get one business process, four business domains, 12 business functions, and 40 business service functions. researchers are very confident that this service will become a reference in creating a cloud-based platform for food ordering systems at many local restaurants.",service landscape,"This study presents a service landscape of an online ordering system at a restaurant. The proposed service is based on Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) and cloud services. SOA provides the advantage of increasing integration and flexibility, reducing message waiting times, and eliminating redundant data Cloud with Software as a Service (SaaS) services takes care of scalability, performance, security, availability, system monitoring requirements and reduces software maintenance costs (Appandairaj and Murugappan 2013) This research process was carried out for three months from January 2020 to March 2020, resulting in a service landscape consisting of one business area, four business domains, 12 business capabilities, 40 service functions. This condition will become the foundation for entrepreneurs in the culinary field to choose their services within an online ordering system with integration, equipped with a cloud-based platform architecture with software as a Service service. This landscape service can use in various restaurants through government or private initiatives.

190,Increasing Sales Online Through Integration Of  Dropshipping System And Social Media,"dropshipping is an order fulfillment method that does not need a business to keep products in stock. dropshipping is mostly done in the fashion industry, ready-to-eat food, handicrafts, and so on. dropshipping makes it easy for beginner entrepreneurs to start their business activities without having inventory costs first. the hallmark of drop shipping is running its activities online, so the logical consequence is that a well-computerized system is needed. many previous studies have discussed this dropshipping system. still, most of them limit their case studies to specific products in certain areas and do not handle dropshipping business promotion technology. this research produces a mobile-based dropshipping system that can be used freely and integrated with other social media platforms to expand the drop shipping brand name's promotional reach. an evaluation of the dropshipping system built showed that integration with other social media platforms increased the total sales figures of the dropshipping businesses studied, with an average of nearly 20% of evaluations carried out over one month. the application of blockchain technology to this system is one of the next leading suggestions for improving existing transactions' security. keyword dropshipping system, integration, social media marketing 1. introduction dropshipping is a useful instrument used to process online orders for retailers (li, zhang, & liu, 2019). the agency can save holding, processing, and obsolescence costs for the retailer (li, zhang, & liu, 2019). although they may have their warehouses and distribution centers, many online retailers also benefit from drop-shipping because the instrument allows them to expand their product lines considerably without increasing inventory or warehouse costs (li, zhang, & liu, 2019). with the development of e-commerce, financial constraints are the main problem for online retailers, and limited working capital often constrains online retailers' procurement decisions. as a new order fulfillment method, dropshipping benefits the whole supply chain due to risk-pooling effects when a wholesaler supplies multiple retailers (zeng, gong, & xu, 2019). the dropship system, which the perpetrator is often called a drop shipper, is an online buying and selling system where running an online business with this system does not require capital because running this system does not provide a stock of goods (deddy prihadi, 2018). unlike resellers, drop shippers only sell information on these products without buying goods like a reseller. dropshipping is mostly done in the fashion industry, ready-to-eat food, crafts, books, office equipment, and so on. one of the most prominent advantages of a drop ship is the lack of capital or even not spending money at all. still, because the dropship does not buy the goods first, the drop shipper does not control the goods, which causes dependence on suppliers. overriding the shortcomings of the dropship is a way to market products with minimal capital (triyanto, 2017). online marketing is an alternative to expand market share so that the sales process does not only occur in a specific place and time. many large and small companies have used a website-based or mobile sales system. they are utilizing technology to expand product marketing. proceedings of the 2nd african international conference on industrial engineering and operations management harare, zimbabwe, december 7-10, 2020 © ieom society international 1974",,"This study evaluates the system for 30 days. Before the integrated system, the sales turnover is Rp.13,500,000. After using the integrated system, social media, Facebook, the turnover achieved in the same period, Rp.16,200,000. From the results of the evaluation, there was an increase in sales turnover by 20%. The increase occurred because the platform users themselves could only see product promotions in the previous system. After incorporating on the Facebook social media, the upgrades carried out can be seen by more people. Based on the research conducted, the drop shipper system integrated with social media can increase sales figures by creating posts on dropship online stores. Those are directly connected to Facebook social media so that users on the dropship system alone can see the latest posts. This research hopes that the integrated system can expand the product marketing area compared to the market planned to increase sales figures. The application of blockchain technology to this system is one of the next leading suggestions for improving existing transactions' security. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 Week-1 Week-2 Week-3 Week-4 Non Integrated System Integrated System Proceedings of the 2nd African International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management Harare, Zimbabwe, December 7-10, 2020","faiza renaldi, rival muhamad saepuloh, agya java maulidin department of informatics, universitas jenderal achmad yani, indonesia faiza.renaldi@unjani.ac.id, rivalmuhamad17@student.unjani.ac.id , java.maulidin@student.unjani.ac.id abdul talib bon department of production and operations, university tun hussein onn malaysia, malaysia talibon@gmail.com","References

191,Combining Search Engine Optimization And Humancomputer Interaction On An Ecommerce Site: A Mini,"the rapid development of technology in industrial revolution 4.0 made the business competition even tighter, especially for primary needs, one of which is the local industry is engaged in fashion. many fashion industries use ecommerce (ec) but have not increased their sales because the primary key to sales is useful marketing techniques. many scientists who research one ec development with seo but only pay attention to rankings do not increase sales. in this study, we implement the seo method with indexing, crawling, and meta tags techniques collaborated with the user interface using the silo structure technique and spoke and hub structure. the purpose of doing so is to make customers feel more comfortable browsing the ec web. this research investigates the possibility of applying those techniques to the sales in a 6-month mini longitudinal study. we found out that this combination has increased the ec monthly income by 4 to 10% each month. it can be concluded that the seo method will be more optimal in collaboration with other techniques such as the silo structure technique and spoke and hub structure. suggestions for further research are collaborating seo with other social media integration methods and location-based services to benefit an ec establishment.","ecommerce, zimbabwe","This study, which was carried out for six months, resulted in a relatively good increase in visits, unique visits, and scores, even though sprints five and seven experienced a decrease in the number of visits because we experimented with the meta keys and descriptions to not correlate to one another. The more SEO techniques used, the higher the SEO score obtained, and the more meta keys and definitions used, the more visits that will visit with the terms meta key and description made must have a relationship with each other. HCI improvement can convert visits to unique visits because, in every sprint, there are always the same visitors returning to the website, and the most massive increase in visits occurred on the 8th sprint in August 2020. This increase in visits can occur because We have implemented several SEO techniques such as indexing, crawling, and meta tags to optimize crawling. We create a file called robots.txt; this file is designed to control or control user agents as google bot in crawling web pages. Although the case study was carried out at a clothing shop, this technique can be applied to other cases. For example, we can apply this technique to the tourism sector using E-Tourism as a medium to support programs that have been determined by the government to attract more tourists. HCI is imperative as it plays a significant role in helping the applications we make to stand out more and make users feel comfortable and create impressions for users who use them. In this longitudinal study, We have also improved the existing HCI by promoting the usability principle. Good HCI has the criteria for user-friendly and high usability(Haryoko 2012). User friendly is the ability that software or application programs have that are easy to operate and have many other skills to feel at home in managing the program, even for a novice user. At the same time, usability is the system’s ability to meet user needs (Handiwidjojo and Ernawati 2016). From the results observed by We, it can be concluded that the Steigen store system that has been improved by SEO and HCI can help increase the score and ranking of the previously created web. Finally, there is an increase in the number of customer loyalty. The increase in customers can be seen from the number of unique visits on each sprint. 5.","longitudinal study faiza renaldi, angga fantiya hermawan, agya java maulidin department of informatics, universitas jenderal achmad yani, indonesia faiza.renaldi@unjani.ac.id, angga.fantiya@student.unjani.ac.id, java.maulidin@student.unjani.ac.id abdul talib bon department of production and operations, university tun hussein onn malaysia, malaysia talibon@gmail.com",
192,Integrating Travel Booking Management System Using  Rest-Api,"many traveling arrangements can be made online at this time, such as lodging, transportation, and choosing tourist attractions. studies on online tourism systems discuss a lot about booking service systems at hotel reservations, transportation reservations, or booking tour tickets. however, most of these studies were carried out only on individual processes and were not integrated. this study built a web service for travel package booking that allows travelers to book transportation, hotels, and travel tickets in one transaction. the use of api technology combines parameters from ordering a travel package, then carrying out a comprehensive calculation. in the end, travelers will get many options to combine their travel packages automatically. in this study, the validity of the api was tested. testing the api built resulted in an average time of 2946 ms from 50 trials of api calls by ten different users accessing the system simultaneously. we suggest adding api connections with providers of travel location review information so that more details will be available in one particular place. keyword api-based system, travel package, order management system 1. introduction web services are software systems designed to support machine-to-machine interactions that operated over a network (chen et al. 2017). the web service has an interface described in a machine-processable format (paik et al. 2017). in this modern era, web services have been used in various fields such as e-commerce (sohaib and kang 2017), online payment (listyani et al. 2016), and data provider (perwira and santosa 2017). web service is a system built to manage data or perform an operation based on the requests. then the client retrieves the result of the process (jianxiao liu et al. 2016). we can find this thing in the microservices concept. the advantage of using a web service is that application developers do not need to create a difficult function to perform if there is already a web service that can do similar work. for example, when a group of developers wants to do a payment module for an application they are developing, they can take advantage of a web service that can handle payment transactions such as midtrans. there are two types of web services that are widely used, namely, soap (simple object access protocol) and rest (representational state transfer) (rafalimanana et al. 2020). soap is an xml based protocol, while rest is an architectural based protocol. also, the soap protocol is http and smtp, and ftp, while rest is http. so far, web services are widely used as a backend in microservice systems. it provides the advantages of good system modularity, easy maintenance, and good scalability. thus, web services are used as a system capable of handling specific tasks based on client requests so that the software on the client can have a good performance. one web service that is widely used is rest-api (hu et al. 2017). the rest-api is very popular because it is easy to use, easy to understand, and has better performance (neumann et al. 2018). apart from that, the rest-api also allows sending data using a lightweight data format such as json (barbaglia et al. 2016), which allows for easier parsing (jian liu et al. 2019). the rest-api uses the http methodology defined by the rfc 2616 protocol, like: get to retrieve resources; put to modify resources; post to create a new resource; and delete to delete resources (putra and putera 2019). to run the rest-api, the client needs to run a url that points to a designated method. this process is known as a request. then, the client will receive data. this data is known as a response. one example of its use is a weather application that gets data about the weather from a web service via an api. proceedings of the 2nd african international conference on industrial engineering and operations management harare, zimbabwe, december 7-10, 2020 © ieom society international 1996",,"This study aims to complete the integration between hotel booking transactions, transportation bookings, and tour ticket bookings, which previously we had to do one by one. Therefore they become integrated so that transactions can be made simultaneously as one transaction. We have presented an approach to integrating hotel booking, transportation booking, and tour ticket booking using web service technology with REST architecture. Web service provides services that can be used by clients based on their needs. It offers an opportunity for the use of web services as a tool for integration. By using RESTful web service technology, web services can be accessed easily by clients with different platforms to perform certain operations. The solution to this problem is implemented in the user software using Rest-API technology. The use of Rest-API technology provides convenience in terms of scalability and reusability in software development. We tested the validity of the built API. Testing is done by testing API calls. The API call testing conducted found that the average time was 2946 ms from 50 trial calls by ten different users accessing the system simultaneously. This study created a web service that integrates hotel booking, transportation booking, and tour ticket booking. This study answers the gap from previous research. We hope that this study contributes to a more in-depth analysis of the REST web service's scalability attributes. For further investigation, we recommend adding API connections with the providers of travel location review information so that more details will be available in one particular place.","faiza renaldi, hary suryanto, agya java maulidin, irma santikarama department of informatics, universitas jenderal achmad yani, indonesia faiza.renaldi@unjani.ac.id, harysuryanto@student.unjani.ac.id, java.maulidin@student.unjani.ac.id, irma.santikarama@lecture.unjani.ac.id abdul talib bon department of production and operations, university tun hussein onn malaysia, malaysia talibon@gmail.com",
193,Internet Presence Monitoring: Application Of Heuristic  Genetic Algorithm To Increase Efficiency In Work,"an effective supervisory function must allocate workload efficiently and optimize limited work hours with respect to a variety of operational requirements. these requirements often vary and entails a fast and dynamic model to be considered effective. work allocation has typically been accomplished either through manual planning with considerations or constraints of very limited complexity, or by deterministic methods; requiring inordinate amounts of work hours which are typically incapable of adapting to changes in the environment. the methods and models presented here utilize forecasting techniques, analytic hierarchy process, and genetic algorithm (as search heuristic) to find a good sufficient allocation solution that can be performed quickly in rapidly changing process environment. improvements introduced in this paper is projected to save 84 hours’ worth of work per month.","heuristics, genetic algorithm, et al.","In conclusion, the methodology introduced in the study led to significant improvements in the allocation process and is being considered as a framework to approach other processes. Several analytical tools and techniques were used to solve a number of pain points in the allocation process. The following summarizes these and corresponding pain points it was able to solve: • Standardization dealt with inaccurate measurement of work; • Posterior probability dealt with predicting possible changes that could impact work; • Analytic Hierarchy Process dealt with leveraging existing capacity to increase efficiency and accuracy; • Net Capacity dealt with estimating how much can be done; and • Genetic Algorithm (a search heuristic) dealt with automating the process of finding the right combination of work and/or allocation variables.

194,Internal Audit Resource Allocation Model   Using Linear Programming,"this study utilized a linear programming (lp) model for the assignment of internal audit staff to different audit projects with varying complexities and skill level requirements. numerous auditor allocation studies proposed models that minimized the cost, however, since the internal audit function is not a revenue-generating function, the efficiency ratings of each audit staff were used and converted these into regrets ratings which were later on used as factors in solving this allocation problem. the lingo 18.0 software was used to determine the proper allocation of audit staff that will maximize the audit efficiency for a mid-sized internal audit department. the results of this study were presented to the director of the internal audit department who plans to use this model to get further insights on whether the model will be beneficial in optimizing the audit staff allocation as well as improve the overall quality and efficiency of the internal audit function as compared to the current traditional manual allocation process.","internal audit, allocation, audit staff, efficiency, quality","The allocation of internal audit resources continues to be a complex and critical process in achieving audit quality and efficiency. With the recent advancement in technology, new risks started to emerge which caused more complexities in business operations and regulatory requirements. As such, internal auditors are now under pressure to raise the bar of their audit quality to cope up with the fast face of this technological revolution. In this study, an LP model was used to obtain an optimal solution in allocating internal audit staff that would maximize the audit quality of the internal audit function. In addition, this new method significantly improved the time spent in the allocation of the internal audit resources, a process that normally takes hours if not days to complete using the traditional manual allocation process. The results of this study can be used to further assist internal audit management to assess whether the organization has sufficient manpower to deliver expected audit output, determine proper audit staff workload and the right mix of projects that would support the growth and development of each audit staff. Further, the efficiencies obtained from using this model can be used to other activities that could further add value to the company or organization as a whole. The results of this study were presented to the Director of the internal audit department who agreed to consider the use the mathematical methods in their next audit planning activity. The model allocation results will be observed further to see whether it will help in optimizing the audit staff allocation problem as well as improve the overall quality and efficiency of the internal audit function.","frederick m. baldo and rex aurelius c. robielos school of industrial engineering and engineering management mapua university intramuros, manila, philippines fbaldo824@gmail.com,racrobielos@mapua.edu.ph",

This paper also utilized the analytic hierarchy process to help sales personnel identify priority industry selling area to maximize the useful life of network equipment. This study has determined the optimal values of various decision variables of a revenue maximization model and put it to use in the optimal allocation of a manpower allocation model. This highlights the importance of manpower in the achievement of sales targets as enablers and implementers of sales activities. It showed that while calculating the optimal number and selling price of products to be sold is relevant, assigning it to the available manpower makes it meaningful. It aligned the achievement of individual sales quotas of the agents and of the general sales objective of the company while satisfying all the identified constraints. Given the allocation of manpower per selling area; a relevant sales quota per sales agent were arrived at. This quota per sales agent has enabled a more defined quota instead of merely having quota per selling industry. Furthermore, the prioritization schedule devised using AHP will help the manpower to allot their time in focusing on selling first products in the priority industry selling areas. This will enable the sales agents to reach their quotas, as well as contribute in maximizing the useful life of the company’s network equipment.

197,Utilization Of Analytic Hierarchy Process (Ahp) With Linear  Regression For Determining Category To Maximize Potential,"this study utilizes the analytic hierarchy process (ahp) in the selection of an optimal niche or category of videos for maximizing view count. main income from videos are derived from rpm, which is a set amount per a thousand views. a set of criteria was determined from attributes of the dataset that logically contributes to either the videos’ seo or in trend/popularity. the criteria in question was also determined by commonalities in a vast amount of video content platforms, which focuses more on the essential attributes of a video. in order to perform pairwise comparison, weights were derived from coefficients generated from using linear regression. upon creation of the model, we identify the categories that have the most potential for garnering views. based on results, the study may be performed in another time frame to reflect the major shifts in public interest over time. thus, importance to its repeatability and degree of usability against datasets from different platforms is emphasized.",share,"The utilization of Linear Regression for estimating weights in AHP proved to be a good approach for processing data generated from high-traffic, social media platforms. It can remove biases that can come from small sample sizes such as surveys directed to a handful of executives. The more data-driven research becomes, it is inherently more reliable, and can be easily implemented in other industries or subject matter. The independent variables in the study were chosen with the importance of being able to apply the methodology across different video platforms, as well as be easy to repeat in periodic time frames. This is to easily capture shifts in trends, changes in categorization, as well as changes in how videos are measured. From this study, we have found out, for the dataset used, video length does not matter as much to view count. Also, we have found out that while some attributes have weights consistent across most categories, like search engine optimization related attributes (title, tags), some categories value other attributes more than that of other categories. This can be useful to media companies, or other individuals who peruse the methods in this study, to selectively control how a production should be made for the categories they have selected. It can also be noted that the study did not select a singular category. Instead, the study presents the top categories by its composite weight.

198,Optimization Of The Allocation Of Production Specialist  Working In A Semiconductor Company Under The,"manufacturing is the processing of raw materials to finished products. originally, these products were processed manually until industrial revolution has allowed these products to be produced by machines. most of the manufacturing lines in the industries use the combination of manual processing and machine processing. this is referred to as semi-automated production line. thus, there are two factors affecting the productivity of this production line- manpower and machine efficiency. during the covid-19 pandemic, skeletal workforce was strictly implemented in almost every sector across the globe. reassignment of manpower allocation has therefore been a problem of the management. this paper focuses on manpower allocation of a bumping area of a semiconductor company in the philippines. factors affecting manpower allocation such as maximum machine capacity, minimum output requirement and number of qualified production specialist were studied and taken into consideration. using linear programming, optimal number of manpower was determined and the target output of 64,000 unit moves daily was achieved. however, this can be further improved by utilizing the excess production specialist through cross-training them in different module. machine capacity can also be maximized by hiring more production specialist to operate on them.",linear programming,"In conclusion, allocation of production specialist per module is dependent on the machine capacity however; it is also limited by the number of production specialist qualified in every module. There is no direct relationship between the number of allocated production specialist per module and minimum output requirement per module. In this model, goal of allocating at least one production specialist per module was achieved. The target of 64,000 moves per day was doubled into 129,092 moves while machine capacity and minimum output requirement per module were satisfied. However, this can be further improved by maximizing the utilization of machine capacity. This will result to greater output of the production line. It is suggested to hire more production specialists and to cross train them across the modules.","compressed skeletal workforce schedule using linear programming katrina laurain gaspar and rex aurelius c. robielos school of industrial engineering and engineering management mapua university intramuros, manila, philippines racrobielos@mapua.edu.ph",
199,Life Insurance Policy/Products Selection Using Analytical  Hierarchy Process (Ahp),"in today’s tough competition, every company in the service sector tries hard to satisfy their customer. in the insurance sector, various new private companies have entered in industry by doing the merger with foreign companies. day by day they are offering new services with the basic plan to attract the new customers & for retaining the present customers. in this research paper, we tried to understand the consumer behavior in the insurance sector. the main objective of this paper is to utilize the analytical hierarchy process to select the factors to consider when buying a life insurance policy based on different age brackets and gender orientation. data was collected with the help of structured questionnaires from 48 clients of lazurite keystone. researchers used pairwise, percentage, frequency & cross tabulation methods have been used for analysis. the proposed model can help the firm in selecting the efficient products. ahp is a multicriteria decision making tool that takes into account both qualitative and quantitative criteria.",,"This research study is aimed at assessing the important criteria and sub criteria for selection of insurance policy/products, using AHP Method. The model is specifically designed to identify the important criteria in choosing products to evaluate the client's preference when buying life insurance. This model is tested on 5 products which are offered of lazurite keystone life insurance, where data collection begins; through existing clients survey by considering their age bracket and gender orientation, the information needed to begin developing the proposed model is obtained, and the most important criteria and sub criteria for the problem assessment process have been identified. The hierarchical structure is provided with the participation of decision makers, followed by the comparison corresponding to criteria and sub criteria. Furthermore, the consistency of paired matrix results has been confirmed. In each criteria and sub-criteria, priority/ selection analysis is used to obtain relative importance of the comparison matrix. Therefore, to determine the objective function according to ranking alternatives and relative priorities, the proposed model was tested in all products to assess the client's preference when buying life insurance policy/products. By using the equation in the previous discussion, which represents the objective function, the general goal of this to select the life insurance policy is achieved. After developing the AHP Model, the predetermined objectives have also been achieved. Due to this limitation, it was important to know the use of case study, as the model should not be used generally for situations and other outside segments that are used. In addition, it is difficult to collect all interview participants together at the same time; because it is a structured group interview, there are many cases where participants cannot be involved simultaneously. Another limitation is the need for all research participants involved in the process to commit to it. As a contribution, this study highlights the adoption of multi-criteria methodologies used to identify the performance score, ranking and to normalize alternatives.

200,Sales Maximization Through Service Tier Introduction  Utilizing Lp Model And Ahp-Based After Sales Pursuit,"this study aims to use available company data on annual sales from after sales service subscriptions in countries within the asia pacific region. it is also aimed to identify optimal solution in maximizing the annual sales through service tiers introduction using the linear programming approach. to realize the optimal solution, this study intends to utilize analytical hierarchy process (ahp) in prioritizing the different alternatives for after sales pursuit strategy implementation per country. the set of criteria was determined using the predictive analytics approach. it was concluded that the annual sales per country in the asia pacific region is largely influenced by the number of customer subscriptions. the result of this study is applicable to the proposal being made to meet the company goal of increasing service adoption through service tiers introduction to increase the annual sales of at least 15% in asia pacific. since the number of customer subscription has a positive effect on increasing annual sales, the outcome of the ahp-based after sales pursuit strategy implementation may be used by the company as a customized approach in capturing the targeted sales per country.","tier introduction, sales optimization, linear programming","This study proved that in order to meet the company’s annual sales target of at least 10% increase per country and 15% increase in the Asia Pacific region, service tiers can be introduced by maximizing the annual total sales using Linear Programming. Utilizing AHP also proved that the approach in implementing pursuit strategies should not be treated equally and ranking can be customized per country based on the given criteria. The Linear Programming and Analytical Hierarchy Process models generated from this study can be implemented and monitored for adoption effectiveness. And after some time, use these models for the other world areas and product lines in the company. For future optimization studies, it is recommended to incorporate external factors and customer feedback to improve the models. LP and AHP should become an essential analysis and decision-making tools in a company. Model-based decision is important for its accuracy and objectivity. Qualitative decisions like subjective estimation, intuition, and trial and error are commonly used by companies. It is an eye-opening concern that such decision-making approach is not widely used, thus, policy makers in the companies should start to shift to model-based decision-making styles (Maurya et al., 2016).","strategy selection pebbles quimpo, patrick santos, marien tagaban and rex aurelius c. robielos school of industrial engineering and engineering management mapua university intramuros, manila, philippines pebsquimpo@gmail.com, pa3cksantos@gmail.com, marientagaban@gmail.com, racrobielos@mapua.edu.ph",
201,Prediction Of Credit Card Status Changes Using Markov  Analysis,"credit cards is one of the most convenient tools when purchasing goods and services. banks offer these cards to qualified individuals and gain profit by charging interest rates and fees. profit and loss may occur depending on the changes in status of the card. to understand the behavior of credit card status changes and predict future probabilities, this study utilized markov analysis approach by gathering 6 months of information with 511,658 observations. the transition of the card status can either positively or negatively impact the business. markov analysis proved to be useful in understanding the behavior of people and systems. it provides probabilistic information about a current situation that can guide the decision makers in choosing the most valuable recommendation. in this study there is a high percentage of normal/active, delinquency and blocked cards which means an increase in the business revenue. fraudulent and cancelled blocked cards projected a lower value and should maintain in that way because it may affect not just business earnings but its reputation as well. the analysis presented provides useful information to improve process performance that is current implemented in the business operations. generally, the model can help the financial institution in terms of profitability, customer relationships and risk reduction.","banks, credit card, markov analysis","To observe the behavior of the credit card status changes and identify which status has the highest probability of change, Markov Analysis approach was used for the business to determine the effect of each status changes. Analyzing the credit card statuses and identifying which status has the highest and lowest probability of change, the business can strategize on how to minimize future negative impact of these cards and maintain and maximize the positive output the business is doing. Depending on where the credit card status transitions to, it is observed that these transitions can either positively or negatively impact the business. Having the initial state values of the card to predict the future outcomes, gives the company an edge on how to act according to which transition poses a threat to the business. This paper has described how the information can be used to predict future probabilities and take strategic measures to further improve the business. The researchers recommend utilizing Markov Analysis for businesses who wants to understand the behavior of their systems. Systems such as credit card status changes, movements of people, customer brand switching, inventories etc. It is important to note that having the initial state values first is essential for the prediction of future probabilities. Deep analysis must be done to fully understand on how and why the changes are happening. This approach would be useful to identify the risk and opportunities and improve the business’ current position.

202,Determining Priority Export Sectors For The Philippines  Using Analytic Hierarchy Process (Ahp),"prioritization of export sectors enables export promotion agencies to allocate scarce resources to sectors and activities that need it most. this paper utilized analytic hierarchy process (ahp) to determine the priority export sectors for the philippines based on the following criteria: (i) export value added; (ii) export competitiveness; (iii) export demand; and (iv) supply capacity. to provide a more granular analysis, sub-criteria were also identified as follows: labor value added, domestic value added, and stable export revenue are used as sub-criteria for export value added; comparative advantage and market concentration for export competitiveness; growth of world imports, distance to importing countries, and tariff rate for export demand; and growth of philippine exports per sector, logistics cost, and gross value added of each sector for supply capacity. individual weights of each criteria and sub-criteria were computed and applied to relevant trade and export statistics to determine the priority ranking of each sector. consistent with historical data, the result shows that the most important export sectors for the philippines are machinery and electrical, agricultural, and food products.","export planning, 1967, michaely","This paper proposes a new methodology for prioritizing export sectors using Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). Four main criteria were identified, namely: export value added, export competitiveness, export demand, and supply capacity. To provide a deeper evaluation of the different sectors, different sub-criteria were also determined. Export value added was further decomposed into labor value added, domestic value added, and export revenue. Export competitiveness was further elaborated using Revealed Comparative Advantage and market concentration indicators. Export demand was modeled based on the average growth rate of world demand for each export sector, the average distance of importing countries, and tariff rate as proxy for market access conditions. Finally, supply capacity was determined using the average growth of Philippine exports for each sector, the logistics cost, and the productive capacity which used the gross value added of each sector as proxy indicator. Applying the weights of the criteria mentioned on relevant trade data obtained from various sources, performance scores were computed and were used as the basis for ranking the export sectors, as follows: (1) Machinery and Electronics; (2) Agriculture; (3) Food Products; (4) Footwear; (5) Fuels; (6) Chemicals, Plastics, and Rubber; (7) Metals and Minerals; (8) Transportation Equipment; and (9) Textiles and Clothing. Prioritization of these export sectors can be an important input to export planning and promotion. Given the government’s limited resources for export development, a prior analysis of which sectors to focus on will help ensure that resources are invested efficiently and effectively, for instance, in the selection of matching and market missions. Moreover, looking at the results and ranking for each criterion (and its sub-criteria) would also inform policy makers about the more specific challenges facing each sector and with further analysis would be able to formulate strategies to address those challenges.","ronnel b. ruanes and rex aurelius c. robielos school of industrial engineering and engineering management mapua university intramuros, manila, philippines rbruanes@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, racrobielos@mapua.edu.ph",
203,Naïve Bayes Classifier For Predicting Success Factors Of  Engineering Education: Belgian Example,"this research attempts to understand the underlying factors influencing the success of engineering education. in doing so, it analyzes the available data regarding the non-mandatory positioning test, which was introduced at the belgian universities for engineering programs in summer 2013. predictive model learning algorithms are used to make prediction for unseen data. in this research naïve bayes based algorithm is used to predict the contributing factors for the success in engineering education. the result shows that the prior academic achievement (choosing option of higher hours in mathematics, percentage of marks in mathematics in high school) of the students influences the score of the test. it also shows that the score of the test along with prior mathematical experience is a good predictor for the success and failure of students in engineering education. moreover, the research finds that the test score has a high predictive power for the result of engineering study especially for the students who are more likely to do badly. on the other hand, the results indicate that gender is not an obstacle in study success in engineering education. this study finds that the girls who do conduct higher hours of mathematics in their high school and go for the engineering study do equally well as boys.",,"The research provides the implementation of predictive learning algorithms in order to search for the engineering study success indicators. This implementation is achieved by Naïve Bayes based classifier. The first classifier is built to predict the test score based on the prior academic achievement and gender. The result shows that the classifier can predict both pass and fail of positioning test equally well. However, the contribution of gender is observed very low. Even without considering gender, the classifier provides similar accuracy in predicting pass and fail of the positioning test score. Therefore, the prior academic achievement, not the gender of the students influences the score of the positioning test score. The second classifier is constructed to predict the first year result of bachelor based on the test score and prior academic achievement. For realizing the predictive power of the test score, similar classifier is also built without using this score. The comparison of both classifiers shows that the overall accuracy of the classifier is lower when they are trained without using the test score. Moreover, the accuracy of predicting students who have worst result (class C) is higher in case of with test score than without score. Therefore, the test score along with prior academic achievement is well predictor for the academic success of engineering. Moreover, this test score is better predictor for the students who are more likely to do poorly. However in all the above cases there might be other factors that can influence the academic result (e.g. effort, motivation, study strategy, job demand, socio economic status, culture etc.) in addition with the score of the positioning test, mathematical experience, gender, and first year bachelor result. The classifiers are built based on the attributes that mainly contain the information about academic results. So in order to further improve the accuracy of the classifiers, attributes related to study strategy and technique can also be used.

208,Design And Development Of Sound Absorbing Panels Using  Biomass Materials,"manufacturing of sound-absorbing panels typically uses synthetic materials such as fiberglass and wool fibers. in this paper, biomass as acoustic absorbing materials were considered as an alternative to synthetic materials because it can provide a more economical perspective to the supply of sound-absorbing materials. in this study, three (3) fibrous materials were used as the main component of the sound-absorbing panels. these materials include coconut (cocos nucifera), corn (zea mays), and banana (musa balbisiana). moreover, this paper aims to manufacture sound-absorbing panels made from local biomass materials and determine its characteristic potential as acoustic sound absorbers using a custom-made impedance tube. to test the potential of the biomass materials as sound absorbers, its individual sound- absorbing coefficients were measured. in the impedance tube results, the data obtained from the biomass materials were compared to the data obtained from the conventional material. all the panels made from biomass materials were able to absorb sound significantly and level the characteristic qualities of sound absorbers made from conventional materials. therefore, improving the design of the impedance tube and fabrication of panels can increase the sound absorption coefficient of the manufactured materials.",,"was based on the interpretation of the solution that resulted from the computation of the formula that was used. In the computation using Pearson’s r formula for the sound absorption coefficient of coconut panel and frequency, the result of the r is 0.962110336. According to the study, the closer the result is to +1, the higher and stronger the relationship is between the two variables. The variables that were used in the computation were the frequency (variable x) and the sound absorption coefficients of the coconut panel (variable y). In the computation using Pearson's r formula for the sound absorption coefficient of the banana panel and frequency, the result of the r is 0.961053991. The variables that were used in the computation was the frequency (variable x) and the sound absorption coefficients of the coconut panel (variable y). Lastly, in the computation using the Pearson’s r formula for the sound absorption coefficient of corn panel and frequency, the result of the r is 0.952284335. The variables that were used in the computation was the frequency (variable x) and the sound absorption coefficients of the corn panel (variable y). It can be concluded that there is a very high positive relationship between the two variables: frequency and the sound absorption coefficients of the biomass materials. All the results fell into the 0.70 or higher range which is equivalent to a very high positive interpretation. This could mean that the relationship between the two variables is very significant. 4. Conclusion The researchers have manufactured sound-absorbing panels made from biomass materials. They have utilized three fibers and produced coconut husk fiber panel, corn husk fiber panel, and banana trunk fiber panel. The panels were made up of 1 kg of each fiber with a surface area of 0.3 m2, and a binding agent for the panel to stick together. Moreover, the panels were made up mostly of the fibers to ensure that no other factors will affect the performance of the acoustic panels. Based on the experiment, the sound-absorbing panels made from local biomass materials had significant performances in terms of its sound-absorbing properties. The manufactured panels were able to absorb sound and acquire necessary acoustical characteristics based on the application of the absorption coefficient. But compared to the measured sound absorption coefficient of the conventional material, the biomass materials were not able to surpass the characteristic qualities of sound absorbers made from conventional materials. Although the biomass materials do not surpass that of the conventional materials, this study is still useful considering that it can lessen the use of materials that cause pollution to the environment as well as materials that take large amounts of energy to process. Similarly, a custom-made impedance tube was assembled using ASTM and ISO standards as","peter gabriel c. buot, rayson m. cueto, andrei a. esguerra, ron irwin c. pascua and engr. sherwin s. magon school of mechanical and manufacturing engineering mapua university intramuros, manila, philippines ssmagon@mapua.edu.ph ma. janice j. gumasing school of industrial and engineering management mapua university intramuros, manila, philippines mjjgumasing@mapua.edu.ph","References

209,Performance Comparison And Indoor Air Quality Exposure  Assessment Of Fan-Powered Stove Versus Charcoal-Fueled,"the philippines still has struggled in energy distribution throughout the country that nearly 35% of filipino households still make use of charcoal as their fuel for cooking especially in rural areas. using the traditional way of cooking leads to some serious health problems as charcoal is not burned efficiently leading to produce harmful contaminants that affect the indoor air quality (iaq). this is the reason why chen et al. (2015) made a study about designing and fabricating three improved charcoal-fueled stoves that were efficient and produce lesser harmful contaminants than the traditional stove. these stoves have undergone testing to check their efficiency and performance by using the water boiling test (wbt) provided by the global alliance for clean cook stoves. for this reason, it became the research interest of the authors to design and fabricate a fan-powered stove and compare its iaq exposure and performance to the charcoal-fueled stove developed by chen et al. major contaminants which are carbon dioxide (co2), carbon monoxide (co), and particulate matter (pm), were recorded in the iaq assessment, while other iaq criteria, which are temperature, relative humidity, fuel consumption, firepower and thermal efficiency were also measured and evaluated in the study. based on the results of the water boiling test, the fan-powered stove developed by the researchers was much better than the charcoal-fueled stove in terms of performance except on the firepower. furthermore, the fan-powered stove was efficient enough to lower the parameters within standards except for the particulate matter (pm).","indoor air quality, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, particulate matter","The water boiling test results of the fan powered cook stove were much higher than the study of Chen et al. (2015) due to better design and fabrication of the stove. In terms of stove performance, the charcoal-fueled cookstove had less time to boil, lower specific fuel consumption, higher thermal efficiency, high turn-down ratio but lower firepower compared to the results of the previous study. Based on the results of the IAQ assessment, it can be concluded that improving the design of the cookstove can lower the contaminants emitted. However, stove design improvement alone is not enough to lower the contaminants within standards. It was observed that cooking using charcoal-fueled cookstoves slightly affected the temperature and relative humidity at the breathing zone. However, the results obtained for the indoor temperature and relative humidity were not within standards which may be due to the heat from cooking.

210,Installation Of Pico-Hydro System To Augment The  Electricity Requirement Of A Rural Community In Victoria,"this study focuses on the design, fabrication, and installation of a pico-hydro system in a rural community down south of oriental mindoro. the researchers were inspired by the fact that there are still many filipinos that are deprived of having electricity, these were the people from remotes areas. pico-hydro system is not new to us anymore, but it can give help and provide free electricity to others if there is an abundant source of water in the area and available head good enough to produce electricity. the department of energy (doe) manual was used as a reference for selecting the place for the study and for the methods in measuring the important parameters in the construction of the system. major parts of the pico-hydro were fabricated using the available materials from calapan and victoria, oriental mindoro. the researchers were able to produce a maximum output power of 211.5w with a water flow rate of 74.39 l/s and an effective head of 2 meters. the produced output was lower than what the researchers had expected but is enough for the consumption of a small community.","pico-hydro system, rural community","The pico-hydroelectric system was built in order to serve as a source of electricity for a small community in Sitio Palayang Bayan, Barangay Villa Cerveza Victoria, Oriental Mindoro. The design and fabrication of the system followed the parameters attained in the site which were 2.2-meter head and 74.3954 L/s water flow rate. Material that was needed to build the system was bought from the city not in Manila in order to lessen the expenses and avoid damages while transporting. The system was designed to generate power using a 3kVA generator. The maximum output that the system could generate is 211.5 watts while having a load of 23 watts and the generator is at 1930 rpm. In order to distribute the generated power, 10 makeshift electrical post and 300-meter-long electrical wires with a diameter of 1.25 sq.mm, and having a 12A rating was used. There is a circuit breaker to serve as a safety device in case of an emergency. A 2SM type of battery was used as a continuous power bank and energy reservoir in order to store the excess power generated when the electrical consumption was at a minimum. This is also to prevent the generator to have excessive rpm. The power bank is composed of a used battery charger, battery, and 300W inverter. The test result shows that the circuit containing the battery and the connected load was able to regulate the rpm but causing the power output to drop to 187 watts. The said output was observed to be enough for all the connected households since all they need was a light source during the night.","oriental mindoro, philippines jupete n. diswe, kent andrew c. dudas, arvin jan a. padilla, reimbert randall a. roca and engr. igmedio f. isla, jr. school of mechanical and manufacturing engineering mapua university intramuros, manila, philippines ifisla@mapua.edu.ph ma. janice j. gumasing school of industrial engineering and engineering management mapua university intramuros, manila, philippines mjjgumasing@mapua.edu.ph",
211,Development Of Portable Chiller For Carabao Milk With  Independent Cooling System Using Thermoelectric Effect,"carabao milk is particlarly known for having short shelf life if not refrigerated immediately after collection. the farmers in the vicinity of the philippine carabao center address this problem by using ice and water to keep the freshly harvested milk refrigerated. this project was devised to find another way to travel the freshly harvested milk. to be able to refrigerate the container, thermoelectric coolers were used. these devices are compact and small in size but are capable of cooling reaching temperatures of up to below freezing temperatures. it develops a temperature difference as electricity passes through it, one side is cold, and the other is hot. the heat given off on the hot side needs to be rejected to be able to further decrease the temperature on the cold side. in this study, the researchers fabricated a container that was used as a cooling container for carabao milk. the main material used in the container was stainless-steel 304, and for the thermoelectric cooler, the researchers used a thermoelectric cooler that was available in the market with a power rating of 12v and 6a. for the heatsink and fan assembly, a thermal paste was used to integrate the thermoelectric cooler to the assembly to increase the heat transfer between the cold side and the container as well as the hot side and the heatsink. the cooling system was powered by two lead-acid battery and the battery was charged using a solar panel. the study was successful in preserving the quality of the carabao milk-based on physico-chemical analysis done by philippine carabao center (pccp), however, it did not reach the desired temperature which was 4℃ due to several factors namely; fabrication of the flat side, battery power rating, insufficient number of the thermoelectric module used, and heat loss in the system.","carabao milk, portable chiller","This study was done to explore the range of thermoelectric technology applications. It was utilized as a cooling device for milk containers which deviates from conventional vapor-compression systems that require refrigerant in heat transfer. This study on thermoelectric cooler will help future researchers to assess its capacity and ability to reject heat. The main purpose of this study was to provide an alternative way of preserving the quality of carabao milk harvested by farmers. At present, they usually use large ice chests filled with a mixture of water and ice to lower its temperature until it arrives at the receiving facility. The receiving facility utilizes communal freezers to drastically reduce the milk temperature up to its safe storage limit. This prototype was a viable option for the farmers since it offers higher cooling capacity and lightweight characteristics compared to the ice chests they use in the transportation of milk from one place to another. This study has three objectives. The researchers were not able to meet the first objective which was to maintain the temperature of the milk for 2℃-4℃. This was mainly due to the existence of a thermal bridge in the system, time constraints of each test, and thermal contact of the thermoelectric module. The produced graph of cooling was a representation of an exponential function that estimates a total time of 7 hours before 4C can be attained. The second objective was met based on the physicochemical analysis from PCC which confirms that milk cooled using the portable container did not spoil after 2 hours of testing under actual environmental conditions. The last objective was to charge the battery using a solar panel. The researchers decided to use a 50W solar panel which could fully charge each battery for six hours. Based on the data given by PCC, it would take no more than one-hour travel time to reach the manufacturing plant even from the farthest cooperative. This enables farmers to charge the battery early right after its use to compensate for its long charging time. The fabrication process of the container is still not ideal for milk storage since cornered surfaces although not at 90- degree angles still exist. The fabricated container contains corners with two surfaces having more than 90-degree intersection angles. This is due to part by part fabrication and lack of equipment utilized in fabricating the design. The flat side part of the container was also fabricated manually which leads to an unsmooth surface finish. A recommendation for improving the fabrication process of the container is to have it machined to have a smooth surface finish. The consequence however is the additional cost of fabrication. Lead-acid batteries used in the container are heavier than other types of batteries present in the market. It is used most of its flexibility in having huge power capacity that is not currently present in lighter batteries like lithium-ion. Future researchers are advised to consider using lighter batteries if improved power source that is available in the market. In addition, a higher battery rating is also highly recommended if the future researchers decided to increase the number of thermoelectric coolers to improve the cooling capacity.","christian henry d. escolar, adrian michael n. lee, ian m. matibag and mark christian e. manuel, phd. school of mechanical and manufacturing engineering mapua university intramuros, manila, philippines mcemanuel@mapua.edu.ph ma. janice j. gumasing school of industrial engineering and engineering management mapua university intramuros, manila, philippines mjjgumasing@mapua.edu.ph",
212,Ergonomic Design Of Tunnel Ventilation System For  Underground Mrt Station Using Cfd Simulation,"ventilation is considered as one of the engineering controls to remove or control contaminants released in indoor work environments. it is one of the preferred ways to control human exposure to air contaminants. it is commonly used to remove contaminants such as fumes, dust, and vapors; and to provide a healthy and safe environment. industrial systems are designed to move out and bring in a specific amount of air at a specific speed, which results in the removal of undesirable contaminants. while all ventilation systems follow the same basic principles, each system is designed specifically to match the type of work and the rate of contaminant release in that area (ccohs, 2020). one of the types of the industrial ventilation system is a tunnel ventilation system. tunnel ventilation system (tvs) is an essential part of maintaining a safe environment inside the tunnel during congestion and emergency operation. during the congestion scenario, tvs will operate to maintain the design temperature inside the tunnel. during the fire mode scenario, tvs will automatically operate via push-pull ventilation to control smoke direction away from the people to provide a safe escape pathway. it was also validated from the computational fluid dynamics (cfd) analysis that the result of subway environmental simulation (ses) airflow capacity for congestion and fire mode scenarios are sufficient throughout the tunnel. cfd analysis using fire dynamic simulator (fds). fds is the software used for analyzing smoke behavior in terms of airflow, temperature, relative humidity, velocity, and soot visibility. as part of the simulation result, the researchers were able to see the results on every part of the tunnel. one of the major advantages of cfd simulation is that the researchers can do trial and error on every possible scenario and location of the fire heat load to best analyze the situation in the worst-case scenario. time is also an essential factor during fire mode, and the cfd simulation can be used as a basis for the emergency response team for a proper fire escape plan.",cfd simulation,"From the SES result during congestion scenarios, the Push-Pull ventilation operational strategy shows the effectivity of maintaining the tunnel temperature at 37.36 deg. C below as indicated on the design criteria of 45 deg. C. With direct airflow towards the incident train within the tunnel, with one (1) TVF unit is for supply air from Station east end and one (1) TVF unit for exhaust air from Station west end. These results are verified via Pyrosim CFD analysis, using the airflow capacity of the TVF developed on the SES result, the tunnel temperature has the result of 36.7 °C to 37.4 °C. With the temperature of the tunnel not exceeding the design criteria, the push-pull ventilation strategy is the proper way of ventilation for the underground tunnel.

213,Development Of Molding Machine For Petal-Shape   Gum Paste,"this study focuses on the design and development of a molding machine that can be used in the process of making edible gum paste petals for export-quality cake decorations of a certain company situated in the philippines. during the period of the study, the company employs manual labor in their production process. the processes of making these cake decorations (rose gum paste) include kneading/sheeting of sugar gum paste followed by manual cutting of petals or herbs, then manual thinning, and forming the cut petal tips, and finally, manual joining or sticking of petals to form a rose decoration. the researchers were able to develop a molding machine with the application of computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (cad/cam) and pneumatics technology to speed up the company's cutting, thinning, and forming processes of rose gum paste. sheets of gum paste were used to evaluate the performance of the molding machine.","molding machine, gum paste, protein","The researchers were able to develop a molding machine for petal shape gum paste with the use of CAD/CAM and Fluidsim software. The molding machine was fabricated based on the final design and its components were selected based on design calculation, availability, and costs. Also, the trial shows that the molding machine was able to meet the desire functions to produce 3D molded gum paste of rose petal in shape. Manual cutting of the existing process was eliminated and the process was improved, but the operator risk of being lacerated was eliminated also. Since the production capacity can be increased by 58.72% or 4,397 roses/month, therefore, the company’s cutting, thinning, and forming processes for rose gum paste can be improved with the use of the molding machine. With a monthly net income difference of Php 9,469.43, the investment can be recovered based on a payback period of 6 months, therefore, the project is feasible and good to invest in.

214,Battery Size Optimization Strategies For The  Solar Powered Led Lights,"light emitting diodes (leds) are recently preferred for the implementations of low-energy consumption illumination systems because of their non-thermal light production effect. solar rechargeable batteries can be used to power light emitting diodes lights (led-lights), but their costs increase with their charge storage capacity. electric lights are often required to operate for a period that do not exceed 24 hours and are only mainly necessary to operate whenever there is a nearby person. in this study, a microcontroller that is interfaced with the light dependent resistor (ldr) and a passive infra-red sensor (pir) will detect the presence of moving bodies and darkness to switch on led lights for a predetermined period. the microcontroller code and hardware has been designed to optimize energy consumption by enabling low microcontroller clocking frequency and sleep mode features. a data acquisition system (das) has been used to assist with the evaluation of a solar site in question. the use of ldr, pir, a das, low clocking frequencies and sleep mode feature of the microcontroller has made it feasible to use less capacity solar rechargeable battery for the supply of led lighting system over longer periods.","led lights, battery, microcontroller","From the results that were obtained in this study, it is clear that the operational time of a battery used to power LED lights was optimized by: • A careful study of the location’s solar insulation profile. • Incorporating PIR and Day- night switches to detect the necessity to switch on lights • a use of microcontroller to control the LED lights switching activities. • Lowering the clock frequency of the microcontroller whilst utilizing sleep feature. Considering all this factors will benefit the designers to use smallest and cheapest battery for their illumination tasks.

215,Embedded Data Acquisition Systems For The Logging And  Monitoring Of Pv Parameters,"data acquisition systems (das) have already been used to acquire signals that range from medical, renewable energy, audio, etc. photovoltaic pv) produced energy signals regularly vary with the amount of received solar irradiance and environmental factors such as the solar panel temperatures. users with the interest of knowing the degree of pv output energy variations often use online solar maps and climatic records to build and evaluate solar profiles. this research proposes to take advantage of the dropping prices and high performance of microcontrollers to build aa das that will be used to monitor and logs pv produced power together with surrounding temperature values. the microcontroller circuit is interfaced to a voltage /current detector, temperature sensor and an optional battery detection circuit. the logging aspect will also enable solar profiling of received solar irradiance and pv panel temperatures, which will then reduce the reliance upon solar maps and climatic data that are not always free. by using a das, users will be able to monitor and build their custom solar profiles based on received solar irradiance together with temperature information. the stored records or live information will be useful in the maintenance or upgrades of photovoltaic energy systems.","photovoltaic, logging","Real-time solar power and roof temperatures were successfully acquired by microcontroller based DAS, which was interfaced to appropriate sensors as described. By using proper formulas, it will be therefore possible to record accurate values that will be thereafter used to profile the performance of a photovoltaic system. Having profile may remove the necessity of solar maps for the design of future solar system within the same location. A simple 12-volt battery detection may also be implemented by using LM7809 fixed voltage regulator.","nkateko e. mabunda department of electrical and electronicsengineering technnlogy university of johannesburg, south africa nkatekom@uj.ac.za",

217,Human Factors Influence In Information Systems Security:  Towards A Conceptual Framework,"the importance of protecting information in banks and mitigating security breach is becoming more important than ever. human factors represent essential issues in information systems security in organizations, since human factors determine the behavior of employees toward information systems security. extant literature revealed that the human factor aspect is one of the emerging research areas in information security. thus, this research tries to explore information systems security countermeasures that are used to reduce internal threat and how employees perceive them and create a human factors model to address human factor gaps in information systems security in commercial banks in ethiopia. accordingly, a conceptual human factor model is developed from literature. a qualitative case study research design is employed to validate the proposed conceptual framework in selected banks in ethiopia. purposive sampling is employed to select the sampled banks. the samples are selected based on eligibility criteria that the respondents should have experience and expertise in information systems security and the banking activities. the research contributes to the current knowledge of information security by demonstrating the importance and critical role of human factors in the development of an information systems security model. the main contribution would be the advancement of the theoretical and practical basis for information systems security in proposing a model framework for developing, assessing and modeling a human factor model. furthermore, it improves the understanding of risks in the security incident stages in relation to human factors.",human behavior,"and Way Forward The main reason of writing the literature review is to present theoretical basis as an input for the research. This chapter consists of two main parts. The first part is a theoretical literature and the second part is literature about related work. It is assumed that 50 - 70 % of overall information systems security incidents in organizations result from the employees’ misuse that is ranging from naïve mistakes to an intentional harm (Siponen & Vance 2010). Therefore, improving the information systems security needs both investments in the technical, social and organizational resources (Bulgurcu et al. 2010). Therefore, recent studies need to be shifted the focus to organizational, environmental, and individual factors that influence employees’ behavior, as they are regarded as the weakest link in information systems security (Siponen 2010, Bulgurcu et al. 2010). The prior researchers have found that increasing employees’ information systems awareness has a strong positive effect on their information systems policy compliant behavior (Bulgurcu et al. 2010). This research is, therefore, designed to investigate the literature relating mainly to policy, culture and training to information systems security. There is a need to address issues relating to policy, culture and training in order to design information systems security model for commercial banks in Ethiopia. The reviewed literature includes some very recent studies conducted in 2019 and some studies conducted in not more than ten years. From the literature, it is found that the relationship between policy, culture and awareness to information systems security has been examined and investigated by different scholars in different contexts. Furthermore, this relationship is articulated in a model created by the researchers (Figure 1). The research contributes to the current knowledge of information security by demonstrating the importance and critical role of human factors in the development of an information systems security model. The main contribution would be the advancement of the theoretical and practical basis for information systems security in proposing a model framework for developing, assessing and modeling a human factor model. Furthermore, it improves the understanding of risks in the security incident stages in relation to human factors. The research examines the role of human factors in information systems security processes. The findings emphasize the importance of human factors in today’s information security context and provide guidance on addressing the risk to and return on security investments. This could perhaps serve to improve the commercial banks performance, competitiveness and effectiveness of their security policies and guidelines. This research can also benefit the government and National Bank of Ethiopia in their effort and mission to make policy for commercial banks since they are policy makers and regulatory agents to maintain healthy economy. Furthermore, managers or decision makers in banks can be benefited from the outcome of this research by understanding the employees’ behaviour that can affect information systems security to improve data security. Also practitioners can use the knowledge developed in this research for training and education.

222,The Potential Of Iot On The Education Sector In Zimbabwe:  The Case Of University Of Zimbabwe,"the internet of things (iot) is a technological trend or development that is changing the world in several amazing ways. it is a technological trend or development that developing countries such as zimbabwe can adopt to jumpstart their economies so as to improve the welfare of their populations. this technological trend has expeditiously captivated the global attention with business organisations, academia and governments assigning high priority to them. reviewed literature shows that most developed economies have embraced and implemented iot technologies in tertiary education institutions resulting in the improvement of the learning experience and management of resources, an opposite characteristic of developing economies such as zimbabwe which still lag behind with regards to technological stature of institutions of higher learning. the focus of this paper is to explore the potential that iot holds for the tertiary education sector in zimbabwe. the study develops a framework to harness the power of iot in zimbabwe’s education sector that institutions of higher learning can adopt in their quest to drive the nation’s socio economic development. this is achieved through the exploration of a case study (university of zimbabwe) on the feasibility, possible adoption options and how this enhances the return on the ict investments already made on the existing ict infrastructure. the case study analysis process undertaken sheds more light on both positive and negative factors that require consideration when iot is set to be implemented in the education sector. a framework for the adoption was developed and recommendations rendered.",,"AND RECOMMENDATIONS Technological advancement is creating vast opportunities that developing countries can take advantage of in order to bridge the gap of development with their counter parts in the first world. These opportunities, when fully utilised, empower business organisations and individuals to leverage ICT investments they make thereby harnessing fully the power embedded in ICTs. This study presents an opportunity that institution of higher learning in Zimbabwe and beyond can take advantage of and become more efficient and effective in their quest to deliver higher quality education.","farai francisco madyira university of zimbabwe school of technology university of zimbabwe harare, zimbabwe madyiraff@gmail.com, fmadyira@uz.edu.zw barend w botha university of johannesburg johannesburg, south africa bwbotha@uj.ac.za",
223,"Magnetic Survey For Qualitative Interpretation Of  Subsurface Andesites Rocks Distribution In Kutasari,","a magnetic survey has been carried out in kutasari district, purbalingga regency, central java, indonesia in april 2019. the aim of this research is to interpret the distribution of subsurface andesite rocks qualitatively in the research area. the equipment used in this research are proton precession magnetometer, global positioning system, compass, and other supporting tools. the final result is the local magnetic anomaly map with value of -1,238.13 – 1,892.40 nt. this local magnetic anomaly map show the anomalous sources distribution in the subsurface which is interpreted as andesite igneous rocks that dominate in the middle to northwestern of the research area. this result has been clarified by pseudogravity anomaly map and analysis of its horizontal gradient. the pseudogravity anomaly map which has value of -75.99 – 119.50 mgal represents the distribution of subsurface rocks density. whereas the horizontal gradient map which has value of 0.0022 – 0.3305 mgal/m represents the subsurface rocks lithological boundaries. both of them shows the distribution of subsurface anomalous sources which is interpreted as andesite rocks tends to be western of the research area.","magnetic survey, andesite rocks","Magnetic survey with magnetic method for qualitative interpretation of andesite igneous rocks distribution in the subsurface has been done in Kutasari District, Purbalingga Regency, Central Java, Indonesia in April 2019. The research area is the lower southern slope of Slamet Volcano, Central Java. Geologically, the dominant rocks in the research area surface are andesite rocks. The local magnetic anomaly map that represent distribution of subsurface anomalous sources has values ranging of -1,238.13 – 1,892.40 nT. This value interval which relatively very large is associated to the magnetic susceptibility quantity of the subsurface magnetic object which interpreted as andesites igneous rocks. These rocks have dominate in the western to northwest of the research area. This fact is reinforced by pseudogravity anomaly and it′s horizontal gradient maps. The pseudogravity anomaly map represents distribution of subsurface rocks density, where almost all over igneous rocks including andesites have high density. Whereas the horizontal gradient contour map represents the lithological contact boundaries of subsurface rocks. Both of them show that the subsurface anomalous sources distribution interpreted as andesite igneous rocks are in the western of the research area.","purbalingga regency, indonesia sehah, sukmaji anom raharjo, urip nurwijayanto prabowo, and dwi setiawan sutanto department of physics, faculty of mathematics and natural sciences, universitas jenderal soedirman, purwokerto, indonesia sehah@unsoed.ac.id, raharjoajie@gmail.com, urip.nurwijayanto@gmail.com dwisetiawansutanto97sarjo@gmail.com abdul talib bon department of production and operations, university tun hussein onn malaysia, malaysia talibon@gmail.com",
224,Blockchain-Secured Health Wearables In Smart Homes  Utilising Raspberry Pi Web Of Things Gateways,"owing to the large-scale public health crisis arising from the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19), the global health system could not adequately deal with the entirety of infections. consequently, improvisations meant to complement the healthcare systems in remedying the pandemic emerged. “hospital-at-home” improvisations include the use of wearable technology to triage patients within households before consulting the health institutions. the wearable devices collect physiological and activity data in order to detect or predict the prevalence of the disease. unfortunately, do-it-yourself health improvisations expose citizens to security vulnerabilities and interoperability challenges. this study proposes the adaptation of a prototype developed prior to the pandemic in securing smart homes and to interoperate health wearable devices used in detecting the prevalence of covid-19 before symptoms manifest. focus is placed on: 1) integration of wearables from different vendors to ensure interoperability using the mozilla webthings gateway on raspberry pi; 2) use of hyperledger fabric blockchain to secure the data and allow for implementation of legal restrictions through software. the proposed user-centric wearables architecture enhances data privacy through edge and fog computing, whilst opening up smart homes to general data and protection regulations (gdpr)-inspired “data portability” and personal data monetization opportunities.","wearables, covid-19, web of things, blockchain",,solomon hopewell kembo department of computer engineering university of zimbabwe solomonkembo@gmail.com patience mpofu department of computer engineering university of zimbabwe mampopatie@gmail.com brighton tafadzwa mukorera cryptosine pbc bmukorera@gmail.com saulo jacques hacking ecology saulo@hackingecology.com,"References

225,Utilizing A Privacy-Preserving Iot Edge And Fog  Architecture In Automated Household Aquaponics.,"global pandemics significantly disrupt local food supply chains as was evident at the peak of the corona virus disease 2019 (covid-19). covid-19 lockdowns adversely affected food security among mostly the poor and vulnerable. limited interactions among farmers, inputs providers, food processors, transporters, and retailers negatively affected the provision of food. to cab food shortages, implementing the internet of things (iot) based household aquaponics in order to ensure sustainable food production, is a potentially viable solution. ordinarily, poor and vulnerable households are digitally illiterate. privacy concerns adversely influence the adoption of iot-based automation. consequently, guaranteeing security by default among the digitally illiterate becomes necessary to improve iot adoption. a potential solution is utilizing an architecture that ensures “privacy by design” in addressing iot privacy concerns. we propose an “offline-first” architecture for automated and low-cost household aquaponics units. the privacy-preserving architecture moves machine learning, data storage, and computation away from cloud platforms into privacy-preserving, community-hosted fog and edge computing platforms.","raspberry pi, cloud computing, fog computing","The present project demonstrates the feasibility and the strong security in an IoT architecture that prioritizes processing within the edge and fog networks. Security guarantees within IoT applications will enhance adoption of the technology. It also demonstrates the possibility of implementing IoT-driven Aquaponics within households, making communities food self-sufficient. Machine learning model implemented at a local level improves efficiency and frees user from relying on internet connectivity for all processes. Although researches in edge and fog computing focused on aquaculture is still new, the results show that the adoption of mature, robust platforms for edge-enabled services, rather than customized implementations, will help address this area to grow. Expensive internet access in Zimbabwe and Africa is still a problem, and the use of edge and fog computing will help to overcome the problems related to inadequate internet. It also can ensure digital sovereignty and play a key role to meet the global challenge posed by food insecurity.

226,"Synthesising Lean Construction And Building Information  Modelling To Improve The South African Architecture,","the south african architecture, engineering and the construction (aec) industry falls victim to fragmentation of processes and lack of coordination amongst professionals. therefore an urgent need to explore and embrace techniques, technologies and innovations reduces building cost, materials and time, while collaboration amongst professionals is enhanced. building information modelling has shown promise to solve some of the problems associated with building design’s ineffectiveness and facilitates a more collaborative approach to project delivery. while lean construction can reduce waste and non-value added activities in a process. however, it is unclear how the two concepts straddled together can further improve efficiency in construction. therefore, it is critical to determine the barriers and opportunities of combined systems. various sources of literature reveal that several barriers affect the synergy between lean construction and building information modelling. this research uses a comprehensive literature review to gather data for analysis. furthermore, the authors use their autoethnographic experience to synthesise factors contributing to the systems’ successes and failures in south africa. finally, a framework of strategies to synthesise lean construction and building information is created. this research will be necessary for researchers, practitioners, and other professionals to add to the body of knowledge in construction and information technology.","lean construction, aec, construction",,"construction and engineering industries temitope olaniran department of architecture faculty of engineering and the built environment durban university of technology durban, 4001, republic of south africa temitopeo@dut.ac.za nischolan pillay department of architecture faculty of engineering and the built environment durban university of technology durban, 4001, republic of south africa nischolanp@dut.ac.za",
227,Android-Based Information Technology Design   For Easy Parking,"the development of transportation information technology has been going on for a long time. the development of information technology has forced every individual to master it. including the development of parking information technology. limited parking spaces at public service locations have become a problem for the community. integrated parking information technology using mobile communication devices, laptops and personal computers is needed. the problem faced now is to be able to ensure a parking space is available. this study aims to answer these problems. the methodology used is to create an android-based parking information technology application. with the hope that the convenience of this parking application will make certainty about the place and time of parking users.","transportation, parking","As has been discussed in early chapter, the availability of parking space has become one of major issue within transportation management systems. Many researches have been conducted in regard of solving the problems. However, a unique model was required for specific problem solver within transportation issue. This parking management system was constructed to challenge the problem faced within train station parking facilities. The use of IoT bring the development of such systems to the next level and it was proved which could facilitate the uniqueness of the required program. The program is open for the further explorations and ready to be implemented for permanent basis. Furthermore, its employment hopefully will bring advantages for the future regulator and for sure, will make the parking user satisfied.

228,Improvement Of Mathematical Communication Skills And  Learning Independence Students Who Get Quantum,"mathematical communication is one of the abilities that students need to have to understand mathematics meaningfully. however, the reality is that there are still many students who have low mathematical communication skills. therefore, it is necessary to apply specific learning models to increase these abilities. this study aimed to analyze the quality of the improvement in mathematical communication skills of students who received the quantum teaching model. this research is a quasi-experimental research with data collection techniques using quantitative analysis obtained from the pretest and post-test results. the study population was all seventh-grade students at one junior high school in garut with a sample of two classes. the instrument used in this study was a test in the form of questions to measure mathematical communication skills. the results showed the quality of the increase in students' mathematical communication skills who got the moderate interpretation quantum teaching model.",,"is that there is no difference in the improvement of mathematical communication skills between students who get the Quantum Teaching model and the conventional learning. The results of the previous data analysis, namely the increase in mathematical communication skills between students who received the Quantum Teaching model with conventional learning models did not show any significant differences, and when viewed from the average calculation of the increase in the two groups showed the same results, namely moderate interpretation. In general, students who get the Quantum Teaching model tend to be confused when working on Student Worksheets because, in this model, students are expected to be able to bring their own experiences to fill in the steps on the Student Worksheets so that they find a concept. The Quantum Teaching model with the (TANDUR) syntax Grow, Natural, Name, Demonstrate, Repeat, and Celebrate. It turned out that after the application of this approach, some students did not like the repetitive syntax. But in general, quantum teaching learning model can improve students' mathematical communication skills. This is consistent with the results of research from Rumapea, G, etc (2017) that there is an increase student learning outcomes in study algebraic operations by using quantum teaching learning model. This has implications for the 1st and 2nd indicators of mathematical communication skills, namely explaining ideas, situations, and mathematical relationships orally or writing with real objects, pictures, graphics, and algebra, and states everyday events in language or symbols. The increase in mathematical communication skills on indicators 1 and 2 exceeded half of the number of students showing moderate interpretation. So it can be said that some students have not been able to explain ideas, situations and mathematical relations orally or in writing with real objects, pictures, graphics, and algebra; and express everyday events in language or symbols even though they have got the Quantum Teaching model. Another case for the 3rd indicator, students can make conjectures, compile arguments, formulate definitions, and generalizations. In the Quantum Teaching class, some students are able to define or draw conclusions from a problem. It can be seen from the interpretation of the improvement for this 3rd indicator is high. Similar to conventional learning classes, some students can define or conclude a problem.

229,Identifying Factors That Contribute To Poor Performance Of  Junior Coal Miners In South Africa,"the junior coal companies in south africa are facing a number of challenges which have contributed to poor performance, resulting in some of them having to close down. the sa government developed a mining charter which encourages 26% black ownership (broad based black-economic empowerment) in mining companies, which aims to support junior miners. in addition, eskom has also developed a policy that enforces that 40% supply of thermal coal must come from junior miners. as a result, richards bay coal terminal in conjunction with transnet increased its capacity to boost junior coal miners. despite this support that junior coal miners are getting, they still face operational challenges which range from finance, transportation, production, and lack of skilled personnel. this has caused a number of junior miners to shut down their operations as the taxes, royalty fees and community investments continue to be a burden. data was collected using questionnaires as well as personal interviews. the study revealed that the most common challenge for the junior miners is lack of capital and financial support. the lack of finance has led to junior miners not being able to afford relevant industry skilled personnel.","productivity, production, zimbabwe, december 7-10","The aim of this study was to identify the factors that contribute to poor performance of junior coal miners in South Africa. The questionnaires and interviews were sent to 120 respondents of which 85 participated, which is about 71% response rate. The miners were asked basic questions in a questionnaire, and more information was extracted during the interviews. The study revealed that the most common challenge for the junior miners is lack of capital and financial support. Though they received contracts from the likes of Eskom and Sasol, the money made from these contracts goes into bank repayments, contractors, consultants and transportation. This results in junior coal mines being unable to sustain their business which leads to poor performance and subsequently shut down. Government intervention is needed in a form of providing capital for purchasing equipment and funding for the miners to be able to pay salaries for the first few years. This will assist the miners to sustain the business as they will not have to borrow money from the banks.

230,Geospatial Dashboards For Mapping And Tracking Of Novel  Coronavirus Pandemic,"in mid of december 2019, wuhan sea food, china a new mysterious illness was reported lately called coronavirus (covid-19, the virus triggered a severe respiratory disease, rapidly speeded to many other states of china and around the world. covid-19 is a new strain that had not been previously identified in humans. hundreds of millions of people have been placed in some form of isolation. governments announcing country wide lockdown while declaring the emergency to fight the sharp rise in coronavirus infection. the epidemic’s consequences are devastating, currently around the globe more than three million confirm cases reported. unfortunately, we are still counting the days, the cases and, most sadly of all, the deadly virus has taken more than three hundred thousand lives. the wealth health organization (who) officially has called covid-19 a pandemic. the previous viruses sars-cov, avian influenza, mers-cov and the ebola, emerged the geographic information system , remote sensing applications , mapping and tracking techniques and social media platforms were provided an indispensable support for appropriate, accurate and timely response in the epidemic outbreak. the aim of the research is to critical review the development of geospatial dashboards which are using in real time monitoring and providing decision support in terms of visualization and integration of mapping in covid-19 pandemic. this paper presents a comparison of covid-19 geospatial dashboards and key technologies and applications use to fight with deadly virus.","coronavirus, remote sensing, who","The innovative Spatial technologies, web-based tools, monitoring and providing a real time data, tracking, and mapping with improved data are playing a vital role in critical decision making (Abid et al., 2020). Increasing disaster resilience involves a focus on the strength and sustainability of a community’s lifelines, as well as strengthening the relations between people, services, systems, and structures that support the community to function (Sulaiman et al., 2019). Mapping dashboards as discussed above giving live and update information have been extremely popular in sharing and understanding the spread of coronavirus. In the situation of lockdown these dashboards giving accurate data from all over the world in a single web address. Interaction through online map- based dashboards offers friendly information to people around the world eager to protect themselves and their families. These dashboards enhance data transparency and helps government authorities disseminate information. The dashboard depicts the future trends and providing a timely information to fight this pandemic. Certainly, the dashboards are providing indispensable support and creating awareness in panic condition. These are the powerful tools providing a new capability to under crisis situation, not only for Covid-19, but the mapping dashboards techniques are also familiar even to young children who have become accustomed to the Google Map and similar services. We must believe that how Covid -19 mapping dashboards can support the entire process of deadly disease outbreak.

231,Need For Resilience Healthcare Facilities Management  (Rhfm) In Malaysia’S Public Hospitals.,"in malaysia, over the year’s disasters has affected buildings and infrastructure including healthcare facilities severely. the past events should provide a valuable lesson for future preparedness and planning in healthcare facilities whether from natural, man-made or both disasters. however, recent hospital disaster shows that more in-depth effort should be emphasized in hospitals of malaysia. therefore, to ensure that hospitals and health facilities can withstand emergencies and disasters, resilience strategies has been examined to highlight the importance of assessing risks and preparing for them. in this study, a different toolkits of health care facility management were identified. the research is based on published literature review and past research to achieve the objective. through the identification and integration of the factors and resilience healthcare facilities management (rhfm) toolkit was identified to highlight the health care management in the hospital public sector. the toolkit contributes significantly to resilience healthcare facilities management process. these findings not only give benefit to the people involved in the hospital industry but also to the public officials in guiding them to be more accountable in handling risks, emergencies, disasters, and resilience strategies process.","disaster resilience, healthcare, resilience toolkit",,"a critical literature review noralfishah sulaiman, sheikh kamran abid, umber nazir, nur putri najwa mahmud, siti kursiah kamalia abdul latib, haridzah fathini muhammad hafidz kanzu research: resilient built environment (rbe), faculty of technology management & business, universiti tun hussein onn malaysia (uthm), 86400, johor, malaysia. nora@uthm.edu.my , shkamranabid@gmail.com , ambernazir4@gmail.com , putrinajwa785@gmail.com , lialatib@gmail.com , haridzahfathini2008@gmail.com , ahmed farhan roslan construction research institute of malaysia (cream) ahmadfarhanroslan@gmail.com norbaya ab rahim department of estate management, faculty of architecture, planning & surveying, universiti of teknologi mara (uitm) norba708@uitm.edu.my",
232,Predict 2020 Usa Presidential Election Covid-19  Correlation,"this project investigates different strategies trump can utilize in reopening states during the covid-19 pandemic. during the pandemic, the president and state governors face the challenge of deciding when to reopen the states and whether they should all be opened all at once or based on their individual situations. based on several calculated variables, such as past win margins of swing states, infected cases, deaths, and unemployment increases for 16 different swing states from past elections, the authors draw conclusions on which states president trump should be put into consideration to “liberate” or “reopen” to not only safely reopen, but to maximize his chances of winning the 2020 election. with the calculated and collected variables, a statistical model is created to aid in decision making. although the safest option is to stay closed, many state economies and the overall national economy suffer due to the closure. trump’s pro-economy campaign must wisely select which states to liberate based not only on unemployment rates, but chances of winning that state in the upcoming 2020 election. this project plays special attention to michigan, minnesota, and virginia, which were called out in president trump’s tweet on april 17, 2020. ultimately, this project concludes that minnesota is a safe state to liberate, michigan is too risky, and virginia can be liberated, but the authors advise against it. additionally, two possible scenarios are also covered in this paper. this project demonstrates a practical and statistical modeling framework considering social and political science factors.",covid-19,"In conclusion, the authors would not suggest President Trump to liberate Michigan and Virginia because Michigan is way too risky with high infection and death rates, and if liberated the risk of spreading COVID is too high and dangerous. Virginia is hard to decide since the pros and cons are too similar and it is best left not liberated. It is not worth the risk opening just for business when unemployment rates are not a big problem in Virginia. However, President Trump could potentially liberate Minnesota, since the risk of spreading COVID is not high and there is a huge benefit for businesses and people when reducing the unemployment rate. Furthermore, President Trump could liberate Ohio, Georgia, North Carolina, Wisconsin, and New Hampshire if necessary in attempts to sway them to his side since the risk of COVID is relatively low and they could benefit from businesses reopening. There are two possible scenarios the authors thought out. In Scenario One if President Trump doesn’t push any states to liberate, he will win the 2020 election, because even though he loses 36 votes from Michigan (liberate index of 33.54) and Pennsylvania (liberate index of 1.39), he gets four more from New Hampshire (liberate index of -7.20) and Proceedings of the 2nd African International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management Harare, Zimbabwe, December 7-10, 2020","saloni patel stanford online high school, redwood city, ca 94063 saloni05@ohs.stanford.edu mason chen stanford online high school, redwood city, ca 94063 mason05@ohs.stanford.edu patrick giuliano abbott structural heart, menlo park, ca 94025 patrick.giuliano@gmail.com","References

233,"Exploring Emotions And Correlations To Time, And  Teenagers With Brain Computer Interfaces","- for the last few hundred years emotional intensity and reaction have often been attached to hormonal teenagers going through puberty or even people with higher social sensitivity. as society progresses, variables like time of day are more common as standards of structure. specific correlations of emotions to hours and segmented periods of temporal change has been labeled as a psychological staple of all humans, dating back to the applications of the ancient greeks. these tests compare two very important aspects of life, the unpredictable and spontaneous nature of emotions, and the ordered structure of our 12 hour time schedule. these different emotions being anger, happiness, disgust, and sadness, which are induced using various medias. a spearman rank correlation coefficient test is used to understand statistically significant correlations between the two variables. then, an anova test is utilized to certify that the subjects used in the experiment were not more “emotional” or more receptive to certain emotions than the other. this is important to add because of emotion’s boundless nature. this project finally concludes that the specific time of day does not necessarily correlate to emotion, but rather that emotion is a much stronger virtue of the mind than previously thought.","brain waves, emotion, alpha wave","This research comes to the conclusion that there is in fact no statistically significant correlation between emotion intensity, and the time of day, we also know that various people do not have too different of emotion intensity/reception variables (People are not much naturally angrier than another). We would expect humans to be more variable, with emotions flipping like a coin, but we see here that reaction and emotions are much more inset, and are much stronger than previously expected. We also see that though it is expected for Teens to be more emotionally variable than their adult counterparts, this is proven wrong with relatively similar results, hormonal changes change more immediate reactions rather than overall emotion. 6. Future Opportunities This field of emotional informatics, and classifications is revolutionary, especially with this smaller scale application of EEG, this concept allows for higher groups of people to create, and apply higher level of tests. Usually, EEG’s are often upwards of thousands of dollars, with the design that is applied, and used in the aforementioned research, we are able to derive reasonable data sets. Some ways to clean up this experiment could be to use higher level machinery, such as MRI, and even internal EEG sensors, offering the highest level of recording. Though this has some limitations, direct applications of specific neurotransmitters to insight specific emotions could be helpful for a standard emotional response for easy recording, such as dopamine for happiness, and acetylcholine for anger. There are many fields to develop on, the brain is the last frontier of the human body and this experiment offers a new lense to worlds of psychoanalysis and consciousness, with lots of untapped potential. 7.","arhan surapaneni stanford university online high school redwood city, ca 94063 arhan@ohs.stanford.edu",
234,Design An Innovative Poker Akqj Game And Study  Players’ Psychological Characters,"poker is a very popular gambling game in casinos, but except professionals, most poker players lose money without applying probability statistics. this paper studies the poker probability by using a partial deck (a total 16 akqj cards with up to 6 players). the authors have used combination formula and derived general formulas of matching probability for each matching pattern. to simplify probability simulation, partial deck poker game was designed which can increase the matching probability significantly on some higher ranked patterns such as “full house”. with this creative akqj game, the winning patterns are down to “four of a kind”, “full house”, “three of a kind”, and “two pairs”. if all 6 players are playing, this poker akqj game can be very competitive since the basic poker probability would be calculated to guide each poker player on their betting to avoid any risky move. to study the player’s personality and psychology, each player has been assigned different playing characters based on the assigned degree of risk taking. through this poker akqj data simulation based on the worst-case probability, the poker players may avoid gambling disorder and lose a lot of money.","modeling, statistics, jmp, poker",This innovative AKQJ Poker Game has significantly simplified the winning probability calculation. The worst- case algorithm has made it feasible that the Poker players could calculate their overall winning probability and make a rational betting decision based on their pre-set risk-taking character. The simplified AKQJ game has significantly minimized the players’ emotional character and limit players’ tricks to confuse the winning probability. The winner of each run becomes more random and less dependent on players’ psychological characters while calculating the winning probability quickly in real poker game becomes more critical.

235,“Steams” Methodology Of Nba Draft Player Position,"this paper adopts steams (science, technology, engineering, artificial intelligence, math, statistics) methodology. the objective of this paper is to introduce the benefits of integrating all 6 “steams” elements, especially living in the big data world. the nba draft position case study was demonstrated to present this novel “steams” concept as compared to the current “stem” or” steam” approach. there are three core visions of this “steams” methodology: (1) replace “art” with “artificial intelligence”, (2) separate “statistics” from “math”, and (3) integrate all six “steams” elements. adding the “artificial intelligence” element can trigger and enhance the effectiveness of “sports” science research and “math” algorithms. separating the “statistics” element can conduct more effective risk management and draw practical conclusions. due to the previous two benefits, integrating all 6 “steams” elements is becoming a widespread methodology for most scientists and engineers working in the modern big data era. several techniques are used to help determine the nba player position and identify the similar nba players for the benchmarking objective. it’s critical and urgent for educators and teachers to abandon the traditional stem approach to adopt the new “steams” approach to educate our next generations in their early school learning and career development.","jmp, modeling, simulation, statistics","“STEAMS” methodology is very successful on understanding Basketball Sports Science. Understanding the NBA Pre-Draft Combine Measurement and Testing can be done effectively through a systematic “Engineering” problem solving framework. Modern “Artificial Intelligence” methods can help determine player’s NBA preferable SF position and similar players. Hierarchical clustering distance mathematics is critical to determine the clustering dendrogram patterns. Benchmarking players’ statistics can be compared by using the descriptive statistics. In the modern Big Data era, most scientists and engineers shall adopt this “STEAMS” methodology and integrate all 6 elements seamlessly and collectively.

236,Search Space Restriction For Ucsp In Genetic Algorithms  Via A Novel Random-Key Decoder,"the university class scheduling problem (ucsp), or the process of building a class schedule for a university, has been a difficult problem in computer science due to its combinatorial complexity and multi-objective nature. as a result, several heuristic-based approaches have been tested, one being the genetic algorithm (ga). the application of gas to this problem has presented its own difficulties due to the generation of infeasible solutions. thus, this article presents novel methods of decoding random-key genetic representations such that only feasible solutions are generated. it is then demonstrated empirically that these modifications still constitute a viable algorithm, and analytically that these changes affect no additional bias on the otherwise unmodified ga. going forward, similar, more generalized methods can be developed and applied to a wider range of problems.","schedule formation, genetic algorithm, optimization","This article presented a novel method of decoding random-keys to produce class schedules that satisfied a set of hard constraints. Empirical results were presented that demonstrated the viability of this method, and then mathematical analysis was employed to demonstrated that the method was unbiased. Overall this novel method appears to have promise going forward. Future research should be done to find new search space restriction methods and other areas of application. The methods employed here are unfortunately limited to the scope of UCSP and related problems, however some of the basic concepts can be applied elsewhere. Since it was shown that uniform randomness, probabilistically speaking, can be preserved through a wide variety of transformations, more inventive decoders can be developed and tested. The one drawback with these search space restricting decoders is their computational load. They are far less efficient than index-related decoders, and thus take significantly longer to translate a representation into an actual data structure.

237,Strategic  Integrated,"south african transportation still faces quite a few challenges despite the implementation of brt systems across various metropolitan cities. these include, “lack of public transport accessibility in semi- urban areas, low ridership, equity imbalances and traffic congestion”. observations have revealed that the brt has not been effective in meeting all its objectives. this paper evaluates the strategic integrated transport growth and development in south africa particularly focus on the city of johannesburg based rea vaya. a qualitative research design using one-on-one semi-structured interviews was used for data collection. twelve participants were purposefully selected, which included the commuters, drivers, cleaners, fare collectors, security officers, and managers who had been working or using the brt transport system for not less than a year. qualitative content analysis techniques were used for analysing the data and providing an audit trail; the writing of thick descriptions and a reflexive journal were used to attain research quality. the findings suggest that there is a high number of car ownership, overpopulation, large brt lanes, road renovations and traffic light malfunctioning are responsible for traffic congestion in the city of johannesburg. in spite of the introduction of brt system that was developed to foster integrated transport particularly with an intention to encourage sustainable growth and development. furthermore, findings revealed that the impact of the brt transport system in the city of johannesburg was positive in terms of saving travelling time, low-prices and creating job opportunities. while the negative impact is that the advent of brt has led to the closure of small businesses that are located on the road. poor service delivery, corruption, resistance by taxi drivers, disrespectful passengers, inadequate number of buses, and poor remuneration for the employees and interference by road users, were found to be the challenges of the brt operational system.",brt,,"transport for growth and development strategy in south africa, a focus on rea vaya brt. mamogege desiree sekgale and nelson madonsela (mamogege desiree sekgale, department of operations management university of johannesburg, p.o box 17011, doornfontein, 2028, mssekgale@uj.ac.za, dsekgale@gmail.com) (dr nelson madonsela, department of operations management university of johannesburg, p.o box 17011, doornfontein, 2028, nmadonsela@uj.ac.za)","References

238,Collision Avoidance Technology:  The Use Of Fourth Industrial Revolution (4Ir) For Safe,"a mining company called “kanyon coal mine” is introducing collision avoidance technology as a means to minimize accidents and incidents, this is in line with global trends for safe mining. the mine is introducing collision avoidance through radar, global positioning system (gps), and global system for mobile communications (gsm). this paper is a study of the effects of introducing new technology to the existing one; the use of technology for safe mining. the mining equipment is upgraded with new technology at the coal mine and this created an unintended problem of safety, the mining equipment uses echolocation, gps, gsm, and rader as means to assess possible collision of machines with each other in the dark, during poor visibility or due to operator negligence. all these systems we call “anti-collision system”, these translate to an “emergency engine kill switch” (eeks) in case the driver is unaware of the pending danger, which will result in the switching off of the engine and engaging the braking system, by locking the wheels in place, the problem here is; after the power dies what will happen to the momentum of the truck, and what are the safety measures to counter slip of the locked wheels on gravel roads, resulting in a deadweight collision anyway. the study investigated the braking system, the slope and the mechanics the truck in statics. the paper argues that the unintended consequence is as a results of doing as engine kill on a wrong slope level, this was studied intently using coulomb’s law and results presented.","vehicle dynamics, breaking systems, friction, slope","Mechanical engineering work primarily rely on problem solving while mechanical equipment is supplied standard from the manufacture or suppliers. However, because there are different departments in industry pushing for maximum production at minimum cost, there are codes and practices that are modified, in some instances, some even ‘cut corners’. For example, there is a minimum slope angle for open cast mining but in reality user experience has been pushing boundaries and making a mismatch between legal requirements and codes of practice, in a sense that the mechanical engineer’s job is to harmonize these two to ensure maximum safe working environment for the people and the machines.

239,Adoption Of E-Commerce By Zimbabwean Hotels: An  Empirical Study,"this paper uses technology organisation environment framework to investigate the adoption of e-commerce by zimbabwe's hotel industry. adoption of e-commerce in the hospitality industry has been found by other studies to vary in different locations and to be influenced by factors that also tend to vary by location. this makes it difficult for findings to be generalised across different domains. to enable informed investment and policymaking decision it is necessary to conduct a country-specific enquiry into the factors that influence e-commerce adoption in a sector. this paper explores e-commerce adoption in the wider context of e-readiness in zimbabwe's travel and hospitality sector. a qualitative methodology under an interpretivist philosophy was used for this research and findings show that the inhibitors to e-commerce adoption were mainly at organisational level because of the lack of management support, organisational structure, organisational support and organisational readiness. on the other hand, the highest number of enablers were environmental factors that were due to customer and supplier expectation as well as competitive pressure from other hotels.","e-commerce adoption, developing country, zimbabwe, tourism",,"nyasha caroline moyo women’s university in africa harare, zimbabwe nycamoyo@gmail.com sam takavarasha jr women’s university in africa harare, zimbabwe stjnr1@gmail.com , stakavarasha@wua.ac.zw",
240,A Literature Review On The Impact Of Municipal Densityrelated Strategies On The Feasibility Of Real Estate,"this paper is a literature review on the importance and impact of municipal density-related strategies on real estate developments. developers focus on maximizing profit. therefore a feasibility should be conducted and the profitability assessed. municipalities have an influence on the development opportunities as urban spacial planning and land use management indicates the density permitted. the density of developments in turn affects the feasibility of developments in some way, whether through delays, extended timeframes or policy amendments. further research will follow, analysing the feasibility of development projects, testing the impact of various densities for each project.","density, feasibility","It can be concluded from the literature study that the amendment of strategic plans, which could include density- related strategies, is considered a valid risk, which is mostly present in the pre-development stage of the development process. Furthermore, the scale and nature of the development will affect the degree at which the amended density will impact the feasibility of a residential development.","developments zara marais, michelle burger & benita zulch department of construction economics university of pretoria pretoria, south africa michelle.burger@up.ac.za",
241,Majority Voting Ensemble Learning For Intrusion Detection  Using Recursive Feature Elimination,"intrusion detection has become a popular solution of mitigating cyber-attacks in this technological era. deep learning algorithm have become the go to solution in developing intelligent intrusion detection models and they have been successful. however, deep learning algorithms are too slow in training and this may not be effective for real time applications. therefore, we propose to develop a faster intrusion detection model using a novel majority voting ensemble with random forest recursive feature elimination to improve computation time as well as the detection rate. by including the random forest recursive feature elimination in the proposed model, redundant features will be removed while maintaining the most discriminative features. we evaluated the efficacy of the proposed model on the cicids 2017 dataset. in addition, we compared our model with deep learning algorithms which include resnet50, lstm and ae-fcn. the experimental results showed that our proposed model outperformed the other deep learning algorithms in terms of accuracy, precision, recall and computation time.","intrusion detection, cyber-attacks, machine learning","Intrusion detection has and still is a popular problem in this digital age. This is because the nature of attacks are always evolving making it difficult to develop intrusion detection systems that detect them with the precision of a surgeon. The proposed model was highly focused on the reduction of the dimensionality of the features to improve both accuracy and computation time. The results showed that the proposed model is an excellent tool for developing intrusion detection models because of its superior performance compared to deep learning classifiers. The proposal also supported our hypothesis, which states that feature selection can improve the computation time since it was the fastest in comparison with the deep learning models. The results of the experimental study also showed that Resnet50, LSTM and AE-FCN are highly effective in detecting DDoS attacks. The main limitation of this body of work was the unbalanced structure of the CICIDS 2017 dataset. Therefore, we would like to create a balanced dataset as part of our future work.","kudakwashe zvarevashe, prudence kadebu, addlight mukwazvure and fungai mukora faculty of computer engineering, informatics and communication university of zimbabwe harare, mi 48075, zimbabwe zvarevashek@schooloftechnology.ac.uz, kadebup@schooloftechnology.ac.uz, mukwazvurea@schooloftechnology.ac.uz, mukoraf@schooloftechnology.ac.uz tatenda trust gotora computer science department midlands state university gweru, zimbabwe tatenda.gotora88@gmail.com",

243,Real Time Gesture-Controlled Mobile Robot Using A Myo  Armband,"in this work, we demonstrate a hand-gesture controlled mobile robot with omni-directional movement capability. hand-gesture control is achieved using a myo armband. when compared to a hand-held control device, hand-gesture control has the advantage of full robot observability rather than having the operator mainly focusing on the remote control device. myo armband control has the primary advantage of low-cost and significantly fewer computing algorithms when compared to a vision-based gesture control. in this work, the hand gesture is recognized using an wearable arm device, which has emg sensors that measure the electrical signals from muscles in the arm. based on the contraction and rest movements of the muscles, the signals are used to control the locomotion of the mobile robot.","mobile robot, emg","and Future Perspectives In this paper we demonstrate the use of the Myo armband, developed by Thalmic Labs, for gesture recognition and control of a mobile robot. With the controller being a wearable device, the operator gains full awareness of both his/her own and the robot's surroundings. The robot control successfully exhibited real-time human-robot interaction through hand gesture using a low-cost EMG noninvasive device. The utilization of the armband control requires a short training by the user. The main drawback of the armband control is the small number of movements of the mobile robot that can be controlled, hence, for medical applications, controllability of a multi-axes robotic manipulator may not be achievable with the armband. For a robotic unit to reach any point in its working space, a minimum of six degrees-of-freedom are needed other than the movements required by the end-of-arm tooling. Furthermore, the armband accuracy and precision in acquiring gesture data may differ from user to another, both inaccuracy in acquisition of hand gestures and inability to detect gesture signals may be magnified in users with medical conditions in which muscular movement is impaired or the motor performance is limited such as in Parkinson’s disease [8]. Furthermore, recent studies show that electromyographic signals generated from muscles of patients of Parkinson’s disease can change considerably in patients who undergo Deep Brain Stimulation treatment [9]. Although a small number of degrees of freedom may be controlled with the armband, particularly in persons with impaired muscular functionality such as in patients of Parkinson’s disease, Myoclonus, and Tremor, however, secondary auto-assist systems may aide collaboratively to achieve full control. Such as including a secondary controller, a built-in obstacle avoidance functionality, force sensing, and vision-based perception capabilities for more robust operation, as well as including a return-to-home functionality to overcome potential loss of signal from the Myo armband. Future perspectives include determining the precision and accuracy rates of acquisition of gestures in persons with impaired muscular functionality such as in patients of Myoclonus, which causes sudden muscle jerks [10], and the involuntary oscillation of a body part referred to as Tremor [11], and Parkinson’s disease.

244,Abstract  Continuous Quality Improvement Is One Of The Keys For Business Success As Well As Business Problem Solving. Six Sigma Is The,,,"In this study, six sigma methodology (DMAIC) has been applied on the gluing operation at Al-Noor factory. Initially, the number of defective units at gluing section was considered as significant and needed to be improved. After Data collection and Analysis, three factors (speed, pressure level and pressure time) were considered as potential causes. The most influential causes have been identified as speed and pressure time and their optimal levels were suggested to be at 175 (sheet/hr) and for 2 (sec). After applying the new recommended levels, the number of defective units has been significantly decreases from 297 to 101 units, which consequently increased the level of sigma from 2.2 to 2.91.

The implemented Model that selects the set of branches that will fulfill customer nodes demand at the minimum cost, resulted in 20 and 18 branches, corresponding to Bank A and Bank B respectively, with significant cost savings. Actually, by closing 10 branches, a total of SR51.7 M (around US$13.7 M) per year will be saved. After presenting these results to the Merger Integration team, a second scenario where capacity and demand are not considered emerged. In fact, the Merger Integration team wanted to quantify the potential savings if the minimum number of branches that will cover all the customer nodes is kept open, without necessarily fulfilling the required demand. While fulfilling demand constraint is necessary to have a realistic and feasible solution, the Merger Integration team wanted to investigate this scenario, quantify the potential savings, and expand capacity (if needed) later on. For this scenario, a new Mathematical Model was built and consisted of a Set Covering Model where the customer nodes are covered with the minimum number of Branches.

More stealth detection techniques are being developed to ensure the Malware analysis does not leave a trace of the analysis performed in a virtual environment it does not give the Malware author an advantage. Dynamic and static Malware Analysis techniques are commonly applied with Hybrid techniques yielding better results by harnessing the strengths of the two types of analysis. Malware authors aim to bypass the defenses by applying techniques such as obfuscation, anti-debugging, anti-disassembling, sandbox evasion, antivirus evasion etc. Sandboxing is key in Malware analysis so as to prevent risks of executing infected files in the system.

249,"Towards A New Philosophy For Repositioning, And  Repurposing Technical And Vocational Education And","this paper anchors and grounds the culture, and architecture of technical and vocational education and training in africa which was vibrant and later drowned by colonization. african governments failed to domesticate and embody decolonization curriculum strategies and deploy budgets to promote and enhance heritage based tvet educational philosophies. the tvet dna architecture in africa was grounded in various cultural settings from creation. the creator (god) illustrated the power and philosophy of tvet when he created the universe with all the plethora of living and non-living, genesis 1. the universe is typical example of industrial engineering and operations management system. nations are built and sustained through tvet industrial engineering and operations management systems. the researcher will argue that the tenets of african tvet philosophy were intercepted, interrupted and bastardised by slavery and colonization. resultantly foreign-centric technologies and culture permeate and perpetuate dependency syndrome to the detriment of african industrial engineering and operations management systems. africa is now a vast warehouse for everything foreign inclusive of the education, health, industrial, technological and engineering systems. paradigm paralysis is domiciled in africa to the extent that industrialisation appears to be a distant cousin having been relegated by slavery and colonisation. drucker (1985) notes that a knowledge society is one in which the quality of life is dependent upon the primary production of knowledge as a resource instead of capital and labour as was the case in the agrarian and industrial economies. the researcher submits, and proffers possible gateways to circumvent some of these challenges from an afrocentric can perspective. the research is a mixed mode approach necessitated by the need to unbundle and unpack ontological reality, epistemological and existential shortcomings and shortfalls in the developmental agenda as exhibited by unsupported tvet policies in africa. zimbabwe will be at the core of the study.","architecture, culture, creator, colonization, endogenous","5.1 Empirical findings • Africa education ecosystem is rooted is foreign centric discourse. These alienate and disorient learners from the local context and push them to what to be identified with that which is foreign. • TVET knowledge acquisition is characterised by low conversion, under-utilisation and mis-utiliation, limited collaborations and networking. • Generally TVET knowledge workers’ qualifications are not commensurate with current global trends and the dichotomy of Industrial Engineering And Operational Management Systems. • TVET Knowledge Management system is hampered by lack of Afro-centric policy. • ICT plays a determining factor as key enabler and facilitator to the acquisition, sharing, networking and generation of Industrial Engineering and Operational Management Systems. 5.1.1 Recommendations Emanating from the implication of the research study as explored above, the researcher makes the following recommendations for effective and efficient Industrial Engineering and Operations Management In Africa. • TVET Knowledge Management practices and initiatives should be reasserted and repurposed to anchor national development in terms Industrial Engineering and Operational Management Systems. • Develop clear policies and philosophies that repurpose and support the implementation of national Industrial Engineering and Operational Management Systems in Technical Vocational Education and Training (TVET) embedded in indigenous knowledge systems. • Understand and emphasise practical approaches and solutions to create indigenous TVET Industrial Engineering and Operational Management Systems as a competitive edge. 5.1.2 Wayforward 5.1.3 This study opens opportunities for future research due to the complexity and limited resources of the researcher that ultimately affected the landscape of the research area to mainly polytechnics in Zimbabwe. Further appropriate research to validate the model used can be explored to determine if there is an optimal interrelationship of Knowledge Management processes and performances. 5.1.4 Conclusion This research study has managed to demonstrate that African governments through their education institutions need to rediscover, reposition, repurpose and reassert the philosophy of indigenous Technical Vocational Education and Training for national reskilling, industrial engineering and operational management.

250,Genetic Purity Solutions And Associated. Algorithms For  Conforming Seed Lots Or (Any Industrial Blend) To,"seed certification prerequisites trade and marketing of crop seed varieties within and across countries or global regions. a seed lot can only be certified if it meets minimum quality of genetic and physical purity standards as enshrined in certification schemes of certifying authority or agency of respective organisations, countries, or regions. the quality standards set may vary considerably across seed certification schemes. meeting of genetic purity standards in maize seed production requires distance and time isolation husbandry techniques in the separation of seed production fields from sources of foreign pollen in neighbouring contaminant maize fields. these two seed field isolation techniques however require minimisation in response to ever rising pressure on land and tight turn around cropping schedules in farms. essias michael kok (1985), with help of ephrame kudzaishe havazvidi, showed that minimum distance isolation set for certification of maize seed crops could be reduced to 122 metres provided that the protected maize seed crop is planted on the leeward side of the potential contaminant maize crop and that the synchronisation (or nicking) of pollen shed in the male parent of the seed maize crop with silking period in the female parent of the protected seed maize crop is perfect. time isolation technique obviates distance separation of seed fields from potential contaminant maize crops and furthermore removes wind current challenges which may reduce effectiveness of distance isolation. ephrame kudzaishe havazvidi (1989) derived time isolation formulae and quantified safety factors in the formulae to ensure reliability in their effectiveness. he derived time isolation constants specific to the genetic constitution of female parents of the different seed maize crops i.e. inbred females, sisterline cross females and single cross females, respectively. corrective measures to conform excessive genetic contamination of seed maize to certification standards set can be taken using algorithms derived by the author (unpublished). the principle behind ephrame kudzaishe havazvidi’s algorithms lies in the mixing or blending of inferior quantities of seed lots with specified quantities of seed lots containing much higher genetic or physical quantity fractions than those stipulated in seed certification schemes in question. these algorithms can also be applied in other industrial blending or stoichiometric formulations.","1.certifiation, 2. isolation, 3. contamination, 4. blending","Distance Isolations in the prevention of genetic contamination in seed maize production, can be revised backwards particularly when good pollinator male parents and good synchronisation of flowering of male and female parents are ensured. Effective Time Isolation of seed maize crops from maize contamination can be calculated from Havazvidi (1989) C1 and C2 Formulae inserting safety parameters estimated in this project. Seed Lots not meeting Seed Certification can be reclaimed by blending with above Standard Seed Lots using Havazvidi (2014). Blending Algorithms provided the seed contaminant does not corrupt the resultant seed blend.

251,Does Gender Identification At Birth Correlate With Empathy  Level?,"the study discussed below is one that centers around the following research question: is gender identification at birth correlated with empathy level? in understanding the empathy levels of humans, one can gain insight into the topic of empathy with relation to gender and the role that empathy of different genders plays in human society. moreover, this study holds the possibility of illustrating that transgender people mentally identify with the empathy levels of an alternative gender, contributing to a higher level of understanding from human society. in understanding those who are transgender more fully, studies such this one could increase societal toleration, allowing transgender people the acceptance they deserve. after collecting dozens of responses via a virtual survey, the collected data was analyzed via the chi square test for association and the mann-whitney u-test. ultimately, both tests determined that the collected data was highly statistically significant, indicating that gender identification at birth is correlated with empathy level. key words empathy, gender, statistics, correlation, nature 1. introduction first, the motivation and basis for this study will be discussed, and some scientific information will be included. additionally, the hypothesis developed prior to carrying out this study will be detailed. often, human females are assumed by society to be the most altruistic or empathetic of the genders (christov- moore, leonardo, et al., 2014). what was intriguing about this commonly believed assumption is that females of specific species in nature tend to be less empathetic than male organisms as shown by the routine consumption of their mates and young (suttle, 1999). these same behaviors have been predicted and observed in male organisms of specific species more rarely (revynthi, a.m., et al., 2018). consider the example of the male black widow spider. this illustrates the contrast between the empathy of different genders in the animal kingdom, contributing to the question as to how human empathy appears different between genders. interested in both the sharp contrast between nature versus human society and the assumption that females are more empathetic, the authors carried out this study in order to determine the answer to the following question: is gender identification at birth correlated with empathy level? unlike other studies which have conducted research regarding wild animal behavior with regard to empathy, this study will provide an interesting contrast to studies regarding wild animals. by comparing human empathy to the empathy of wild animals, one can gain insight into the role of empathy and how it differs in human society. after considering the above question with regard to personal experience, the following hypothesis was developed: gender identification at birth does correlate with empathy level. a study such as this one is pertinent to society today and is growing more and more relevant to society's discussions. in a world where so many assumptions are simply made without basis, finding the “truth” is a hugely valuable endeavor. in studying this topic, the objective is to determine if the common assumptions made about male, female, or alternate gender empathy levels are accurate, scientifically and statistically. based on research, my preliminary belief is that the empathy level of males will be lower than that of females. 2. methods in this portion of my paper, the materials used to carry out this study will be discussed. further, the method used to carry out this study will be described. this study did not require a great deal of materials to yield statistical data. after collecting statistical data, several procedures were carried, specifically statistical tests. proceedings of the 2nd african international conference on industrial engineering and operations management harare, zimbabwe, december 7-10, 2020 © ieom society international 2518",,"based on the results of this test. Because the data collected falls on the ordinal and nominal scales, it is only logical to use the Mann-Whitney U-test as it is a nonparametric test. The null hypothesis for this experiment is as follows: there is no difference between the average empathy levels of males versus females. The alternative hypothesis for this experiment is as follows: there is a significant difference between the average empathy levels of males versus females. Table 4.

252,"Ocean Acidification, Simulated Statistical Investigation","this study was motivated by the primary investigator’s love for the environment. specifically, an interest in ocean acidification led to the process described in which common brine shrimp were used to simulate the impact of acidification on the world’s oceans. through the use of white, distilled vinegar acting as the “acidification” for the simulated conditions, three populations of brine shrimp were monitored before, during, and after varying levels of acid were added to their individual habitats. analyses of the data utilizing the kruskal-wallis tests and chi-square test for association were implemented to compare the effect of acid levels on brine shrimp survival. the results demonstrated statistically significant differences in the survival between the populations of brine shrimp as a function of varying acid concentrations utilizing the kruskal-wallis method. further, the results of the chi-square test for association demonstrated an association between the acid levels and brine shrimp populations. this investigation is significant because it provides insight into the damage that ocean acidification can cause to oceanic organisms and is demonstrative of the impact humans might be having on our global environment. key words ocean, acidification, statistics, correlation, chi-square 1. introduction this investigation studied the effects of human-induced acidification of the earth’s oceans in order to prove a specific point: namely that ocean acidification is harmful to our global environment and that continued increases in carbon dioxide levels as a result of human pollution are unsustainable and detrimental to the world. throughout the course of human habituation on earth, humans have seemingly thrived. while the constant advancement in human innovation has led to improved human livelihood, these advancements have also taken a huge toll on the environment. to study these issues, the growing environmental impact of ocean acidification was investigated. specifically, simulated conditions were created to monitor common brine shrimp survival in controlled environments with varying levels of acidification. the world's oceans absorb approximately one-third of the world’s carbon dioxide supply (fabry, v., et al., 2008 ), and the absorption of this carbon dioxide comes at a cost. ocean acidification, or “the other co2 problem,” is a major problem that has accompanied the increase in human populations and the resulting carbon dioxide levels for centuries, worsening as human populations continue to grow (doney and scott c., 2008). as a result, ocean acidification has contributed to the destruction of organisms, habitats, and ecosystems in our world’s oceans. further, ocean acidification has led to numerous mass extinctions (guinotte et al., 2008) as well as a decrease in calcification, the process by which organisms create calcium carbonate, a critical component of marine animal’s shells. for example, ocean acidification was likely responsible in part for the cretaceous-paleogene extinction (anthony, et al., 2008). a decrease in calcification means that cretaceous organisms are unable or less likely to be able to produce their protective shells. because ocean acidification is such a prominent problem but receives so little attention, the main study objective was to simulate the effects of increased acid levels on our ocean on marine wildlife. 2. relationship between shrimp and acidity throughout this section, the specific methods and materials used by the researcher will be outlined. from background research, the investigator formed a hypothesis from which they compared their results to. in this section, proceedings of the 2nd african international conference on industrial engineering and operations management harare, zimbabwe, december 7-10, 2020 © ieom society international 2527",,"From these statistical results, one is able to understand that a Kruskal Wallis test run between the medians of the populations of brine shrimp per quadrat before the addition of vinegar does not produce a statistically significant result. Thus, it is most likely that the drop in population sizes was not due to an outside factor but due solely to the addition of white vinegar. The second Kruskal-Wallis test run between the populations of brine shrimp (in medians) after the addition of vinegar demonstrated a statistically significant difference between the medians of the populations of brine shrimp once vinegar was added. Finally, the use of a Chi-Square Test for Association shows that there was, in fact, an association between the levels of acid in the three tanks and the amount of brine shrimp that remained living. Overall, the data did support the original hypothesis that there was an association and relationship between the levels of acidity and the populations of brine shrimp for each quadrat. The conclusions that can be drawn from the statistical analyses done are numerous. To begin, one is first able to conclude that there was an association between the levels of vinegar in the brine shrimp tanks and the populations of the brine shrimp (per quadrat). This is important because it supports the conclusion that, on a larger scale, ocean acidification directly affects organisms. If this study were to be replicated on a larger and more complex scale, it is likely that it would produce similar results. One can hope that if more people were made aware of such findings that they would take more steps toward stopping ocean acidification. Further, this experiment also allows one to draw the conclusion that vinegar is in fact acidic and that even a low acidic pH such as 2.4 can be detrimental to a population. That is, one is able to conclude that even a low acidic pH can make a large difference. 5.

255,Improving The Students Of The Efl Speaking Class,"public speaking is one of the conditional subjects that should be pursued by higher education students. it offers students the ability to talk as a subject of learning with a voice. some of the components of speech that should be measured by students include comprehension, vocabulary, pronunciation , and grammar. this research was a descriptive study designed to explain students ' speaking skills that were acceptable for speech indicators. the population was seventh semester students of the english department of stai miftahul ula, a total sample of 40 students was used. the research instrument used the speech test to test the validity and reliability of the test. the data was analyzed using the percentage formula. based on the finding of the result , it was found that the capacity of students to talk in a speech was in different categories. in comprehension, the majority of students were strongly categorized (62.5 per cent), therefore the student's fluency in speech ordering was high categorized (67.5 per cent). when the vocabulary was chosen and the words pronounced, 55 % of students got better, but in grammar, students still have a problem. the data showed that only 32.5 percent of students had a high category.",,"And Suggestion 4.1. Conclusion The product of students' ability to talk in public speaking classes is usually defined as high ability. More than 50 percent of the students had a good speech score. 30 per cent of students had a middle ability to speak and 15 per cent of students had a low ability to speak. Specifically, comprehension can be classified as a high skill, with 62.5 percent of students recognizing the ability to speak in a public speaking class. Fluency has been classified as high capacity; 67.5 percent of students have a strong fluency score. Vocabulary is the next part. In delivering a speech, students scored well in using vocabulary; 5 % of students ranked poor ability to use vocabulary. Student pronunciation also had a decent speech rate. 52.5 percent of students were classified as having a high ability to pronounce words in speech. Last, students' grammar has a middle capacity. 32.5 per cent of students were categorized as high, 50 per cent of students were categorized as middle, and 17.5 per cent of students were categorized as poor grammatical capacity to express speech in public speaking classes. 4.2. Suggestion The students of STAI Miftahul Ula Nganjuk can be categorized into high ability in using some of components of speaking skill in public speaking class. But it is not enough, by the students who learn in English department ideally can speak well in English for public situation. It needs the improvement and effort from the students. The students need to know their skill in speaking. Besides that, the students should practice more outside of the English department environment. By evaluating students’ speaking skill, it can be information to the students to develop their skill in speaking.

Our objective was the proposition of a conceptual modeling approach at a tactical level and provides a model builder with guidelines. According to the characteristics of the delocalization phenomena described in Hammami (2008), we identified those characteristics adapted to automotive assembly industry. In light of this preliminary step, we identified the most relevant keys dimensions that should be incorporated in an automotive assembly supply chain design model that is adapted to the delocalization problem at a tactical level. Most factors highlighted were: BOM constraints, transportation, inventory cost and labor costs evolution. We selected the papers according three criteria: the last published in the subject, famous specialist author on supply chain, the most relevant paper identified in the literature review in particular in Hammami (2008), and classified them according to four dimensions (decisions, cost factors, constraints and other supply chain aspects), which regroup the delocalization features in tactical level. The results resumed in Table 3 which confirm that Hammami (2013) paper is the best one including the most relevant delocalization features, indeed it focused in their impact on the lead time. We can also take notice the inventory management allocation is not issues have not received an adequate attention as well as the labor cost evolution, Inventory cost, transport cost and BOM constraints. Based on the literature review and on our own professional experience, we can assure that inventory allocation management cost and the transport cost are the success keys of delocalization that must have more focus in the future supply chain modeling design, particularly in delocalization context. Furthermore, the pandemic due to covid19 confirmed the importance position of transport and inventory management in supply chain especially that the china role in the global economy is increasing, and it was the first country impacted by the pandemic crisis. We then proposed an algorithm approach for modeling supply chains at a tactical level in the delocalization context that can help a model builder to construct an analytical model for designing the supply chain in the delocalization context.

259,Performance Evaluation Of Some Selected Mediums Wind  Energy Conversion System For Wind Power Generation At,"energy is a crucial component to every nation’s economic and social growth. mitigation of global energy demands and climate change are essential factors for renewable energy supplies in recent times. this paper presents the performance evaluation of some selected mediums wind energy conversion system for wind power generation at anyigba, nigeria. wind speed data for this work was collected at 4m height from the campbell scientific automated weather station under the tropospheric data acquisition network (trodan). the data is at an interval of five (5) minutes update cycle for sixty months. the wind speed data height was then interpolated to 20m using a power-law relationship. three selected wind energy conversation system (wecs), were used for the wind power evaluation. the result indicated the wind energy conversion system-30 (wes-30) as suitable for anyigba. 4.961m/s was the highest wind speed obtained in february 2016 while 1.135m/s was the lowest wind speed in november 2015. this might be linked to the dry season and the rainy season for the high and low wind speeds. using the weibull model, the average scale parameter and shape parameter value are 0.88 in november and 6.31 m/s in january of the entire months","wind energy, trodan, 2016)(salim et al.","In-situ measurements of wind speed, in Anyigba have been achieved for the purpose of evaluating it for electricity generation and the following conclusions are drawn. Wind energy is the fastest growing technology and energy resources in the world, and it can be reusable. There have been a rapid development on this technology, this is due to its cleanness and reusability. Wind energy is an alternative renewable source of energy compared to all other sources of energy derived from fossil fuels that pollute the lower parts of the atmosphere. While concerns such as environmental pollution and energy supply requirements are growing, it is important to make use of a pollution-free energy like wind. Also the wind turbines can be used to convert the wind energy to more commonly used electric energy. Wind speed is the most critical parameter of the power that was generated from wind turbines.

260,Develop Troop Strength Metric Of Playing Strategic Video  Game,"the project displays on how to use clustering methods to help study environmental science when playing the strategic video games. the main focus is on phase ii where in the game, soldiers attack nearby weaker opponents. the objective of the game is to create kingdoms, produce resources (wood, stone) to build castles and then form an alliance to defeat enemies. therefore; the main question is “how to build a powerful troop/castle”? first, we need to know the types of troops needed to build a castle. in phase ii, there are up to 45 types of troop units which are mostly used for attacking and defending. there are seven characteristics for each troop unit which are melee/range defense, melee/range attack, travel speed, looting capacity, and food consumption. the objective of this paper is to introduce an advanced multivariate statistical methodology for advancement through the empire 4 kingdoms strategic video game. a novel troop power index (pi) is derived that captures the objective of developing a powerful troop army and expanding the size of one’s own kingdom. the power index applies specified weighting coefficients that consider how to build a powerful troop army which can both attack and defend well, have good looting capability and speedy travel capacity, and minimize food consumption. ater the pi was established, the following were considered (1) summation/ weighting of the untransformed pi, (2) z-transformed pi, and (3) non-parametric transformed pi, in order to reduce the variance bias and the impact to outliers among the seven troop characteristics. approaches (1) through (3) were compared to determine their unique characteristics in the distribution of relative pi ranks among the troops. next, supervised clustering based on power index (4 clusters) and unsupervised jmp hierarchical clustering were used (8 clusters) to select the top vital few troops from each cluster based on pi ranking. the non- parametric method was assessed to be the best model to optimize the troop units since most of the troop characteristics were highly skewed. the troop types considered fit to the kingdom expansion strategy were reduced from 45 to 15, therefore, based on the non-parametric troop pi ranking. in future work, transfer function sensitivity analysis may be explored within the troop constraints in order to further optimally select the troop units to meet the current kingdom expansion strategy.","statistics, multivariate, jmp, steams",,"logeshwari chandramohan 2024 student cohort adrian wilcox high school santa clara, ca 95051, usa five4ty5@gmail.com mason chen stanford university ohs stanford university palo alto, ca 94305, usa mason.chen.training@gmail.com",

262,The Implementation Of Managerial Governance And  Organization Theory Crisis,"the economic liberalization, political democratization and governmental decentralization have significantly brought about changes in the public sector management. the dominant roles of the state as a regulator as well as provider of public goods and services have massively eroded, and subsequently replaced by society (non-state actors). consequently, the vertical relationships among actors either within the state institution or, generally, in social relations are getting out of fashion. at present, the model of government has been replaced by the newly model, that is, governance. in this model, the inter-organizational relationships grow to be much more significant characteristic, rather than inter-organizational patterns.many practitioners in government, who had habitually employed the hierarchical patterns, faced many difficulties to understand and to place their position in these chaotic and anarchical situations. meanwhile, the organization theories, which have widely focused in the inter- organizational model, have no significant contributions to cope with these changes. this paper endeavours to search for a new model of relation management, which possibly captures the more horizontal relationships in inter-organizational arenas..","governance, orde baru era","The changes of relational pattern and other consequences that already been discussed previously, is a part of contemporary change of society in reform era. According to Under and Peters, political world in reform era having two bid tendencies. First, the development of policy-making sector as the consequences of issue complexity of each sectors and professional groups growth. The implication is policy-making model which is monopolistic by state will be not popular any longer. Processes of policy-making will be done more often in a relatively open with relatively autonomous actors. Second, political world in this era also asking for society involving more in policy-making process. Nowadays developments put on participations not only as an instrument or a process of democratically policy- making, instead of participation become its own goal. It is very clear in good governance principles that become a dominant perspective in government reform. Its implication is policy-making is a bargaining process and negotiating nowadays, not to be insisted on and formulated by higher power hierarchy centrally. Problem which has to be answered by organizational theory is how to manage the connection of intra- organizational which area is open wider and its relations pattern is getting more horizontal. No wonder any kind of organizing models which applied will always set on its instrument, and at the end will define whether those processes are worth developing or not. in this context, the way to manage relations by networking model has a great potential to be developed in organizational theory. Even though there is a great chance of lose and win, but the problem is no longer on epistemological level (problem point of view) but on strategic level. Success in this model can be measured by the capability to build collective action based on common goals-making. Strategy which might be develop is, first, upgrading incentive structure in order to this networking become a magnet pole for actors to make a coordination and build a consensus-making. Second, upgrading actors managerial capability for network-making innovatively, so that, it will invite actors’ interaction in networking. Even though it is not easy to create theory formatting to formulate common action between actors that are not uniform and autonomous, but it is a challenge that must be answered by organizational theory.

(4) the results of the study using path analysis (path analysis) organizational culture and organizational communication have a positive and significant indirect effect on employee performance mediated by organizational commitment.","culture, communication, commitment, norms","From the results obtained, the hospital needs to improve the performance of its human resources. This is a demand that must be met because HR performance is closely related to the achievement of overall company performance, especially in, 1. The influence of organizational culture and organizational communication on employee performance, which states that the existing culture is not good enough to increase the level of employee performance 2. The influence of organizational culture and organizational communication has a positive and significant direct effect on organizational commitment because a firmly embedded organizational culture will form a maximum commitment 3. Organizational commitment has a positive and significant effect on employee performance, so that a high level of integrity will have a major contribution to the company 4.

265,The Effect Of Financial Performance Of Corporate Social  Responsibility Disclosure In Companies In Indonesia Stock,"the purpose of this study to determine the effect of corporate financial performance on csr disclosure (corporate social responsibility) registered on the indonesia stock exchange 2014-2016. financial performance is projected with return on asset, return on equity, and debt to equity ratio. corporate csr disclosure is measured using the gri (g4) aspect. the type of research is explanatory research. sampling method using purposive sampling with criteria of mining company listed in indonesia stock exchange and issuing annual report which during period 2014-2016. data analysis techniques use multiple linear regression. the results showed that the financial performance variable did not significantly influence the disclosure of social responsibility either partially or simultaneously. the results of the insignificant research indicate that this research is not in line with stakeholder theory but in line with legitimacy theory.","return on asset, return on equity, csr"," Return On Asset has no effect on CSR disclosure with argument in relationship between profitability and social responsibility disclosure level is when company have high profit, company not need to report things that disturb information about success of company finance. Conversely, when the level of profitability is low, they expect the report users to read the ""good news"" of the social and environmental performance that has been done by the company.  Return On Equity does not affect the cause of social responsibility activities is a new thing in Indonesia so that companies do not have full awareness to perform social responsibilities other than that CSR disclosure is still part of the ads made by the company to have a good image in the eyes of its stakeholders . This shows that not all companies that have good financial performance will have a good social responsibility. The Company will perform its social responsibilities in accordance with the environmental and political conditions in which the company is located. In addition, the role of government in overseeing social responsibility activities in Indonesia is also one of the supporting factors of responsibility level undertaken by the company.  Debt to Equity Ratio does not affect CSR disclosure due to the company related to Natural Resources has been obliged to conduct CSR activities which have been stipulated in the Constitution Number 40 year 2007, so big profitability does not affect CSR disclosure. However, for companies that are not related to HR can be the size of profitability affect the CSR activities and disclosure based on items set by GRI G4. 6. Suggestion The researcher may further extend the sample not only using a sample mining company but may include all companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange in order to result from the effect of profitability assuming ROA, ROE and DER on CSR disclosure is more significant. Subsequent research should not only use annual report only in obtaining data related to Corporate Social Responsibility done by company, but can also expand the scope by looking from reports on company website, print and electronic media. Researchers can then use or add other research variables that are not used in this study such as company age, public ownership, board size, media disclosure, etc. to further explain the effect of corporate characteristics on Corporate Social Responsibility.

282,Implementation Of Corporate Social Responsibility On  Corporate Reputation Through Social Capital,"autonomy of the community becomes a central theme of national development that is the responsibility of all elements of the nation's government, private and anyone and any organization. viewed from the standpoint of government, the support of village funds was very adequate for advanced development and helpless. alignments of other parties, example through corporate contributions to get involved in community development, empowerment towards sustainable development goals (sdg's). this involvement by the corporate as a form of responsibility for the business activities among the people or the so-called social responsibility (csr). path technique analysis used in this study with a sample of 100 respondents, the results showed the effects of implementing csr directly to the capital strengthening communities and improving the welfare of society as well as to the corporate image. another result is the implementation of csr that can explain the positive changes in the corporate's reputation through social capital and the improvement of public welfare. several things need attention in the context of the implementation of csr associated with social capital, social welfare and reputation of the corporate that csr programs should be able to increase the ability of sustainable society and strengthen the conception of csr in society.","empowerment, social capital, welfare, csr","The results of this study are the implementation of corporate social responsibility programs directly affect the strengthening of community capital, the implementation of corporate social responsibility programs directly influence the improvement of community welfare, the implementation of corporate social responsibility programs directly affect the corporate's image, and the implementation of corporate social responsibility programs can explain the positive changes in the corporate's reputation through community social capital and improvement of community welfare. Research results can be an opportunity for future managerial practices and research agendas. Managerial Practices; Several things need attention in the context of implementing CSR programs that are associated with social capital, community welfare and the reputation of the corporate including; a). CSR programs must be able to improve community capacity for long-term (sustainable) activities not in the context of spending program funds; b) The corporate must continue to encourage the recipient community to have the responsibility and ownership of the program implemented; and c) The corporate must implement a more concrete CSR program in increasing income economically because it is the primary objective in the concept of triple bottom CSR. The research agenda allows further research to add to the effectiveness variables of business institutions or business groups assisted by CSR programs.","strengthening and increasing community welfare sukaris management department, faculty of economics and business universitas muhammadiyah gresik, gresik regency, east java, indonesia sukaris21@umg.ac.id nadhirotul laily psychology study program, universitas muhammadiyah gresik, gresik regency, east java, indonesia nadhirotul.laily@umg.ac.id damarsari ratnasahara elisabeth management department sekolah tinggi ilmu ekonomi mahardhika surabaya, indonesia joko suyono department of management and business, narotama university surabaya, indonesia 60117 joko.suyono@narotama.ac.id hendra suwardana universitas pgri ronggolawe, tuban, indonesia, suwardanahendra@gmail.com",
283,A Review Of Property Attributes Influence In Hedonic  Pricing Model,"the property attributes – physical, neighbourhood and location attributes – are incorporated into hedonic pricing models (hpm) to determine property prices or evaluate the relative contribution of each attributes to the property prices. however, the findings of most studies on the influence of the property attributes on prices have been diverse. the directionality and quantum of influence are not static rather dynamic. therefore this paper reviewed previous hedonic pricing models studies and summarise the influence of property attributes on price. the review found that the magnitude and directionality of the property attributes influence on prices are not uniform but rather diverse depending on the property type, situations and consumer preference. the divergence of findings was found to be more common in the physical attributes and location attributes. the findings on neighbourhood attribute are relatively more uniform. this is because most of the neighbourhood attributes are both positive or negative externalities, and deals with the overall society rather than a single property. the review shows that most of the hedonic pricing model applications are in the housing market with fewer applications in the commercial property market. the paper recommends more application of the hedonic pricing model in the commercial property market.",location,,"hamza usman department of real estate management universiti tun hussein onn malaysia; department of estate management and valuation abubakar tafawa balewa university, bauchi, nigeria hamzeeusm@gmail.com mohd lizam and burhaida burhan department of real estate management faculty of technology management and business universiti tun hussein onn malaysia lizam@uthm.edu.my, burhaida@uthm.edu.my",
284,Review Of Issues In The Conventional Hedonic Property  Pricing Model,"the hedonic pricing model is extensively applied in property pricing modelling. it considers property as a bundled commodity and models its price as a function of its constituent parts – physical characteristics, neighbourhood attributes, and location factor. however, several issues in the conventional hpm hinder its accuracy in predicting property prices. this paper reviewed these issues with the ways of addressing them simultaneously. the review found the major issues in hpm include – normality of property prices, linearity, heteroskedasticity, multicollinearity, spatial dependence, spatial heterogeneity, spatial autocorrelation, and aggregation bias. these issues were found to substantially reduced the accuracy of property price modelling. these issues are minimised by specifying correct functional form which log-log specification was mostly found to be more efficient, dimension reduction using pca or factor analysis, and property market segmentation. the use of these measures significantly reduces estimation errors and improves model fit thereby increasing the accuracy of property price prediction. the review recommends caution in choosing the correct functional form a well as the application of property market segmentation in modelling property market using different methodologies.","heteroskedasticity, spatial dependence, autocorrelation",,"hamza usman department of real estate management universiti tun hussein onn malaysia; department of estate management and valuation abubakar tafawa balewa university, bauchi, nigeria hamzeeusm@gmail.com mohd lizam and burhaida burhan department of real estate management faculty of technology management and business universiti tun hussein onn malaysia lizam@uthm.edu.my, burhaida@uthm.edu.my",

They have limited knowhow and experienced employees that can implement it effectively. As a measure that can help to generate new ideas of reducing costs in restaurants, benchmarking needs to be a continuous process that has to be communicated among all employees. Training should be an on-going process with staff members so that they get support and work as a team. Training restaurateurs in benchmarking practices will lead to increased productivity, higher profit and improved service quality. This will enable them to understand their operations so as to gain more competitive advantage in the industry locally and internationally.",,

289,Monte Carlo Simulations In Poker And Gambling,"this project applies the monte carlo simulation, the authors were able to take a deeper look inside the human mind, with modern approaches to computer programming. the game of poker uses key strategies of wit and deception, all in all ending with the sickness of gambling. the monte carlo simulation uses the programming language python to set up a 6 player game of poker with a 16 card partial deck using the various face cards. this game counts only the full-house, 3 of a kind, pair, and high cards for winning combinations to maximize the data significance. in this game these characters have different thresholds in categories like checking, folding, and even betting, which is edited using various variables and wagers applied through a complex malleable percent confidence level interface in an effort to model real human psychology. these confidence levels affect how these players participate in the game. this results in players that are concise and specific, only betting when the cards have higher chances of winning, to players that bet no matter the cards that are presented. this program allows for numerous simulated rounds in seconds, while making advanced calculations on winning probability, and intricate hypothesis/correlation tests to deduce that gambling is not only harmful to the mind, but economically non-beneficial. this is only the first stepping stone for the possibilities that this simulation can explore, offering countless applications that simply have no limits. proceedings of the 2nd african international conference on industrial engineering and operations management harare, zimbabwe, december 7-10, 2020 © ieom society international 2842",,,"arhan surapaneni, siddhant karmali, mason chen, and saloni patel stanford online high school",

292,A Preliminary Study On The Relationship Between Financial  Literacy And Business Performance Among Entrepreneurs In,"entrepreneurs are the backbone of all prosperous economies worldwide, since they are regarded as a key driver of economic growth in creating job opportunities, eradicating poverty and leading to the production of both developed and emerging countries' gross domestic product (gdp). this paper presents the findings of a pilot survey aimed at validating a questionnaire explicitly designed to gather data on the relationship between financial literacy and business performance among entrepreneurs. a total of 37 sampled respondents were used in the analysis using a stratified and clear random sampling technique. the data were analyzed with the assistance of the statistical kit for social sciences (spss) version 23, of which the study of the variables and assessment of the reliability were carried out. as a result, only 44 of the 49 elements that initially formed the survey were retained. a total of 9 components emerged from the data that were named in accordance with their underlying constructs. the factor loadings reported met the appropriate threshold of .50. the reliability of the items and the respective scales was also within the acceptable range of .70. it was thus concluded that the questionnaire was reliable and could be used for the reason for which it was built.","factor analysis, pilot study, reliability","A Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was performed on 49 orthogonal rotation (varimax) items. The Kaiser – Meyer – Olkin test confirmed the sampling adequacy of the study, KMO = .715; .736; .715; .669; .835; .882; .864; .878 and .876. All values were above the acceptable limit of.5, which confirmed that the sample was sufficient for analysis (Williams, 2010). The Bartlett’s test of sphericity χ² were all less than .05 (p < .000), indicating that correlations between items were sufficiently large for principal component analysis (PCA). An initial analysis was run to obtain eigenvalues for each component in the data. Nine components had eigenvalues over Kaiser’s criterion of 1 and explained 61.42 %, 73.502 %, 73.502 %, 62.104 %,70.025 %, 79.735 %, 83.177 %, 82.482 %, 79.916 % variance in the respective factors extracted. The analyses resulted in retaining 41 items out of the 49 items that were originally included in the first draft of the questionnaire. The factor analysis result indicated that the 41 items can appropriately be clustered into 9 factors which were labelled Access to Credit, Financial Awareness, Debt Management, Book Keeping, Savings, Risk Management, Diversification, Sales and Employee Competency. The findings of reliability analysis revealed that all the scales were reliable which therefore lead to the conclusion that the questionnaire can be used to collect information from the broader population the main survey.","bauchi metropolis, nigeria khadija m. usama and wan fauziah w.y faculty of technology management, business, and entrepreneurship, university tun hussein onn malaysia khadeejahmhd@gmail.com, fauziah@uthm.edu.my",
293,Modeling  Covid-19 Cummulative Data In Indonesia Using  Morgan-Mercer-Flodin Growth Equation,"recently there are some mathematical models of covid-19 transmission have been developed in an attempt to understand the disease. various approaches of modeling have been devised by many authors which broadly divided into two different methods, the mechanistic modeling method and the empiric modeling method. in empirical modeling process ones usually look at the available covid-19 data such as the cumulative cases of insidence and the daily cases of incidence. the data of such cases are usually available from legit situs such as the worldometer website. this website provides total confirmed cases, daily new cases, daily active cases, daily death, etc. ones usually use the time series data of the total confirmed cases to fit with a certain growth model. in this paper we will model the covid-19 disease transmission by looking at the growth of the confirmed and daily new cases data. the growth model we choose is the morgan-mercer-flodin (mmf) equation. we use two methods depending on the minimization process of the rmse. we used the equation to model the covid-19 transmission of indonesia data starting from 2 march 2020, the official first day of the reported pandemic cases in indonesia, up to 30 november 2020. in applying the growth equations to the pandemic data we denoted that x(t) is the cumulative of confirmed case at time t. the calculation is done using solver in the microsoft excel application by choosing the grg nonlinear (generalized reduced gradient) for the oftimization to find the minimum root of the mean square error as the measure. the results show that both methods give relatively similar results and reveal the strongly dependence of prediction on the sufficiency number of data being used.","covid-19 pandemic, empirical model, indonesia, growth equation","We modeled the pandemic data of Indonesia (the total confirmed cases and the daily new cases) from the Worldometer website (Worldometer, 2020) using the Morgan-Mercer-Flodin (MMF) growth function. The results show that the MMF growth function fails to predict the long-term outcome due to the strong dependence of the method to the data. Sufficient data is needed to estimate the best parameter, hence the more accurate prediction can not be obtained in the case of lack of data. There are some reasons why the MMF growth function cannot predict this long-term outcome. One of them is when it is applied too early, in which the disease still in the exponential growth phase, then the method cannot locate the inflection point accurately.

However, evocative evidence to explain the role of IoT in and its impact on supply chain performance is vital to be investigated. Nevertheless, academic literature was found to have an outstanding gap in research that addressed the impact of IoT on companies’ supply chain performance measures – particularly within developing countries and this research was an attempt to fill this gap. Through findings of this study using the semi-structured interviews, all the interviewees spoke positively about the outcomes of IoT deployment in their companies to improve supply chain performance for their strategically, technically, and operationally levels. Further research would be recommended to further investigate the drivers and barriers of implementing the IoT along the supply chains and operations in developing countries.","maha abdel hamid morssi, hussein magdy elhusseiny and dina adel hammad logistics and supply chain management department, transport and logistics management department college of international transport and logistics arab academy for science, technology and maritime transport alexandria, egypt maha.morsy@aast.edu hussein.magdy89@gmail.com dina.hammed@aast.edu",

Conclusions From the regression equation that has been carried out from the SPSS.24 Stepwise Regression Analysis, it can be concluded that the factors that influence environmental cleanliness related to waste handling are: a. Garbage that is allowed to pile up around the environment. b. Garbage that is not put in a closed trash basket/bag. c. No garbage officer routinely pick up garbage from the house to the temporary disposal site. d. Community behavior that does not fully understand how to handle the waste. 5.2. Recommendations From the conclusions above, there are several recommendations for the Ngawi Regency Government to improve waste management and maintain environmental cleanliness, including: a. Clean and healthy behavior campaigns to increase public understanding of the waste problem so that this also affects people's habits in disposing of garbage. Awareness of providing trash in his house and throwing garbage in its place. b. Coaching efforts, socializing waste management policies, the dangers of waste to health and the environment, and providing training with the 3R principles (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle) to mobilize the community in simultaneous and continuous waste management. c. Increase the provision of solid waste infrastructure facilities (infrastructure) made to be closer to settlements and easily accessible to the community so that people do not experience difficulties disposing of waste. d. Local government also needs to provide transportation facilities and communal trash cans close to settlements and reachable to residents. The formation of community groups that care about environmental cleanliness is also required.","the quality of life hery subagio faculty of engineering, civil engineering, masters study program narotama university, surabaya, indonesia herysubagio_ir@yahoo.com rooslan edy santosa civil engineering department narotama university, surabaya, indonesia rooslan.edy@gmail.com, roos_edy@yahoo.com m. ikhsan setiawan civil engineering department narotama university, surabaya, indonesia ikhsan.setiawan@narotama.ac.id",

305,Survey Study And Analysis Of A Disproportion Of Cases And  Deaths For Minorities In Usa,"statistical analysis and survey were conducted for this study. recent data from the cdc shows that there is a significant disproportion between cases and deaths for minorities due to covid-19. a statistical analysis was conducted on the trends of cases and deaths for minorities compared to white americans. these statistics were found on the cdc’s website and were attained by research. the cdc claims american indians, african americans, and hispanics are four times more likely to be hospitalized and almost three more times likely to die due to covid than white americans. after learning this information, a survey was conducted on how much people viewed different causes (such as poverty and racism) attributed to this disproportion. those surveyed were asked to rate on a scale of one to five (one being least likely and five being extremely likely), how much they believed the causes given were the actual cause. the results were surprising. for most causes mentioned, 60-70% responded it was highly likely to be an actual cause. when it came to racism, on the other hand, only 30% believed racism to be a likely cause. with racism and social justice being prevalent in the media right now, one would think that others would say racism to be the cause of a disproportion of cases and deaths for minorities. furthermore, on the cdc’s website, it is stated that racism is the leading cause of a disproportion between minorities but this thought was not reflected in the survey.","covid-19, ann arbor, michigan",,"takiyah ali michigan islamic academy ann arbor, michigan, usa",
306,Examination Of Supply Chain Challenges In Large Scale  Exterior Building Panels From The Perspective Of An Eto,"finding the appropriate balance for engineer-to-order (eto) prefabrication firms between work in process (wip), finished goods inventory, buffer hedging, transportation time and the field installation consumption rate is difficult to determine. the difficulty arises due to the high degree of variability in the product offerings to meet the architectural and performance requirements of different projects and locations where the products will be delivered and installed. variability also exists in plant production rates, on-site equipment availability, and efficiency of on-site installation crew. this paper examines these challenges of eto panel fabricators and evaluates potential applicable solutions. in addition to the analysis for a single firm, a survey of firms performing similar work spread across the continental us was conducted to gauge their respective solutions to similar problems. the majority of the respondents plan to commence fabrication in advance of field operations and half of the respondents have experienced situations where they had to slow or halt production of the panel products due to storage constraints.","prefabrication, construction, eto, supply chain",The results of the survey confirmed that ETO panel fabricators all believe that they must commence fabrication and have a large portion of the project in finished goods inventory prior the installation process starting. The majority of the panel fabricators store their finished goods inventory on trailers at their facility. Half of the respondents stated they have had to slow or stop their production line because of storage constraints of finished goods inventories. This finding is substantial and undoubtedly shows that there is a cost impact for the forced shutdown or slow down to not run out of space. The findings stress the need for an ETO panel fabricator to develop a plan or method for address storage related issues of finished goods inventory such as an off-site storage facility while being mindful of the costs associated with trailer usage and availability. The detailed investigation of a Michigan-based ETO panel fabricator’s preceding projects utilizing the Centroid Method to determine a location for off-site storage resulted in a reasonable determination.

In order to attain a good detection, a total number of 611 images including some repeated images of the waste material all four category considered were sampled. This was compiled to achieve an extensive dataset of about 2,444 images in total. The dataset comprised of images augmented into different angles to increase diversity to suit real time testing conditions. On the other hand, the prospects and barriers of waste to energy researched on, indicated that socio-economic gains, jobs, tourism, technological advancements, environmental cleanliness and reduction of communicable diseases are the prospects of generating energy from waste plants in Ghana. Also, insufficient Infrastructure, lack of technical education on modern approach and methods of proper waste management, improper implementation of policies and politics are the challenges of waste to energy generation in Ghana.","ruhiya abubakar department of electrical/electronic engineering, ghana technology university college accra, ghana rabubakar@gtuc.edu.gh, k.m sharath kumar department of management studies, m. s. ramaiah school of advanced studies, bangalore, dd.sr@msruas.ac.in amevi acakpovi department electrical/electronic engineering, accra technical university, accra, ghana acakpovia@gmail.com ussif william ayinga reform secretariat, ministry of education, accra, ghana ayiinga@yahoo.com nana agyeman prempeh department of procurement and marketing, ghana technology university college nagyeman-prempeh@gtuc.edu.gh jeremiah tetteh, ethel seyram kumassah* department of telecommunications engineering, ghana technology university college tettehjeremiah04@gmail.com, seyerthy@gmail.com*",

313,Undergraduate Engineering Education During Covid-19,"undergraduate engineering education methodology has remained largely unchanged at universities for many decades, if not centuries. apart from computer technology, not much has changed for at least the last century. the sudden appearance of covid-19 forced all tertiary institutions across the world to drastically change the way they present courses to their students almost overnight. due to the highly infectious nature of the pandemic, it was evident that courses needed to be delivered online. while study programmes such as some business and social sciences programmes were very successful in transitioning to an online delivery mode, engineering and other science-based programmes encountered additional challenges, both in terms of delivery as well as the way assessments are conducted.","engineering, online education","The appearance of COVID-19 has forced all universities to venture into online teaching. Many universities, and in Africa, one could probably say most universities, had no prior experience with online remote teaching. As a result, these universities had to rethink their teaching and lecturing delivery style quite substantially. Numerous problems faced African universities in general during this time, however, the delivery of courses and the fair and proper assessment of students remained large obstacles. This paper aims to provide some approaches that may be taken to overcome some of these obstacles without having to spend large sums of money. It is concluded that it is indeed possible to provide quality education and teach and assess engineering students without spending large sums of money. The authors want to recognise our colleagues within the Faculty who have contributed to making a success of online teaching during this COVID-19 transition period.","johannes p van der walt faculty of engineering namibia university of science and technology windhoek, namibia jvanderwalt@nust.na e bernard j siepker department of mechanical and marine engineering namibia university of science and technology windhoek, namibia bsiepker@nust.na",
314,Enhanced The Performance Of Diesel Fuel Blended With  Palm Kernel Oil For Diesel Engine,"this study focus on enhancing the iraqi diesel fuel with palm kernel biodiesel. palm kernel biodiesel was prepared by transesterification process using methanol and sodium hydroxide (naoh) as catalyst. the performance evaluation and emissions of inline four cylinders, four strokes, direct injection diesel engine. the engine operated with palm kernel biodiesel (100% biodiesel) and its blends with diesel fuel for the ratios (20% palm kernel biodiesel with 80% diesel) and (50% palm kernel biodiesel with 50% diesel) and compared with pure diesel fuel (100% diesel).the tests carried out at constant speed of (1500 rpm) with variable loads (5, 10, 15, 20 and 25). the results show reduction in bsfc when using b20 and b50 blend ratio. the maximum reduction was at b20 by about (8.28%) compared to diesel fuel. the same blend gives higher thermal efficiency by about (12.11%). the increasing biodiesel blend ratio led to reduce the exhaust gas emissions for co2, and so2 were (47.51%), and (97.20%) respectively. however, nox emissions showed at b100 increased by 7.10% with the increasing of biodiesel blend ratio.","palm kernel oil, engine performance","This paper prepared biodiesel from palm kernel oil for diesel engine as alternative fuel without any engine modifications. The reduction in brake specific fuel consumption for biodiesel blends about (8.28%) for blend B20 and (2.88%) for blend B50, but increased at B100 by about (16.18%) compared with biodiesel. The thermal efficiency of blend B20 is higher than diesel by about (12.11%) followed by B50 by about (11.18%), but in B100 thermal efficiency is reduced by about (1.83%). There is significant reduction of exhaust gas emissions in (CO2 and SO2) with the increasing of all biodiesel percentages as compared to the diesel fuel. Maximum reduction of these gasses emissions was found at B100 by (47.51%), and (97.20%) respectively. The NOx emission shows slight increase with the increasing of biodiesel blend ratio. The maximum increasing found at B100 by about (7.10%). The results show the possibility of the use of palm kernel biodiesel blends with diesel fuel which improves engine performance by reduces the amount of brake specific fuel consumption and reduces the amount of toxic emissions. The palm kernel biodiesel considered environmentally friendly fuel and improve the impact on human health and the environment.","salah k. jawad, mohammed m. hamadi and batool h. kafi department of production engineering and metallurgy university of technology baghdad, iraq 70001@uotechnology.edu.iq , aya_drhmm@yahoo.com, batool.kafi86@yahoo.com",

318,The Spatial-Sir Model For Covid-19 Transmission By  Resampling Method To Selecting Parameter,"the current outbreak of coronavirus disease (covid-19) has become a global issue to its quick and widespread over the world, including in indonesia. more than 60% of positive cases came from java island, therefore the proposed model focused on six provinces in this area. we developed a discrete-time stochastic epidemic model, such as spatial- sird model, associated with the mobility of people by public transportation (air and land). model parameters were estimated by fitting the data of october 22nd – 28th, 2020 and november 8th-november 14th, 2020 with the model. at the beginning of the estimation process, we used the coefficient of regression from the observation to estimate the range of parameters. afterward, the order statistics method was carried out to determine the best parameters so we could forecast the number of infectious of each province. the sir model was created by applying the regression rate proceedings of the 2nd african international conference on industrial engineering and operations management harare, zimbabwe, december 7-10, 2020 © ieom society international 3099",,"This model aims to obtain an overview of the condition of each province in the case of Covid-19 desease spread in the future. One of the factors that can influence the condition of the case is the long vacation which causes an increase in the intensity of population mobilization and interaction. This could obstruct the government efforts to break the chain of COVID-19 spreading. Through this simulation, a comparison of the parameters before and after the long weekend on October 28th - November 1st, 2020 is obtained. The result of the simulation - with 𝑀𝑀𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 = 1000, n = 10 repetitions, and the distribution of the parameters depicted in Table 2 - shows that there has been a society behavior change during these two periods. The average of percentage error of the estimation results of the two periods is only 0.3% difference. Therefore, the resampling method in the Spatial-SIR model is sufficient to provide the desired description.

319,Modified Verhulst Logistic Growth Model Applied To  Covid-19 Data In Indonesia As One Example Of Model,"the verhulst logistic function is among the most popular function to describe a growth phenomenon. initially the theory is applied in studying the growth of living organism populations. however now it finds the applications in any growth phenomenon, including social, education, and engineering. there is a huge number of applications of the logistic function in various field. one of the strength of the model is its capability in estimating the carrying capacity or the maximum level of the growth. this upper bound is very important to obtain and has many practical implication. however, in some circumstances the function may fail to estimate this upper bound, especially when the growth is still at the beginning phase. in pedagogical context of mathematical modeling this failure is regarded as a good example in explaining the modeling process, in which when a model fails to comply with the reality, one should proceed to refine the model following the full cycle of modeling process. in this paper we present a modified growth model of the verhulst logistic function, since when it is applied to the covid-19 pandemic data in indonesia, it cannot estimate the carrying capacity satisfactory. the modification has improved the estimation performance in terms of the root of the mean square error measure (rmse).","covid-19 pandemic, empirical model, indonesia","We modeled the pandemic data of Indonesia (the total/cumulative confirmed cases data) from the Worldometer website (Worldometer 2020) using two growth functions: the original logistic function and the modified logistic function. The results show that the logistic function fails to estimate the carrying capacity K of the total confirmed cases data. The model shows that, in terms of total confirmed cases pandemic data of Indonesia, at this date the disease should have already reached the carrying capacity K, which is in fact untrue. The inaccuracy becomes apparent when we plot the daily new cases which clearly depart form the observed data. Meanwhile, the results also show that the modified logistic equation is able to estimate the carrying capacity Kα of the total confirmed cases and produces curve that satisfactorily fits the data. However if we look at the result for the daily new cases, the model also shows that at this date the disease should have already reached the carrying capacity Kα, which is also untrue. This concludes that while the modified logistic model is able to mimic the total confirmed cases data, it still fails to fit the daily new cases data. Further refinement of the model still need to be done. This is currently under investigation. There is some reasons why the logistic growth model does not fit for COVID-19 data. One of them is when it is applied too early in which the disease still in the exponential growth phase, such as in the case of Indonesia COVID-19 data Proceedings of the 2nd African International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management Harare, Zimbabwe, December 7-10, 2020","refinement in teaching mathematical modeling hennie husniah department of industrial engineering langlangbuana university bandung, 40116, indonesia hennie.husniah@gmail.com asep k. supriatna department of mathematics padjadjaran university jatinangor, 45363, indonesia aksupriatna@gmail.com","References

320,Can Convalescent Plasma Transfusion Reduce The  Covid19 Transmission?,"with no vaccine available on the market, handling the covid-19 pandemic is still a difficult problem to do. preventive actions, such as wearing masks, distance guarding, frequent hand washing, and others are still the most important interventions in handling the transmission of this disease. apart from disease transmission, the mortality rate is also an issue that has been widely studied in order to reduce its intensity. so far several countries have allowed the use of convalescent plasma transfusion (cpt) in the management of moderate and severe covid-19 patients. although this method is a fairly old method and is often used for other diseases, so far there have not been many studies on the impact of using cpt for covid-19 on the population level. several early studies of this use have yielded prospective results with reduced mortality rates. in this paper, we show by using a simple discrete mathematical model, that the uses of cpt for covid-19 patients can also reduce the outbreak, in the sense of reducing the peak number of active cases and the length of the outbreak itself. the model used is the simplest discrete sir and seir models. the completion of the model is done numerically through simulation on a spreadsheet to obtain general insight regarding the effect of the cpt application in covid-19 management.","pandemic covid-19, sir, seir, discrete equations","We have presented a simple discrete time version of SIR and SEIR epidemic models with the effect of the convalescent plasma transfusion (CPT). The models revealed both the SIR and SEIR models predict that the use of CPT is indeed prospective in reducing the number infection. In this case it could decreases the peak of the outbreak as well as the length of the epidemic period. With the progress on the clinical investigation of the use of CPT in COVID-19, related data may soon available and further refinement and parameterization of the model should be done to obtain prudent insight of the model prediction.

321,Two-Dimensional Maintenance Service Contract  Ensuring Availability Using Non-Periodic Imperfect,this paper deals with a two-dimensional maintenance service contract (msc) characterized by time and usage limits. we consider that an agent offers the two dimensional msc and promises a high availability of the equipment. the subsequent preventive maintenance (pm) actions are carried out to ensure the availability target. the optimal non- periodic pm policy is obtained to maximize the availability. numerical examples are presented to illustrate the subsequent pm intervals meeting the availability target.,"two-dimensional, availability","In this paper we study 2-D MSC that ensuring availability using a sequential imperfect PM. The algorithm is proposed to obtain the best value of decision variable, 𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖 and its corresponding availability (𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖). Numerical results show that the proposed model is better for the case of moderate to severe conditions. The algorithm developed does not give the optimal solution – it is only the suboptimal solution, and hence the optimal method based the dynamic programming formulation is a challenging further research topic. Also, one needs to consider the total cost of maintenance as well as the availability to find the best PM policy, and this is another interesting topic for further research.

323,English Teaching Techniques And Media Used In Indonesian   Islamic Junior High Schools,"this study aims at describing the teaching english teaching techniques and media used in indonesian islamic junior high schools. the research is a descriptive qualitative study. the data was collected by using some instruments, namely observation sheets, documentation, field notes, and interview guide with the english teacher as well as students of eighth grades. the findings that the english teacher used warm up, setting, organizational, content explanation, role play demonstration, checking, question answer display, translation, dictation, copying, identification, recognition, review and testing, which are included in controlled techniques. then, information transfer, information exchange, wrap up and preparation in semi-controlled techniques. next, role play, interview and discussion were included in free techniques. meanwhile, teaching media that were used by the english teacher were pictures about unique house and white board, which was included in visual and projected media. next, textbook and english dictionary for printed media; then, role play as games media. the interviews with the students reveals that the teaching techniques and teaching media that were used by the english teacher were very interesting and suitable with the material in the textbook. moreover, the interaction between the teacher and the students in the classroom was very attractive during the english lesson.",media,"is about the teaching media that was used by the English teacher in teaching English lesson for the eighth-grade students. The researcher explained in discussion of the previous chapter that the various teaching media that were used by the English teacher are pictures of the unique house and white board as a visual and projected media, text book and dictionary as printed media, then role play as games media. Those are included within traditional media. The teaching media that were used by the English teacher in teaching eighth graders were really exciting. The media can engage the students to enjoy the class and be conducive during the English lesson. Moreover, the teaching media is appropriate for the material within the textbook because the English teacher used the teaching media as the representative of the material that will be delivered by the English teacher at the end of the lesson. 5.4 Future Research There are also several weaknesses of this study, such as the plenty amount of the students in the classroom because, for a class, there are approximately thirty students within classroom. But on the contrary, as stated by the English teacher, normal English class only consists of up to ten to fifteen students in the classroom. Another weakness is how the students would disturb other students to make noise and chaos in the classroom after finishing their assignments. It would be better if the students who already finished their assignment to go back, sit down and keep silent until end of the class.","sugeng susilo adi department of language education, faculty of cultural studies, universitas brawijaya, indonesia sugengadi@ub.ac.id tri hadiyanti hayuningrum hartono alumnae of the department of language education, universitas brawijaya, indonesia hadiyantitri3@gmail.com lusy tunik muharlisiani department of english education, faculty of language and sciences, universitas wijaya kusuma surabaya, indonesia lusytm_fbs@uwks.ac.id johny sugiono department of english education, faculty of language and sciences, universitas wijaya kusuma surabaya, indonesia johnysugiono_fbs@uwks.ac.id",

This is caused by two things namely the substance of criminal or civil sanctions of copyright regulations and low knowledge of the authority about copyright. Substantially, criminal and civil penalties, the copyright law state the longest penalty for criminal sanctions and at most for civil sanctions. Although substantially these sanctions are the same as copyright laws in Singapore and Malaysia, but the authorities of both countries are more proactive and coordinative in cracking down on copyright infringement. The proofwas from the result of a heavier copyright infringement judgment, when compared to the judgment of courts in Indonesia, especially in Batam. The lack of knowledge and coordination of the authority in Indonesiais not to be optimal in the role of civilian government investigator who assisted the police in investigating VCDs and pirated DVDs.

325,Food Safety And Its Regulation On School Snacks For  Society'S Health In Cirebon,"food safety is the right of each person, with no exception of students who are in growth, and their body has vunerable immunity to diseases. one of the causes of those diseases is consuming pattern of buying snacks recklessly and become students' habit, and the serving of the snacks make it easy for food having a contact with microba as one of the causes of various diseases. besides that, school snacks as products dominated by home industry, are assumed to have risk for health, this is caused by unhealthy food condition, the use of unclean tools for producing food, unhealthy producer, food contminated by bacteria, to the use of raw material and additives, and other dangerous substances that affect the quality and safety of the food that should be avoided to be consumed. that social reality becomes the attention in the study that is meant to review and study the implementation of regulation policy of school snacks safety in cirebon. the approach method used in this study is normative juridical-- -empirical, it means that law as applied law research, which is legal study about law/regulation implementation vertically and horizontally related to food safety regulation, and in action, law is in every legal event occured in society. legal tool about food safety management as the base of policy making and to prevent school snacks unsafety substantially is enough, but in cirebon technical regulation in the form of regional regulation on school snacks management has not been made yet, and on its application level, there is obstacle such as legal awareness and legal obidience of society to legal norm implementation.","food safety, legal norms","Cirebon government has not made technical regulation in the form of Regional Regulation on school snacks. That regulation is important to make because there are many snacks contain dangerous food additives such as rhodamin, formalin, borax that can cause poisoning, diarrhea and cancer on students. Food package that is not suitable with food package regulation and from school canteen hygiene is not enough. That social reality needs legal norm that can be used to manage and prevent possibility that endanger student’s health. 6. Suggestion 1.

326,Enhancing Students’ Awareness On Cross-Cultural  Understanding Course Through Lesson Study,"lesson study was first introduced during the indonesian mathematics and science education (mipa). recently, it has been developed in some other courses at ummu ternate such as at department of education of primary school teacher, department of public health, and especially at english department in cross-cultural understanding course. students’ awareness on local culture, national, domestic, and international first was not too easy to apply in the learning process, especially in individual interacting among students and teacher related to the material. to overcome these problems, it needs to implement the lesson study that includes 3 stages: planning (plan), implementation (do), and reflection (see). the goal of this lesson study in this course is to enhance students’ cultural awareness in-group discussion, improve the quality of teaching and learning, and build the pathways for ongoing improvement of instruction. this qualitative research was conducted in 4 cycles with its object was the fifth semester students consisting of 25 people. after reflection (see), the results found that students were actively participated and though insightfully to explore the ideas about the culture of what they met in their daily life through group discussion. besides, teachers’ pathways in instruction had changed from being teacher center to be student center.","enhancing, cultural awareness","After implemented lesson study as classroom instruction, students’ behaviors that support student engagement are likely to contribute to both positive attitudes about the class and to enhanced learning. In particular, student perceptions in the lesson immediately, “present,” or significant to the interaction help establish the cultural awareness in which students attend to one another, share ideas, more tolerance, trust one another, and collaborate. Moreover, the vast majority of students’ awareness was immediately enhanced in their triads, discussing the potential focus and clearly appreciating the opportunity to discuss the lesson with their group members. This research shows that teacher of CCU was able to engage in the inquiry process of lesson study and successfully bring about change in his practice that addressed the individual learning needs of the students. In addition, the essential of lesson study has changed the college teachers’ pedagogical thinking and practices because it becomes the most effective way to improve teaching would be for teachers to develop further the culture of sharing and working together. Its essential is also found as the power of collaboration that focused on the classroom and the learning of students. Furthermore, there was an overwhelming positive reaction to the opportunities that lesson study was providing for many teachers. The positive outcome that it could use to encourage teachers in our community to engage in research as there needed to be a tangible outcome for them which they could relate to in terms of their own development. This research lesson is a continued need for further implementation and future research on the lesson study model. Implementing lesson study in Indonesia not as an educational project that is supported from ministry of education and culture, but this teaching and learning practice could be continue as the independent practice that should be applied in the Principe of Total Quality Management, which is to improve the quality of learners learning and teachers teaching (Ahmad & Gay, 2012). Darling-Hammond (2003) confirms repeatedly in her work “creating a profession of teaching in which teachers have the opportunity for continual learning is the likeliest way to inspire greater achievement for children” (p. 281).

327,Analysis Of The Role Of Financial Technology Insupporting  The Financial Inclusion Program,"the availability of banking services and payments to the entire population without discrimination is the main objective of the policy of financial inclusion. many financial technology-based innovations are emerging in the future to improve financial inclusion. the purpose of this study is to encourage the level of achievement of financial inclusion programs through the most effective and transparent financial services. in this study discusses various financial technological innovations used to reach rural communities and conceptual models are developed to identify the factors that drive financial inclusion. the results of the study developed through literature research identified that the level of financial literacy, high cost, technology, trust, income level, distance, and product, is the determining factor of financial inclusion in rural areas.",financial inclusion,and recommendations Technological innovation and communication technology support play an important role in supporting the development of financial technology necessary to strengthen the role of financial inclusion. Increased financial inclusion significantly has a significant correlation and influence on poverty alleviation and reduced income inequality. The results of this conclusion provide a framework for stakeholders to strengthen the role of financial inclusion in rural communities and low-income communities. The suggestion of this research is the need for further research through field research with primary data collection to produce more in-depth quantitative research. While the framework in this study can be followed up through more in-depth field research.,"fahruddin salim universitas pancasila, jakarta fahruddinsalim@univpancasila.ac.id, contact person: 082122390081",
328,An Analysis Of Finance Of Regional Government Of North  Halmahera Regency For 2009-2014 Budget Year,"regional autonomy is defined as the granting of authority and obligations by the central government to regional administrators to regulate and manage government affairs and community interests on their own accord based on the aspirations of the community in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. the policy of fiscal autonomy and decentralization is an answer to the demands of the people who expect a change in all aspects of the life of the nation and state, where one of the important aspects of the implementation of regional autonomy that must be managed carefully is the problem of regional financial management and regional budgets. to realize broad, real and accountable regional autonomy, it is necessary to have regional financial management that is able to control regional financial policies economically, efficiently, effectively, transparently and accountably. this research was conducted in june 2016 in the office of regional finance and asset management board of north halmahera regency government, aiming at analyzing the financial performance of north halmahera regency government for the last five years (2009-2014). the research finds that (1) the region’s mean financial performance is unstable; (2) several financial ratios still show positive and negative trends; (3) the regional financial independence level has not been stable since it still to some extent depends on external sources of fund, particularly from the central government; and (4) the performance of north halmahera regency government has not been effective since its effectiveness and efficiency rations have not been 1 (one) or 100 percent.","financial analysis, north halmahera","Financial ratio analysis is a tool that can be used to assess the performance of local governments in regional financial management as outlined in the APBD. Based on the analysis results discussed earlier, the financial performance of the North Halmahera district government shows that the average regional financial performance is still unstable. The results of calculations in each year still experience fluctuating numbers so that some financial ratios still show positive and negative trends. For the ratio of financial independence of the North Halmahera regency government up to 2014 shows the level of regional financial independence that has not been stable because there is still dependence on funding sources from external parties, especially the central government. Based on the results of calculations for the effectiveness and efficiency ratio, it shows that the performance of the North Halmahera district government has not been effective because the ratio of effectiveness and efficiency has not reached 1 (one) or 100 percent. In the measurement of the activity ratio, it can be seen that most of the funds owned by the government after the implementation of the regional autonomy policy are still prioritized for meeting routine expenditures, so the ratio of public development spending to APBD is still relatively small.","muhammad iqra harun1 lecturer at economy faculty ummu-ternate, indonesia m_iqraharun@gmail.com",

Street). On Port road after installing Speed Bump service level (LOS) F, the influence of Speed Bump makes the driver reduce speed, free flow velocity in the area no Speed Bump Vfree = 29,424 km / h, while in the free bed police area = 5,147 km / h, the maximum flow in the area is no Speed Bump Fmak. = 8.112 vehicles / hour, while in the Speed Bump Fmak. = 1.157 vehicles / hour. There is a maximum flow in the Speed Bump area. The installation of Speed Bumps should be followed by the installation of signs or signs indicating the existence of Speed Bumps on the port road, so that their presence does not surprise passing road users. It is necessary to do further research on the analysis of Speed Bumps on speed, in order to obtain the factors that influence the speed at Speed Bumps and ideally the interval distance between installed Speed Bumps. when passing Speed Bumps which have been installed in port.

With the infradiscipline it can be drawn to the thread that law has some convergence, since both embrace the positiveness, mere peculiarity and axiology, the law can be established with a real moral norm based on an empathetic attitude that implies beyond the principles of justice. In addition, psychologically it can be argued that the biological nature of man is a stepping stone in every case to define the overall purpose of the law. Besides the nature of human biology is the source of sociolitas, the psychic attachment, which makes the emotional union of the individual into a possible group. However, in the specific elaboration of human biology we can see from the beginning of space and time in building legal awareness in interacting generally and online specifically. In the life of the nation and the state of the legal consciousness of the Indonesian nation has been thinned from the nature, personality and identity of the Indonesian nation. The depletion of legal awareness of the Indonesian nation is influenced by internal and external factors. The internal faculty deals with the empathy and the understanding of the Indonesian nation in carrying out the law, while the external factor is related to the development of information and technology, the ideas or the influence of thought from the foreign culture so quickly absorbed by society. The condition of legal awareness in Indonesia is one of the factor that resulted in the state of life of the nation and state is mentally ill, because the metobolism of public legal consciousness is being disturbed, according to the author of legal awareness is one of the elements in the process of law development that is very influential, as well as in law enforcement. The formation of law and law enforcement is a manifestation of the development of legal awareness, it can be said that the legal awareness of the law will be negative in the process of law development. Based on the above conclusions, the things that need to be suggested are as follows: First, Need to improve the model of higher education law that has only studied the law alone, now and in the future need sociological and psychological approach with emphasis on increased legal awareness. Second, the establishment of legislation refers to the soiological and philosophical values that underlie the life of the people of the archipelago, so that the people do notapathetic in the implementation of legislation.","rakhmat nopliardy and nurul listyani faculty of law, university of islam kalimantan (uniska) muhammad arsyad al banjari banjarmasin email of the coressponding author:rakhmat_nopliardy@uniska-bjm.ac.id",

343,Soil Stabilization Using Gypsum And The Effect Based On  The Unconfined Compressve Strength Values,"the process of soil stabilization refers to changing the physical properties of soil in order to improve its strength, durability, or other qualities. typically, this is important for road construction, and other concerns related to the building and maintenance of infrastructure. soil that has been stabilized will have a vastly improved bearing capacity, and will also be significantly more resistant to being damaged by water, frost, or inclement conditions soil). this research briefly describes the suitability of the gypsum to be used in the stabilized soil. unconfined compressive strength (ucs) used as indicator to the strength development and hence evaluating the performance of gypsum stabilized soil. this research focusing on the effect of gypsum as a soil stabilizer. a various mix design at different percentage of gypsum (0, 4%, 8%, 10% and 15%) were prepared and cured for 0, 7, 14 21 and 28 days. then the unconfined compressive strength (ucs) was carried out on 38mm diameter x 76mm height specimens. the lowest unconfined compressive strength test results were found in the gypsum content of 0% and curing for 0 days of 3.8667 kg / cm2. while, the largest found in the gypsum content of 8% with 28 days of 14.2 kg / cm2. curing increases the strength of soil. the addition of gypsum is effective for stabilization of clay soil.","soil stabilization, gypsum, clay soil, atterberg limits","The results of clay and clay soil testing with gypsum with a percentage of 0%, 4%, 8%, 10% and 15% with curing for 0 days, 7 days, 14 days, 21 days, and 28 days can be concluded as follows: - Based on the results the original soil samples taken on the road of Mangkualam Village, Cimanggu District, Pandeglang Regency. The liquid limit (LL) is 62.4% and the plastic limit (PL): 44.82. According to unified soil classification system, the soil was classified as clays with high development potential. Whereas, for the soil stabilization with gypsum addition of 0%, 4%, 8%, 10% and 15% with curing time of 0 days, 7 days, 14 days, 21 days, and 28 days, it shows that the LL values have decreased with increase in the percentage of gypsum. The liquid limit value shows a decrease. - Based on the results of the specific gravity test (Gs), there was an increase from Gypsum levels 0% with Gs 2.547 to 2.646 for Gypsum levels 15%. - The lowest unconfined compressive strength test results were found in the gypsum content of 0% and curing for 0 days of 3.8667 kg / cm2. While, the largest found in the gypsum content of 8% with 28 days of 14.2 kg / cm2. Curing increases the strength of soil. The addition of the percentage of gypsum increases the soil strength, but there is a maximum point, if too many specimens dry out, the soil strength will decrease. - Thus, it can be concluded in general that the percentage of gypsum mixture which is effective for the stabilization of clay soil in Mangkualam Village, Cimanggu District-Pandeglang Regency is the addition of gypsum by 8% with curing time of 28 days.","syafiadi rizki abdila school of materials engineering, university malaysia perlis, malaysia rizkisyafiadi@gmail.com syafwandi, muhammad isradi, mohamad sobirin and acep hidayat faculty of engineering, univeristy mercu buana jakarta, indonesia h.syafwandi13@gmail.com, isradi@mercubuana.ac.id, sobirinmkj2018@gmail.com, acephidayat1975@gmail.com",

346,The General Principles Of Good Governance In Indonesia,"there are several stages before the birth of the welfare state concept, some authors mention the following stages, namely police state (polizei staat), formal law state (liberal), the materiel law state (welvaarstaat/welfare state). type of police state and the welfare state referred to as the extreme form of law state, because the police state is regarded as an early form of law state, while the welfare state is a type of law state is considered applicable today, being the general principles of good governance born during the development of the welfare state. general principles of good governance, they are rarely found. the first term may be found in presidential decree number 15 of 1983, indonesian act number 28 of 1999, indonesian act number 9 of 2004, indonesian act number 25 of 2009, and indonesian act number 30 of 2014.",the law system,"There are stages of development of civilization to arrive at the concept of a modern constitutional state, namely: 1 / Police State (polizei taat); 2/Night Guard State (nachwakerstaat); 3 / Welfare State (welvaarstaat). Their freedom of action (Freis ermessen) for reasons of public services (bestuurzorg) that do officials of state administration in the countries are welfare, then there are growing concerns in the Netherlands regarding the lack of protection of the public for the actions of officials of the State administration who perform unlawful acts (onrechmatig overheidsdaad), abuse of authority (detournement de pouvoir), and arbitrary (willeker / abus de droit), then in 1946 was led by de Monchy duty to think about and examine several alternatives of enhanced legal protection for the people of the state administration actions that deviate (Verhoogde Rechtsbescherming). In 1950 the Commission de Monchy then report the results of research on verhoogde rechtscherming in the form of ""Algemene beginselen van behoorlijk bestuur"" which translates to the general principles of good government. The results of the study commission is not fully approved by the government or there are some things that cause disagreements between commission de Monchy with the government, which led to the commission was disbanded by the government. Then came the commissions van de Greenten, which was also formed by the government with the same task with the de Monchy, but the second commission have also suffered the same fate, namely because there are several opinions obtained from the research was not approved by the government, and the commission even this was dissolved without producing results. General Principles of Good Government in Indonesia is now accepted not only as a legal opinion of experts (doctrine) or court decisions that have permanent legal force, but already masuh in written law, as in Indonesian Act Number 28 of 1999 on the state operating in clean and Free from corruption, collusion and nepotism, and also can be found in the explanation of article 53 paragraph 2 letter b Indonesian Act Number 9 of 2004, concerning the Amendment to Indonesian Act Number 5 of 1986 on Administrative Courts Country. In Article 4 of Indonesian Act Number 25 of 2009 on Public Service, and Article 10 of Indonesian Act Number 30 of 2014 concerning Government Administration, which states expressly with the term of Good Governance Principle.","m. zamroni, aang kunaifi, agung supangkat, rahayu sri utami, siti mundiroh, bambang panji gunawan, suyatno, sudjiono, mudjib departement of law universitas maarif hasyim latif sidoarjo, indonesia zamroni@dosen.umaha.ac.id, aangkunaifi@dosen.umaha.ac.id, agung.supangkat@dosen.umaha.ac.id, ayu_utami@dosen.umaha.ac.id, siti_mundiroh@dosen.umaha.ac.id, bambang.panji@dosen.umaha.ac.id, suyatno@dosen.umaha.ac.id, sudjiono@dosen.umaha.ac.id, mudjib@dosen.umaha.ac.id achmad fathoni rodli department of economics and business universitas maarif hasyim latif sidoarjo, indonesia fathoni_rodli@dosen.umaha.ac.id ahmad makki yayasan pendidikan dan sosial maarif sepanjang, sidoarjo, indonesia rm_makki@yahoo.co.id",

It also helped to render a strategic plan to raise revenue and create market recognition, advertising is the most critical aspect that allows every product or service to lift brand recognition, due to lack of awareness and promotion in the market Areca tea had lost its presence identity in the market area later when new initiatives were taken to expose it into the market, customers showed real interest in purchasing the product and also appreciated it. Understanding the demographics of the consumer, their affordability, their needs, wants, preferences, priorities are necessity and need of the hour, which can help us to succeed in the market and reach out the right customer at the right time in the given situation and still compete with other alternative or supplement products. It also helps in client retainment by providing a high service to consumer. As the working folks, students, housewives, senior citizens etc. consider coffee and tea as a stimulating, driving boosters which makes them actively perform their daily routines and it also acts as a refreshing agent similarly even Area tea is placed in a market not just as a refresher or booster but also as a health drink meant for maintaining their physique as well as a healthy lifestyle. 11.","sales and spread brand awareness for areca market in karnataka, india” divya bharathi research scholar, dept. of management studies, ballari institute of technology and management, visveswaraya technological university – karnataka, india mobile: 8951810996, mail: divyaammu82@gmail.com dr g. p. dinesh professor & chairman, doms, vijayanagara sri krishnadevaraya university - karnataka, india mobile: 9880779387, mail: gurrumdinesh@gmail.com",
351,Applying Project And Programme Management Principles To  The Manufacturing Competitiveness Enhancement,"the manufacturing competitiveness enhancement programme (mcep) scheme was specifically designed and developed in order to incentivise industry with various components, ranging from capital investment, green technology, and enterprise level of competitiveness. during the tenure of the incentive programme, there were challenges pertaining to over-commitment, poor turnaround times, and poor customer service management and customer relations management leading to poor project and programme management. these challenges resulted into long turnaround times and over-commitment. there was a lack of a logical relationship between the scheduling and budgetary and scoping analysis, thereby impacting adversely on the industrialists and the economy at large. the study was conducted on how the application of project and programme management could ameliorate the challenges incurred by the scheme. based on the outcome of the study, there was a general agreement that there was a dearth of project and programme management in the mcep, and its implementation which would ultimately resolve the inefficiencies in the programme. the study concluded that it is important to designed and developed a programme in order to incentivise the manufacturing industry in south africa, the core objective of which is to embrace competitiveness enhancement, global competitiveness and export-driven economy, as well as to protect industry during turbulent and volatile economic conditions.","manufacturing, industrialisation, project management","In light of the research question of the study, which enquired how the MCEP programme can be successfully managed, measured, monitored and appraised, the findings of the research ascertained that project and programme management principles, along with methodologies, in collaboration with economic theories and practices, monitoring and evaluation systems be adopted by the programme and future incentive programmes. This will provide an efficient and effective MCEP incentive programme, thereby ameliorating the backlog, over- commitment, and project constraint synchronisation challenges, and, furthermore, be an enabler of improved benefits realisation management and economic impact analysis.

352,Life Cycle Assessment Of Ordinary Portland Cement (Opc)  Using Problem Oriented (Midpoint) Approach.,"the environmental impact of the cement production has been beckoning for attention in recent time. different literatures have different things to say on these environmental impacts, at different production phase. this study applied life cycle assessment (lca) evaluation tool to evaluate ordinary portland cement (opc) in establishing the environmental implication of cement production using the midpoint approach of lcia method. result of assessment shows that clinker production phase has the highest contribution to global warming which brings about climatic change due to high co2 emission which affects both human health and ecosystem. crude oil, coal and natural gas are expended maximally to bring about fossil resource scarcity and terrestrial toxicity, which affects both human and ecosystem because of high copper deposited from the clinker production phase alongside other phases of production.","lca, lcia","The analysis was done on 1kg of OPC. Global Warming brings about climate change, which affects both human health and ecosystem. Note that whatsoever affects ecosystem will of surety affect human beings general. The effect of global warming therefore has major effect on human being. GW is as a result of 97.1% of CO2 emission and 85.6% or this emission is from the clinker production stage. This is in-line with literature and particularly with Meyer’s submission in his work that almost 1ton of cement produced emits almost 1 ton of CO2. However, kilogram is the unit of measure used in this study. As seen above, Fossil resource scarcity results to unavailability of fuel resources such as crude oil (43.7%), coal energy (43.21%) and natural gas (13.1%) of 0.083kg (mineral resource scarcity and fossil resource scarcity) for every 1kg of OPC produced. The unavailability of resources thereby increases the cost of the available ones. In addition, Terrestrial ecotoxicity affects both human health and ecosystem as 61.5% of 0.438kg of this impact is from copper deposited at clinker production phase and other phases. This study concluded that 0.91kg of CO2 is emitted for every 1kg of OPC produced and 0.756kg of this 0.91kg is from the calcination process alone. Global warming has the highest impact and makes the most prominent environmental impact of the cement industry. This therefore calls for attention as the effect of impact is seen in changes in climatic condition which affects both human and ecosystem. The calcination phase is the highest contributor because of the chemical decomposition of CaCO3. One of the ways to reduce CO2 emission in this phase is to reduce the amount of clinker and replace it with other supplementary cement materials like natural pozzolana: fly ash, slag, etc.","1busola dorcas olagunju, 2oludolapo akanni olanrewaju department of industrial engineering faculty of engineering and the built environment durban university of technology, durban, sa 122063722@dut4life.ac.za, 2oludolapoo@dut.ac.za",

A cluster of AIIRs was used as a case study and we were able to reduce the exposure of a human resource to an infectious environment by substituting the human sensor and tactile sensors with an automated system for remote plant diagnosis. The change over of a room from Positive to negative pressure could also be done remotely which then frees up resources of having to use a human resource. The study also provided valuable information and data which was used to fine-tune the plant and improve overall performance and energy consumption. We were able to compare electrical data gathered from various power meters and power analyzers. Data from this study was also used to better understand the realistic uninterrupted power requirements and draw a comparison against the calculated data. We were also able to use Raspberry pi technology to substitute otherwise expensive controllers and provide a cost-effective solution to local alarms and noncritical control. The PLC was also able to assist in the management of a backup system for fan failure and door control in the Clustered Isolation rooms.

355,Thermal Modelling And Simulation Of A Screw Extruder For  Additive Manufacturing Technology,"the performance of an extruder is critical to the success of an additive manufacturing process. this study presents a framework for the finite element analysis (fea) of an extruder for additive manufacturing. aluminum based on its lightweight and stainless steel due to its hot hardness property were selected as the extruder component and its heating band respectively with adequate insulation. the thermal modelling and simulation of the extruder were carried out in the ansys r19.0 environment. the indicators for the evaluation of the modelled parts were the total heat flux, temperature distribution and the direction heat flux. the results show that there is an increase in the magnitude of the heat flux around the region occupied by the heating barrel where plastic deformation takes place as a result of heating. the heat flux input however was sufficient to plastically deform the polymeric material. the effect of the insulation around the heating barrel shows capacity for temperature reduction. hence, this work will assist manufacturers who employs additive manufacturing technology for product development in the optimal design of an extruder. the fea module can be incorporated into the overall framework for the extruder development to permit an iterative process.","extruder, fea, thermal modelling","The discussion above focused on a specific product application amounting to a framework for the development of an extruder for an additive manufacturing technology as presented. The thermal modelling as well as the finite element analysis of a screw type extruder for additive manufacturing were carried out in the ANSYS R19.0 environment. The results show effective heat distribution within the heating and the magnitude of the heat flux around the region occupied by the heating barrel which indicate evidence of plastic deformation of material without burn out of the polymeric material due to heating. Hence, this work will assist manufacturers who employ additive manufacturing technology for product development in the optimal design of extruder. The Finite Element Analysis module (FEA module) could be incorporated into the development framework to permit an iterative process for the determination of the optimum range of temperature based on the required service requirements and the material’s properties.

356,System Approach Of Production System Safety,"the challenge of the economic performance is becoming more and more heavy on the companies in a context of diversified constraints imposed by their macro-system, indeed, by their environment. it is obvious that the performance of production systems is directly proportional to the level of safety of their resources. in this perimeter, our work aims to improve one of attributes of the dependability of production systems, which is the safety, during all phases of a system's life, by using a system approach developed and applied to the safety, we have called it ""the production system safety approach"". it allows to harmonize the safety to the different processes of the company in general, and to harmonize it to the production process in particular. it is based on our hypothesis of safety of classes of subsystems and interactions according to the general hierarchical diagram of a system, making reference to our development of a new tool called ""plan of microscopic analysis of risks related to classes of subsystems (or marcs plan)"".","environment, safety, production systems, system approach","This work is carried out with a view of our contribution to the development of approaches for improving the production system performance, and allowing companies from all industries around the world to be more robust and easily adapted to changes in their environment in terms of dependability in general, and safety in particular. This is thanks to a dynamic vision attached to a system approach in the area of production systems safety. The Production System Safety Approach, as a systemic approach applied to the safety attribute in the context of dependability of a production system, requires a common commitment and responsibility between the entire hierarchical line of operation or production and that of safety (or quality, depending to the structure) of the organization. By fusing the work instructions and the risk assessment in the same company item, we obtain the MARCS Plan, which unlike other safety tools, it allows a risk score reduction and a very considerable time saving through its special risk assessment procedures (Fig. 4 and Fig.5), as well as the staff involvement through the safety and the improvement of their know-how, and consequently an irreproachable optimization of the safety and the productivity of a production system in the industrial area. Our research perspective in the context of the approach we have established in this article (the Production System Safety Approach) is the realization of a case study of the Production System Safety Approach in the chemical industry. At this point we recall thanks to our experience in the chemical industry with the OCP Group and according to the Newspaper Le Site Info (2018), that this international phosphate leader obtained the gold medal of the International Fertilizer Association (IFA) on Wednesday, November 14, 2018, on the sidelines of the IFA Strategic Forum in Beijing, China, and it is for its commitment in HSE at the level of its industrial complexes: it can optimize its performance in terms of safety and productivity by applying the Production System Safety Approach. In this perspective, we can estimate the results of the application of our approach at the level of OCP Group's industrial sites: • The fusion of the work instructions and risk assessment in a single item (document) called the MARCS plan for the company, which reinforces the coordination between the safety hierarchical line and the other hierarchical lines at the level of the production divisions of OCP Group. This is the result of the application of the process approach with the aim of optimizing safety, which is (the process approach) only the system approach applied to the company. Indeed, the fusion is the result of our direct execution of the teleology postulate which was the basis of the systems theory which is one of the foundations of the system approach; • The transformation of a significant percentage of the total critical risks to preliminary risks, by reducing the threshold making the transition from preliminary to critical risk. In fact, risks with a score (SR) equal to 20 must also be considered critical risks (currently they are considered acceptable at OCP Group sites!); • Acceleration of action plans and time savings of 6 to 12 months for the prevention or even elimination of a very considerable percentage of all critical risks. Indeed, thanks to our system approach applied to the safety of production systems, critical risks with a score (SR) between 66 and 70 are also to be included in a plan of measures to be taken immediately and no longer in 6 to 12 months (currently risks of 20<=SR<=70 require measures to be taken in the short term, i.e., to be taken in 6 to 12 months).","anouar hallioui (*), brahim herrou (**) (*): industrial techniques laboratory, center for doctoral studies in engineering sciences and techniques - faculty of sciences and techniques of fez, sidi mohamed ben abdellah university, fez anouar.hallioui@gmail.com (**): superior school of technology, bp. 2427 route d’imouzzer, fez brahimherrou@yahoo.fr",
357,Evaluating The Benefits Of Project Alliance Formation  Among Contractors In Nigerian Construction Industry,"various problems interconnected with traditional procurement methods have generated more pressure to the stakeholders and end user in the construction sector to seek for new and latest operational procurement methods. project alliance is one of the acceptable methods of procurement, this is an incentive based relationship contracts where parties agree to work together as one integrated team in a relationship. so therefore, this study aimed to quantitatively assess the benefits of project alliance among contractors in nigerian construction industry. this study is a survey research that used questionnaires to gathered information from selected contractors. mean item score (mis) and standard deviation (sd) were used in analyzing data retrieved from the respondents. results indicated that achieving synergy and competitive advantage, risk- sharing, ease entry of new environment, reduction in the threat of competition among contractors were the top benefits of a successful project alliance among construction contractors in nigeria. the study therefore recommended that contractors in the construction industry need to be well enlightened through conferences, seminars and workshops on how to fully embrace project alliance within and outside the industry, strong contractual mechanism/legal backing should be made when entering into project alliance, the nigerian government should develop policies that will encourage the formation of project alliances by given one main project to three or more construction firms which are ready to form an alliance. recommendations from the study can also be applicable to other developing countries with similar way, method and style of project execution as nigeria.","project alliance, contractor, firms",,"akinrata ebunoluwa bimbola department of quantity surveying ahmadu bello university zaria, nigeria akinrataebun@gmail.com bodunde funmilayo iyabo department of quantity surveying federal university of technology akure, nigeria fjdaramola@yahoo.com ayotunde anthony babalola department of quantity surveying, federal polytechnic ado-ekiti, nigeria ayobabs27@gmail.com yakubu michael zaki department of quantity surveying, kaduna state university, kaduna, nigeria yakuzaki2@yahoo.com",
358,Evaluating The Effect Of Strategic Alliance Procurement  Method On Construction Financial Performance In Nigeria,"strategic alliance is a collaborative agreement between two or more companies to develop a joint strategy on certain operation, in which all sides take a win-win attitude. since the implementation of strategic alliances in the construction industry, there has been a great significant impact on financial performance in any approach this procurement model takes. in line with the development, this study contributed to the research field within the strategic alliance procurement in the construction industry by focusing on the impact of the strategic alliance on nigerian construction industry's financial performance in order to enhance awareness of strategic alliance in the nigerian construction industry. the study embraced survey design in gathering information from questionnaires given to construction professionals. mean item score (mis) and kruskal-wallis test (k-w) were used in analyzing data gathered from three hundred and sixty-three (363) respondents. cronbach’s α test was utilized to check the reliability level of the instrument used. it was indicted from the paper that ‘open door to new funding opportunities, ability to accrue economies of scale and scope in value-added activities, easy cash flow coordination’ are the major effect of strategic alliance on the financial performance of nigerian construction industry. the study also recommended that there should be a developed structure and standardized form of sharing formulae for profit and financial report should be given when required to ensuring openness with better understanding between both parties in other to prevent rift and lack of trust for each other. although this study was carried in nigeria, it recommendations can be applicable to other developing countries with the same pattern and method of construction.","strategic alliance, procurement, professional, zimbabwe",,"akinrata ebunoluwa bimbola department of quantity surveying ahmadu bello university zaria, nigeria akinrataebun@gmail.com ayo lahanmi estimating department mears group, inc., lenexa, kansas, usa ayo.lahanmi@mears.net ayotunde anthony babalola department of quantity surveying, federal polytechnic ado-ekiti, nigeria ayobabs27@gmail.com bodunde funmilayo iyabo department of quantity surveying federal university of technology akure, nigeria fjdaramola@yahoo.com",
359,System Approach Of Production System Reliability And  Maintainability,"history proves the permanent and incessant change of the competitive environment of the company, putting it in a stifling field of competitiveness, which forces the companies around the world to commit to the permanent optimization of their economic performance based on the continuous improvement of their production resources, in particular their material manufacturing systems, and this is linked to the need for continuous renewal and development of approaches to improve their dependability, aiming to manage the manufacturing systems with a multidimensional, flexible and crossroads approach of control and optimization, making the optimal dependability and the minimum cost of maintenance of the integrity of a material manufacturing system two faces of a same species. in this perimeter, our research work aims to improve the reliability and maintainability attributes of a system in all its life phases and within a field of maintenance cost constraints of its sub-systems, by establishing a system approach applied to reliability and maintainability, making the bridge from the science of failures and breakdowns to the discipline of mathematical programming that is part of the science of operations research. it is in view of our dynamic vision allowing us to perceive the holistic character of production system.",,"The current concept of dependability can be defined as ""the totality of an entity's abilities to achieve the specified functional performances, at the right time, for the expected duration, without damage to itself and its environment (CNAM, 2001)"". This recent definition of dependability was taken from a technical report carried out in 2001, by the French National Observatory of Arts and Crafts. Thanks to: Our dynamic and global vision of the system allowed by the systemic, in fact, attached to a systemic thinking opposite to the analytical thinking (classical or Cartesian- analytical); An exhaustive definition of the new paradigm of system defined by the systemic, which was given by Rosnay (1975), who wrote that ""a system is a set of elements in dynamic interaction, organized according to a goal""; Our general hierarchical diagram of a system showing the classes of its subsystems and the different interactions (Fig. 1), indeed, by considering the holistic character of the company and its interacting production resources, especially its production material systems. & In the framework of the development of approaches to improve the science of breakdowns and failures, in particular its reliability and maintainability components: Our Production System Reliability and Maintainability Approach can respond perfectly to the requirements of industrialists in all sectors in terms of the maximum functional performance of their production material systems crossed with their lowest possible maintenance costs. By allowing the irreproachable mastery of the maintenance costs optimization, the reliability, the maintainability and consequently the availability of the interacting sub-systems of the first class of a studied system. By consciousness and in view of the complexity of solving linear mathematical programs in addition to the considerable amount of time required to do so, we prefer working with the data analysis cell thanks to the SOLVER complement of Excel, which is used often and in a diverse field of applications, such as the maximization and the minimization of objective functions in the field of economy, the industry in general, the construction industry and military in particular. Our research perspectives were conceived only during the development of the sections of this paper, in particular, the section developing the deployment of our production system reliability and maintainability approach , as well as the section describing the pillars of system maintainability, where we thought deeply to integrate the commitment and tenacity of the company (from top management to line operators) in a Total Productive Maintenance project, as a system approach oriented towards improving the efficiency of the production system and making one of the foundations of the company's management philosophy (management culture). In this context, we proclaim that we will work on two next research projects that will be the object of two primary works entitled: The Total Productive Maintenance, from a System Approach Applied to the Company and making a Principle of Quality Management to the Company Culture Regeneration; Optimization of the System Maintainability in a Distributed Context on the Company.","anouar hallioui (*), brahim herrou (**) (*): industrial techniques laboratory, center for doctoral studies in engineering sciences and techniques - faculty of sciences and techniques of fez, sidi mohamed ben abdellah university, fez anouar.hallioui@gmail.com (**): superior school of technology, bp. 2427 route d’imouzzer, fez brahimherrou@yahoo.fr",
360,Benefits Of Functions Interdependence Between And  Autonomy Of Organization Structure Units: Case Of Small-,"despite all the positive contributions of artisanal and small-scale businesses to a nation’s gross domestic product (gdp), some of the small-scale businesses failures may be traced back to the lack of proper adequate organizational structure, organizational management, organizational governance and lack of proper accounting systems. even in the smallest business key tasks and functions must be performed regularly. stock must be purchased, bills must be paid, customers must be served, and customer queries must be accounted for. therefore, interdependence of functions of organization units are of significance in a successful business. the autonomy of structure units for small-scale and artisanal operations are scarce. this paper will discuss the benefits of functions interdependence between and autonomy of organization structure in the case of a small-scale processing of sandstone. accrued increased productivity as well as business life span extension will be presented as benefit assuring business sustainability.","unit functions, zimbabwe",,"scale sandstones processing antoine f. mulaba – bafubiandi and beejo blessing chauke mineral processing and technology research centre, department of metallurgy, school of mining, metallurgy and chemical engineering, faculty of engineering and the built environment, university of johannesburg, p.o box 17911, doornfontein, johannesburg 2028, south africa; amulaba@uj.ac.za; antoinemulaba1@gmail.com",

364,Quantum Computing Philosophy In The Extraction Of  Cobalt From Cobalt-Copper Complex Ore,"addressing todays’ challenges helps in proactively solving tomorrows problems. quantum computing is a progressive new way of performing computation to fast solve complex classical problems. this new way is based on quantum mechanics principles combined with boolean logic. minerals and extractive industries face complex problems involving large number of variables; with many of those variables being inter-dependants. the new approach to these problems would be the use of quantum computing as it is believed to possess a large advantage over classical computation in terms of speed of computerised simulation and optimisation. to simulate the optimisation of cobalt recovery during the acid leaching of heterogenite ore, quantum states will be used. a co recovery greater than 70 % in leaching is represented by a logical binary state of |1> where the co dissolution recovery less than 70% is represented by the logical binary state of |0>. once the logical gates are designed, a circuit will be formed and calculated. this paper discusses the results obtained using both quantum and classical computation to the problem. limitations and advantages regarding quantum computing will be discussed as well.","quantum computing, extraction, cobalt-copper, zimbabwe",,"antoine f. mulaba – bafubiandi and divin shabani mineral processing and technology research centre, department of metallurgy, school of mining, metallurgy and chemical engineering, faculty of engineering and the built environment, university of johannesburg, p.o box 17911, doornfontein, johannesburg 2028, south africa; amulaba@uj.ac.za; antoinemulaba1@gmail.com",

369,Optimization Of Electricity Consumption For A Galvanising  Plant Through Comparative Analysis Of Regression Analysis,"galvanising processes consume excessive amount of energy, and hence energy demand forecasting is a vital economic index for these plants. this paper discusses the relevant electricity consumption drivers for a galvanising plant for a prescribed baseline period. with electricity as the energy source, boundaries conditions were defined over a one year baseline period. the galvanised product tonnage, amount of zinc used, number dips per month, and the ambient temperature conditions were identified as the relevant consumption drivers. two approaches that include regression analysis and genetic algorithm were used to predict future energy demand for a galvanising plant. the genetic algorithm model was found to be less prone to estimation errors when compared to regression method.",be it electricity,"A multivariate regression analysis was carried out to determine the predictor variables for electricity consumption by the galvaniser and the amount of zinc used for the galvanising process was used to derive an energy consumption model for the process. A strong correlation between the electricity consumption and amount of zinc used by the galvanising process was noted from the scatter plot and a baseline regression model was derived. GA was applied to predict energy demand for the galvanizer using the relevant variables stated in the regression model. The results demonstrated that the estimations from genetic algorithm were closer to the actual data with less MAPE than that of estimated by regression, an indication that GA was more accurate than regression. 6.","and genetic algorithm mendon dewa department of industrial engineering durban university of technology durban, south africa mendond@dut.ac.za bloodless dzwairo civil engineering, midlands durban university of technology imbali, pietermaritzburg, south africa bloodlessd@dut.ac.za",

371,Design And Modelling Of A Waste Heat Recovery System For  A 250Kw Diesel Engine For Process Heating In The Energy,"diesel engines have significant application in transport, agriculture and power generation as prime movers for both medium and heavy-duty machinery including electric generators in power plants. however, the engines convert less than 40% of fuel power to useful work with the rest being lost through the exhaust and cooling systems. through waste heat recovery technology, the low grade heat in the cooling system can be recovered effectively with the organic rankine cycle. the objective of this study is to increase the efficiency of a diesel engine for fuel economy and reduce co2 emissions through waste heat recovery from both the cooling and exhaust systems. heat exchangers were proposed and designed for optimum heat recovery from both the exhaust and the coolant for a low temperature application in cereal drying. shell and tube heat exchangers are designed and modelled using computer software. the amount of energy extracted from the exhaust is 90.5 kw while that from the coolant is 95 kw with the heat exchangers having an effectiveness of 0.68 and 0.58 respectively. the recovered energy is used to heat air up to 55ºc, which is directed into a cereal dryer which is designed for maize drying, but can be used for other cereals. at a drying cycle of 10 minutes, 58 kg of maize can be dried effectively.","waste heat, heat exchanger, working mediums, heat recovery","Waste heat recovery can be applied on engine systems with sufficient power output for economic heat recovery investment. In this study, recovered energy from the exhaust is 90.5KW while that of the coolant is 95KW with the effectiveness of 0.68 and 0.58 respectively. This change with the varying engine load and engine speeds. The results are analyzed at 80% load. This is the recommended load, by the engine manufacturer. Cooling medium leaving coolant heat exchanger has set temperatures to avoid temperatures dropping beyond the recommended engine jacket cooling temperatures, which could otherwise result in ineffective engine cooling because of under cooling. The design temperatures are 501.3℃ for the exhaust and 89℃ for the coolant, with the minimum temperature of recovery being 177℃ and 24℃ respectively. However, the design temperature for the exhaust is only realized at 80% engine load. For the heat exchanger to have a high effectiveness, the design engine load range can be set at 70-90%. When the engine is operating under an engine load outside the range, a valve-operated by-pass channel will release the exhaust to atmosphere, without passing through the heat exchanger. The designed cereal dryer can dry 58kg of maize in one single operation with a discharge time of 10 min. The inlet temperature of air is 550C and the discharge time will vary with the moisture content in the cereals, with a higher discharge time for moisture contents above 20%. 7.0. Recommendations The use of engine waste heat recovery should be enhance with more research into efficient recovery technologies and systems. Investment will remain viable when fuel costs remain high and governments put in place penalties and restrictions to CO2 emissions.

372,Critical Assessment Of Cobalt (Co) And Copper (Cu)  Extraction From Co-Cu Complex Ores,"the growing demand of cobalt has been influenced by the transition to a fourth industrial revolution which requires the use of smartphones, laptops, and electric cars. cobalt (co) and copper (cu) are crucial components in the manufacturing of electronic devices. these metals are commonly extracted using hydromellurgical techniques through leaching in acidic mediums. the leach/solvent extraction/electrowinning process route is commonly used in the extraction of cu and co from complex ores. atmospheric weathering, metamorphic and sedimentary changes undergone by sulphide minerals led to the formation of cu and co oxide mineral deposits. the mixture of oxide-sulphide minerals forms complex ores in addition to either oxides mixes or sulphide mixes. the depletion of surface-rich minerals has led to mining of deep ores with 70% oxidized minerals and 30% sulphide minerals. this paper gives a critical assessment of the extraction of cu and co from complex ores. a qualitative research methodology was used in scrutinizing literature from 2010 to 2020. while heterogenite (coo.oh), chrysocolla (cu₂h₂si₂o₅(oh)₄), malachite (cu2co3(oh)2) and pseudomalachite (cu5(po4)2(oh)4) were the co and cu ores found in the literature, this paper will also elaborate on co and cu extraction from mixed oxides, mixed sulphides and mixed oxide-sulphide co and cu ores as the metals are finally recovered from their aqueous solution using lix 63, lix 64 and lix 65 prior to their specific electrowinning.","extraction, copper, cobalt, complex ores",,"antoine mulaba - bafubiandi and dorcas ruvimbo zingowo mineral processing and technology research centre, department of metallurgy, school of mining, metallurgy and chemical engineering, faculty of engineering and the built environment, university of johannesburg, 37 nind street doornfontein, johannesburg, 2028, south africa dorcaszingowoo@gmail.com.za; amulaba@uj.ac.za and antoinemulaba1@gmail.com",

375,"Development Of A Biogas Plant With Electricity Generation,  Heating And Fertilizer Recovery Systems","this study is a review of the role of biogas from agricultural biomass in the energy transition in a multipurpose application for supply of electricity, heat energy and fertilizer to support agriculture. the global concerns and commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the related global warming has set in motion effort to identify and promote renewable energy sources like biogas. biogas can be produced from any biodegradable biomass under suitable conditions making it possible for rural based smallholder farmers to effectively participate in the global energy transition to renewable and low carbon grid electricity. with development of decentralization of grid power generation, smallholder farmers can generate biogas and use it to run grid connected electricity generator to earn revenue and reduce the demand on grid s electricity. however many digesters fail and remain idle in developing countries due to lack of adequate operation and maintenance knowledge while conversion technologies available remain advanced and complex for the smallholder farmers. with proper process management, the digestate will substitute chemical fertilizers with additional financial benefits and fertility management. the farmers will also meet their entire heating requirements from a well-designed and sized biogas plant. the overall objective of this study was to identify measures and technologies that can be adopted by farmers to generate power for own use and export to the power grid while meeting other energy and farming requirements for sustainable agriculture. the study showed that biogas from agricultural wastes can play a leading role in the energy transition to green and low carbon sources for grid electricity, but a sustainable biogas system has to be multipurpose to make social economic sense to smallholder farmers. the study recommends modifications on bio-digesters and the use of the stirling engine to generate electricity at farm level though other feasible conversion technologies are available. for viability of grid supply, state incentives like attractive feed in tariffs are necessary. key words: biogas; challenges of biogas production; biogas production process; biogas engine; bio-digesters; electricity from biogas; fertilizer from biogas; stirling engines; cogeneration. 1.0 introduction the challenges of heat and electricity generation, its sustainability, cost involved, environmental issues have generated interest in in alternative sources of energy and technology globally (kabeyi & oludalapo, 2020; ndereba, 2014). energy plays a critical role for economic growth and development, thus its availability as a key indicator as well as ingredient of economic growth of any country. traditional energy though appropriate face different challenges that affect the economic growth and adaptation (scriba, 1999). majority of the in developing countries are smallholder farmers who rear livestock and undertake mixed farming (chen et al, 2017). with low electricity penetration and poverty, access to grid electricity is limited, yet they still need electricity for several application and heat for cooking and other heating applications. as a result they rely on polluting fossil fuels, and wood which accounts for accounts for 61% of the total energy sources (karuiki, 2009). non-oil producing country also face the challenge of fossil fuel price instability and pressure on foreign exchange (chen et al, 2017). this calls for a sustainable solution to save the forests and environment while to the majority rural households through biogas generation and use. proceedings of the 2nd african international conference on industrial engineering and operations management harare, zimbabwe, december 7-10, 2020 © ieom society international 146",,"This study recommends a multipurpose approach in the design of farm based biogas systems that will address the electricity needs, heating requirements, land fertility and waste management at farm level. A Stirling engine is proposed although there are several other gas to electricity conversion systems which include fuel cells, micro turbines, diesel engines, Otto cycle or petrol engines or the gasification technology with gas turbine. Redesign for improvement on available digester designs is recommended for adequate operation and maintenance at farm level especially for smallholder farmers. The normal electrical wiring will be required in the farm and all connected to the generator and/or chemical battery for electrical use while allowing for grid connection to facilitate both import and export of electricity from the biogas system. Since the generator will not be running at all time, when the gas produced is in excess, the farmer will seek to generate electricity and store it for later use. Biogas can be used for electricity generation at household level or grid supply, direct heat application or bio-methanation to enrich and package in containers for sale mainly for domestic and industrial heat application. A Stirling engine is ideal for small scale domestic electricity generation from biogas. However other feasible options are the gas turbine, fuel cells, diesel engine, Otto cycle engine or petrol engine. To avoid wastage of excess biogas, the excess will be used to generate electricity for storage or supply to the grid. Biogas is effective and efficient as cooking gas with little environmental problems which can be managed like methane leakage and risk of fire from leakages exposed to any form of naked flame. Through the costing, the biogas plant has proved to be very cost efficient and remarkable source of alternative energy. The amount of raw material needed for a continuous biogas digester process has been identified as a minimum of 4 cows producing an average of 14kg of fresh dung daily to produce the required biogas for the rural household. Cows were used for the design parameters as they are the most common animals in every rural household. However other animals like pigs and chicken are feasible alternatives. Biogas production can be improved through better digester design with the stirrer being introduced to make it easier to mix the slurry in the digester and hence get the most out of the prepared slurry. Also, the design incorporates a top trap door to enable easy servicing of the digester from time to time and avoid silt deposit at the bottom of the digester. The economic feasibility or viability of biogas plants for industrial and domestic applications is dependent on opportunities for product and utility diversification. It makes economic sense if biogas installations have can be used to supply applications like electricity or mechanical power applications for local and export supply to the grid, biogas as a fuel for other domestic and industrial applications, heat, co-generated by the combustion engine to increase cycle efficiency. The sanitation effect with COD and BOD (chemical and biological oxygen demand) reduction in the runoff from agro-industrial has a significant positive impact on environmental management and pollution control by agro based establishments. Application of the slurry in agriculture as farm fertilizer or manure will improve farm productivity and revenue for farmers. The multiple application of biogas and attractive feed in tariffs will make it possible for stallholder farmers to invest in export based electricity generation from biogas and make agriculture more sustainable and profitable.","1moses jeremiah barasa kabeyi, 2oludolapo akanni olanrewaju department of industrial engineering faculty of engineering and the built environment durban university of technology, durban, sa 1 22064693@dut4life.ac.za, 2oludolapoo@dut.ac.za",

378,Adaptive Radial Basis Function Artificial Neural Network  Control For Two-Flexible-Link Robots,"the focus of this paper is the use of an adaptive radial basis function artificial neural network (arbfann) for the control of two-flexible-link robots (tflr). flexible links are modeled as bernoulli beams. the assumed mode method (amm) together with the lagrangian approach is used to derive the closed-form dynamic. two modes are considered for each link. singular perturbation method is used to derive a composite control for the tflr. a stable robust two-time scale controller without any data for modeling is developed. the slow subsystem is controlled by an arbfann based on global approximation while the linear quadratic regulator (lqr) controller stabilizes the fast subsystem and guarantee the closed-loop stability. the arbfann with a sliding mode robust term is trained on-line to approximate unknown nonlinear system dynamics, suppress errors in the modeling of neural network and, guarantee closed-loop stability. to verify the validity of the proposed control strategy, simulation results are included.",flexible links,"In this paper, an ARBFANN control for two-flexible–link robots based on global approximation was proposed, instead of the partitioned neural network used in many papers. The approach proposed in this paper differs from the previous one as the mode shapes are derived and normalized using the generalized orthonormality relations, which results in simplified block-diagonal matrices of both links of the TFLR. The ARBFANN control guarantees the tracking of the desired trajectory while the optimal control stabilizes the vibration.

The case (Gaziantep University) of this paper has more than 50,000 students and staff. Therefore, the locations of bus stops in the campus must be distributed evenly. The distribution of the bus stops depends on walking distance of passengers. To do so, a model based on set covering problem is applied. For future studies, routing of buses should be investigated by considering the time windows (e.g. course time, shift time). If the problem size becomes larger, a meta-heuristic approach should be applied. 5.","eren özceylan and i̇brahim miraç eligüzel industrial engineering department gaziantep university 27100, turkey erenozceylan@gmail.com , miraceliguzel@gmail.com",
380,System Analysis Of Portable Water Shortage In The  Mpumalanga Province Of South Africa,"the challenge of water shortages is affecting a lot of areas in south africa especially rural areas. the government have introduced different strategies to deal with the problem. amongst the areas in south africa, mpumalanga province is one of the areas that struggles with water shortages. an investigation is conducted to address the water crisis and present solutions from the system analysis. the issues of the budget were addressed to assist with the allocation of funds that will help the communities. the effective pumping systems strategic management are also addressed in this study to assist management to maintain the leaking and burst pipes. the commercial steel is the material of the pipe used for the pumping system. the calculations of the pumping system were carried out to help with improving of the system based on the demand that arises with the increase of the population. the pumping system curves were plotted at different length of the system to improve the head while the flow rate is kept at constant.","pumping system, cost, system analysis","From the results obtained, the issue of water services in Mpumalanga can be solved and managed through the system analysis. The municipalities in the study area should take into consideration the population rate so that the water systems can be upgraded accordingly. To meet the requirement of the system, the total dynamic head is used. Dynamic head means there is a change of the pressures, velocities, elevations and friction losses when the system and the pump are in operation [8]. The total head was calculated at different length of 35m, 45m, 60m and 70m of the pumping system to monitor the total head. The results were summarised in tables 1 and 2. The trends of the graph in figure 1 was then obtained. It was observed (see figure 1) that the length of the pumping system at the same flow rate increases the head of the system. Therefore, the improvement of the system can be obtained by increasing the length of the system to meet the demand for water supply. 7.","motsi ephrey matlakala and daramy vandi von kallon mechanical engineering department university of johannesburg johannesburg, south africa motsiephrey@gmail.com, dkallon@uj.ac.za",
381,Systems Dynamic Of Portable Water Shortage In The  Limpopo Province Of South Africa,"limpopo is the hottest province in south africa and has less percentage of rain to fill up its dams and rivers. there is a higher chance for the communities to run short of water because the used water is not recycled. the villages use pit toilets, therefore, it becomes difficult to have a water recycling plant. the purpose of this study is to model the water supply chain to determine the solution for water delivery in rural areas of the limpopo province. a system dynamic model is developed using vensim software. the system is simulated to develop a solution to water crises in the province. the systems dynamics modelling is discussed herein. the vensim model was to capture the interaction between the source of water, water treatment plant, water recycling, potable water transmission, commercial and domestic water distribution. the results show that the building of infrastructure for portable water without recycling plant, will partially solve the crisis of water shortage in the province. the recycling plant is found to be helpful in saving water for future purposes.","systems dynamics, model, system, limpopo","In this study, the system dynamic model was developed to solve the challenges of water supply in Limpopo Province. The communities in the study areas get water from boreholes and rain in the season of rain. The system dynamic model for the current situation was developed, see Figure 1. Figure 2 shows that the communities will run short of water in the future should the problem of water not be addressed and solved. The system dynamic model helps with analyzing the problem and bringing suitable solution taking in considerations other challenges faced by the communities. The proposed solution for the water crisis in Limpopo is addressed in Figure 3. The recycling process is introduced to save water for the future and it can be seen in Figures 5 to 8 that the water cycle with the recycling process saves water, see the blue trend. The challenges affect the delivery of water services to the communities and need to be addressed with the purpose to improve the water delivery [11 - 12]. The health of the people is being considered, therefore, the abstracted water needs to be treated to meet the portable quality standards for drinkable water before it is distributed to the consumers. The infrastructures must be maintained regularly so that they can last for a longer period. 6.","motsi ephrey matlakala department of mechanical and industrial engineering technology university of johannesburg johannesburg, south africa motsiephrey@gmail.com daramy vandi von kallon department of mechanical and industrial engineering technology university of johannesburg johannesburg, south africa dkallon@uj.ac.za",
382,"Measurement Of Performance, Effort, Social Influence,  Facilitation, Habit And Hedonic Motives Toward Pay Later","pay later application systems are now starting to be used as a payment method for bailouts from related application companies. pay later is still within the scope of online flights and hotel ticket booking services that focus on domestic travel by traveloka, and gojek as one of the online transportation companies in indonesia. however, pay later is also offering by ovo as a smart application company that provides us with payment service and online transactions. how do customers respond to pay later facilities in two different types of quick credit or loans on their transactions, two different generations, and experiences? this study to look for factors that influence the acceptance of their customers in indonesia. base on the second generation of unified theory acceptance and use of technology as a theoretical basis to find the factors using sem partial least square. research model on this study constructs of performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influences, facilitating condition as factors of pay later intention. multi-group analysis applies to the type of companies, experience, and type of generation in the model. there are 1.201 urban workers as a sample in jabodetabek (jakarta capital city and around it) as a representation of urban features in indonesia.","pay later, utaut2, services","This study proves that performance expectancy, effort expectancy, facilitating conditions, hedonic motives and habit influence pay later intention, but not social influence. In contrast to Vekantesh's (2012) study, age, gender and experiences do not moderate the independent variables in influencing the dependent variable. This study then conducts a multi-group analysis in terms of pay later facilities, type of generation and the high and low levels of consumer transaction experiences on Traveloka and GoJek. The results show that there are differences in each independent variable in influencing the dependent variable for consumer categories using direct pay later facilities from Traveloka and GoJek compared to OVO. Millennials have different characteristics compared to generation Z.A similar pattern applies to multigroup analysis based on high and low transaction experiences. 6","application intention: indonesia evidence gidion p. adirinekso department of management faculty economics and business universitas kristen krida wacana, jakarta, 11470 indonesia gidion.adirinekso@ukrida.ac.id john tampil purba department of management faculty of economics and business universitas pelita harapan, tangerang 15811, indonesia john.purba@uph.edu sidik budiono department of management faculty of economics and business universitas pelita harapan, tangerang 15811, indonesia sidik.budiono@uph.edu",
383,Review And Parameterization Of Make To Stock Items,"this is a case study of a multinational that reviewed its parameters for the product replenishment process and analyzed the need to keep them in stock. due to the high costs that accumulated goods generate, it is always necessary to reassess whether a product still has regular and sufficient consumption to be available for prompt delivery. if this item is justified as a make to stock item, parameters must be calculated to be aware of the right moment when a purchase order must be generated to replenish the stock. the criteria used to determine whether the item is a make to stock or make to order, are applied by analyzing the consumption history of that product, its number of customers and how much its consumption varies over the months. at the end of the process, positive results are achieved, such as: increase in the service level, reduction in the amount invested in inventory and a lower expense with air freight for emergency replacement. as consumption can change over time, it is concluded that this process must be done periodically, to align the stock data with the current demand and make the planner's work more assertive.","stock1, replanish 2, for this reason","In the case of items which it is necessary to keep in stock, it is noted that the lack of product happens much less frequently, so the standard replacement (by sea) is being sufficient to keep the stock aligned. What happens in case of a stock item is sold out is the emergency purchase of a lot by air, which makes the process cost much more, since the costs of this type of freight are usually higher and may even increase more according to the weight of the goods. Once the products turned into make to order are sold out in stock, there is a significant reduction in the inventory value, which means the company stopped spending money on products that accumulate on the shelf and run the risk of not selling. It is important to remember that tax is paid for items in stock, so money loss can happen if products do not sell.As the consumption of these items is uncertain, the fact of not making them available for prompt delivery is not necessarily harmful to the company, as in a way there is never 100% certainty as to fulfill the order in its entirety, since the stock previously existing could not match that specific demand, so it is necessary for the customer to wait for the production and replacement time in any way.This inventory reduction did not significantly change the company's revenue. It is concluded that after the whole process, with the quantities of each item being properly adjusted to the current consumption of this product, the results achieved demonstrate that the improvements are very significant because there was a reduction in the amount invested in stock, maintaining the revenue.

384,The Gap Between Matric Pass Requirements And  Entrance To Engineering Education.,"the existing disparity between department of higher education and training (dhet) and department basic of education (dbe) cannot be neglected. the purpose of the study was to investigate the requirements for passing matric in secondary schools and enrolling to engineering bachelor’s degree in higher education. a sample of 400 learners/students was used to provide their perception on the requirements for passing matric and requirements for enrolling to a bachelor’s degree. the data was gathered through questionnaires and interviews. the study provides research information on the entities (high school, college, and university) and it therefore quantified the extent to which the gap exists. from the survey, majority of learners are aware of different certificates awarded after meeting the requirements for passing matric. however, these learners are not aware that entrance requirements to bachelor’s degree in different universities are not the same. learners are also not aware that a bachelor pass in matric does not guarantee them an entrance into a degree course. many students from rural areas want to pursue engineering education but they don’t have enough information about different degrees requirements and duration. the study indicates there is a need for information transfer between universities and secondary school. there should be coherence between dhet and dbe policy in order not to mislead learners.","matric, zimbabwe, december 7-10","It can be concluded that there is indeed a minimum requirement gap between matric pass requirements and engineering education entrance requirements. The gap results in students adding time by upgrading matric results then enroll for an engineering education qualification. This gap also leads students becoming demotivated and end up enrolling for a qualification they did not intend to study for since they do not qualify to study engineering. Higher institutions of learning that are offering engineering education qualifications should be involved in addressing this gap as accessibility to engineering education is very important, but it has no value if learners are not able to enroll. 6. Recommendations It is recommended that an intensive career guidance be conducted to provide high school learners with knowledge about entrance requirements to engineering education qualifications. The Department of Basic Education and Training should meet with the Department of Higher Education and Training and discuss the gap that exist between minimum pass requirements in matric and minimum entrance requirements to engineering education and other qualifications. It is also recommended that senior students who are enrolled for engineering education qualifications must be encouraged to visit the high schools they attended to share their experience and knowledge about minimum entrance requirements to different qualifications in engineering. Higher institutions offering engineering education should have dedicated staff member who go to high schools to share information about minimum entrance requirements to engineering education and other courses related to engineering.
