The findings of the enabling factors influencing Digital twins in enhancing circular economy practices in UK are an Integrated Data Ecosystem is necessary for effectively integrating digital twins in the construction industry. Digital twins are a viable technique for encouraging sustainability and circular economy principles in the building sector of the United Kingdom. Successful implementation necessitates the creation of an Integrated Data Ecosystem that gathers, organises, and analyses data from diverse sources. Utilising Advanced Data Analytics is essential for effectively implementing digital twins in the circular economy strategy of the UK construction industry. Real-time Data Analysis is a crucial component of Advanced Data Analytics that enables the immediate processing of data from digital twins, offering significant insights into the performance of constructed assets. Predictive Analytics, a crucial element of Advanced Data Analytics, helps detect possible problems by examining past data and seeing patterns, ultimately enhancing resource allocation and supporting the circular economy. The findings of the study suggest that the best way to promote digital twins in enhancing circular economy in the UK construction industry is the creation of an Integrated Data Ecosystem that gathers, organises, and analyses data from diverse sources. Utilising Advanced Data Analytics, Real-time Data Analysis, Predictive Analytics, and Virtual Design in Construction are essential for effectively implementing digital twins in the circular economy strategy of the UK construction industry.As a result, it is recommended that the role of government is important in driving this digital twin incorporation in circular economy.Sufficient government support, with clear call for more robust state-backed incentives, policies, and assistance is required and government should engage with industry leaders, experts, and stakeholders to understand their needs better and formulate supportive policies.These legislation and policies can include but are not limited to: For instance, government can give financial incentives such as subsidies and tax rebates to encourage digital twining and circular practices and development. Due to time and financial constraints, the study was limited to the Lincoln, United Kingdom; however, additional research can be conducted in the other areas of United Kingdom to provide a nationwide picture of enablers and benefits of DT in enhancing CE for the construction industry. 33",,"References

The review demonstrated the practicability of involving the novel SPS method in fabricating PI and its micro/nanocomposites. From the review, SPS sintered PI-based composites remain a promising material in the composition and development of components for mechanical load bearing and mechanical friction, as well as insulation applications. Owing to the mechanical, wear, electrical, thermal stability, and corrosion behaviour of the PI-based composites reported in the study. Thus, SPS technique could be used in mitigating issues of PI and PI-based composites degradation arising from fabricating polyimide-based material at high-temperatures due to the practicability of SPS sintered polymers at low sintering temperature when compared to the conventional method such as melt processing method. However, as SPS PI-based materials are generally characterized with high mechanical hardness and elastic modulus, challenges associated with PI-based composites using SPS sintering were also presented. Thus, more suitable optimization of the SPS and dispersion parameters should be considered in achieving more superior properties of the spark plasma sintered PI and PI-based composites.

The paper utilized a literature review to identify key conceptual drivers. Our research provides valuable insights that contribute to ongoing discussions regarding supply chain resilience (SCRes) and Gen-AI, particularly from a conceptual drivers’ standpoint. By applying the conceptual driver’s framework, we aim to enrich theoretical understanding by bridging concepts from operations management and information systems.

The paper discusses a 5 degrees of freedom robotic arm with enhanced stability for the entire working space of the robot. The development of such robotic arms must include enhanced and reliable evaluations of the robot working space and the robot space, including frame definitions, frame placement for Denavit-Hartenberg convention and specific Matlab implementations and algorithms for both direct and inverse kinematics. Such evaluations are not trivial in nature. The authors discussed the forward kinematic analytical problem and detailed the frame definition of the robot using the Homogeneous Transformation Matrix in order to relate the end-effector pose with the base frame. A Matlab approach is suggested for a numerical solution. The Denavit-Hartenberg convention infers a distal methodology to write the kinematic equations of any robotic arm. Less intuitive than the Homogeneous Transformation Matrix approach, it requires more abilities regarding the definition of the frames. The repeatability requirements of any robotic arm involved in flexible manufacturing is guaranteed by the employment of powerful and intelligent bus servos controlled by a single-core microcontroller with ARM Cortex- M3 core. Finally, the flexibility of the robotic arm discussed is supported by the implementation of multiple control methods: mouse, PC computer, joystick or smart phone. The 3D CAD model employs commercial parts and allows the export of geometric parameters for the kinematic evaluations. A scalable robotic arm with 5 degrees of freedom developed on open source platforms and based on the design discussed in the paper shows remarkable repeatability on pick and place operations.

Furthermore, nanotechnology offers an innovative platform for wearable devices, but the current state of the technology does not offer as much importance as other Healthcare 5.0 technologies. In the future, we plan to implement a more sophisticated lean assessment including both quantitative and qualitative approaches to assess the feasibility of the integration of lean principles into Healthcare 5.0 technologies. Our research efforts will also include a survey-based approach where the healthcare experts will evaluate the level of applicability of each Healthcare 5.0 technology based on our sophisticated lean assessment tool. Additionally, quantum computing technology may be included in Healthcare 5.0 technologies in future research efforts. This study can also be extended to Industry 5.0 technologies targeting more manufacturing applications rather than the healthcare focus.

An assistive device was proposed to help provide more convenient and comfortable postures for workers, to reduce the physical workload during palletizing. The postures were then simulated. The RULA was applied to study the ergonomic risks. The proposed assistive device was designed and inserted into the CATIA V5 simulation to apply an ergonomic analysis, at the best and the worst case scenarios. The results obtained from this study were as follows: • Many awkward postures were observed in the factory and simulated while palletizing. The RULA showed that all of the observed postures had a final score of 7 (very high risk). This indicated that an additional investigation and changes are required, immediately. • A proposed design of an assistive device based on the idea of rotating a screw jack that moves vertically up and down, using either pedal or motor, based on the industry was designed to reduce the workload, considering the elbow height of the 95th percentile male. The design was integrated with a wrapping dispenser that moves up and down on a rod to avoid bending, twisting and many other awkward postures. • The RULA final score after using the proposed assistive device was reduced to 4 (low risk), based on the best-case scenario (lifting at the elbow height of the worker). However, in the worst-case scenario (lifting boxes to the highest point of a full-height pallet), the final score of an observed posture was 5 (medium risk), which was similar to that of the 95th percentile of the simulated manikin, while using the device, whereas the simulated RULA score of the manikin at the 50th percentile was 6 (medium risk), due to the differences in the anthropometric measurement. 287","an ergonomic evaluation of working posture among palletizing workers based on the digital human modeling using catia mohammed said obeidat department of industrial engineering jordan university of science and technology irbid 22110, jordan msobeidat1@just.edu.jo diana bashar abbasi department of industrial and systems engineering auburn university auburn, alabama 36849 dba0011@auburn.edu","References

47,9Th North American Conference On Industrial Engineering And Operations Management  Doi: 10.46254/Na09.20240100,"with the development of advanced manufacturing technologies, the manufacturing environment becomes complex, dynamic, and filled with human-machine collaboration. to improve manufacturing performance, the efficiency of collaboration is critical. nudging, a concept in behavioral economics, is employed to indirectly encourage individuals to act or believe in a certain way through subtle interventions. in the manufacturing context, nudging aims to alter or influence operators’ behaviors to better work with technology during their interactions. meanwhile, the research of manufacturing nudging design is to investigate the theoretical foundation of design for human behaviors. to solve this problem, this paper conducts system analysis for smart manufacturing nudging design and identifies four fundamental questions, including manufacturing nudge generation, nudging behavior modeling considering affective cognition, model parameter estimation, and nudging personalization optimization. the paper further proposes a conjoint prospect theory-based approach to nudging behavior modeling. affective cognition modeling is also discussed for parameter shaping of the nudging behavior model. an example case of nudging for assembly inspection is presented to illustrate the proposed approach.","nudging design, behavioral design, prospect theory",,"smart manufacturing nudging design with conjoint prospect theoretic modeling of nudging behavior shu wang school of mechanical engineering georgia institute of technology atlanta, ga, usa shu.wang@gatech.edu feng zhou assistant professor of college of engineering and computer science dearborn, mi 48128, usa fezhou@umich.edu roger j. jiao associate professor of school of mechanical engineering georgia institute of technology atlanta, ga 30332, usa rjiao@gatech.edu","References

55,9Th North American Conference On Industrial Engineering And Operations Management  Doi: 10.46254/Na09.20240127,"different hospitals use different definitions for hospitalists’ workloads, some define it as the number of encounters per shift, and others define it as the daily census or relative value units (rvus) generated. this research paper investigates the impact of different assignment policies on the variation of hospitalists’ workloads and ed boarding time when patient acuity is considered. this paper also proposes a new policy that minimizes variation in hospitalists’ workloads, with consideration of the trade-offs between hospitalists’ workloads and ed boarding time. assigning patients to hospitalists based only on the number of patients results in a workload variation (𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊) that is equivalent to about 5.5 patients. assigning patients to hospitalists based on patient acuity helps to reduce the variation in acuity workload among the hospitalists. since policy 2 allows anywhere patient assignment, the 𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊 in policy 2 is lower than the 𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊 in policy 3 as result of having flexibility in the number of patients that can be assigned to each hospitalist. policy 2 has the best hospitalist workload balance among all three policies with 𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊 of 7.03, 7.04, and 6.98 for bed capacities of 95%, 97.5%, and 100%, respectively.","hospitalists, workload","Most hospitals are currently assigning patients to hospitalists based on the number of patients each hospitalist has. This policy of assignment does not take into consideration the variation in the patients’ health conditions. Patients with unstable health conditions and more complicated cases require more time and effort from hospitalists in order to care for these patients. Thus, hospitalists may have the same number of patients, but one hospitalist may have more difficult and unstable patients than the other hospitalist and subsequently a much greater workload. Using patient acuity in the patient assignment process helps hospitals to balance hospitalist workloads either for anywhere patient allocation (policy 2) or unit-based allocation (policy 3). However, policy 2 results in better hospitalist workload balance than policy 3. Although, policy 3 has the advantage of having all of a hospitalist’s patients assigned to only one unit. The decision to utilize policy 2 or policy 3 depends on how much hospital management is willing to accept having greater WLV in exchange for having a hospitalist’s patients dispersed over multiple inpatient units. Look ahead approaches help to improve hospitalist workload balancing. If a hospital is able to determine the acuity rate of admitted patients over a certain period of time before they are actually ready for bed assignment, then the hospital can make the assignment of those patients in advance without having them waiting in the ED in order to achieve better hospitalist workload balance. This results in better workload balance for both policy 2 and policy 3 rather than just considering the acuity rate of just the one patient that is ready for bed assignment. Note that the benefit of using a look head rule is greater for policy 3 and helps bring the workload balance using policy 3 much closer to that found using policy 2. In case the hospital is not capable of accurately estimating patients’ acuity before they are ready for bed assignment, then the hospital may need to hold patients in the ED to gather their acuity information in order to have better hospitalist workload balance. However, this results in an increase in ED boarding time and this ED boarding time increases as the look ahead time increases. In both cases, look ahead with and without waiting in the ED, hospitalist workload balance improves as the look ahead time increases. However, 85% of the reduction in WLV that occurs due to look ahead occurs for a 0.5 hour look ahead time. Thus, a hospital may only want to consider using a 0.5 hour look ahead rule in order to avoid increasing ED boarding time and expending the effort needed to predict patient acuity 0.00 1.00 2.00 3.00 4.00 5.00 6.00 7.00 8.00 9.00 95% 97.5% 100.0% WLV Bed capacity Policy 2, Look ahead with waiting Policy 3, Look ahead with waiting Polic 2, Look ahead without waiting Policy 3, Look ahead without waiting 490","impact of patient assignment policy on hospitalist workloads ahmed hamzi assistant professor, department of industrial engineering, jazan university, ksa bryan norman professor and department chair, department of industrial, manufacturing & systems engineering, texas tech university usa","References

However, this approach has introduced a new challenge for retailers. The mismatch between the demand ratio and the inventory ratio of the SKUs within a single prepack often leads to the accumulation of excessive inventory for certain SKUs over time. This paper focuses on investigating this predicament faced by retailers. Specifically, we examine the case of a retailer grappling with this challenge. The retailer routinely orders two prepacks and receives two distinct SKUs within each prepack. The demand for these SKUs is deterministic, providing a structured framework for our analysis. To optimize the total cost for this retailer, we introduce two policies: 1) Joint Replenishment Policy and 2) Sequential Replenishment Policy. With the Joint Replenishment Policy, the retailer places orders for both prepacks simultaneously, aiming to equalize the inventory levels of the two SKUs. Conversely, the Sequential Replenishment Policy involves ordering the two prepacks sequentially. In this scenario, the sequence in which the prepacks are ordered becomes pivotal, resulting in two distinct policies within the Sequential Replenishment approach. We formulate the total cost expression for the aforementioned policies and determine the optimal frequency of ordering each prepack. Moreover, in a market offering numerous prepack options, selecting the most suitable pair of prepacks becomes a critical consideration.

The best results or models were obtained with the Lazy Regressor and Pycaret libraries. For the Actual Effort model, a Random Forest Regressor was obtained as the best model, with optimized parameters, obtaining an R² Test of 94.40%, a MAPE of 6.26% and RMSE of 16.05 hours. For the capacity model, a Random Forest Regressor model was also obtained, with optimized parameters, obtaining an R² Test of 90.49%, a MAPE of 6.77% and RMSE of 4.57 projects. Different optimization methods were explored to optimize the number of projects that can be audited in a period of time. The heuristic optimization method based on iterative search turned out to be the best method in computational, practical and effective terms. Finally, visualization and Machine Learning libraries were applied to complement and/or improve the digital management tool. These libraries allow you to monitor KPIs and statistical information with historical and updated data from the audits carried out by the auditors. Additionally, there are now more complete and precise methods and processes for forecasting Actual Effort and Total Projects. Very positive feedback was received from auditors about the digital tool in general. These methods and solutions to the objectives of this project are recommended for other projects or solutions that have a similar nature or theme to that of this project. Additionally, it is recommended that this study be carried out from time to time because, over time, the optimal models found at the time this project was carried out may not adequately represent how the nature of the data behaves in future times. 591","predictive and prescriptive analytics models to support the internal audit capacity planning system of an it company patricio alejandro zamora navarro, rafael alejandro ruiz miller, roberto serna zuazua and josé d. morcillo, ph.d. escuela de ingeniería y tecnologías, universidad de monterrey, méxico patricio.zamora@udem.edu, rafael.ruizm@udem.edu , roberto.serna@udem.edu, jose.morcillo@udem.edu.mx","References

The synthesis of these methodologies was demonstrated through a case study of the Channel Tunnel project, showcasing potential enhancements in project visibility, decision-making, and overall management effectiveness. The findings from this study reveal that the integrated FRAM-PMBOK model provides a comprehensive framework for managing the complexities and variabilities in mega construction projects. The application of FRAM within the PMBOK structure allowed for a detailed analysis of project interdependencies, which facilitated better risk management, resource allocation, and scheduling. These improvements were evidenced by the enhanced project visibility and more informed decision-making processes observed in the case study. Unique insights from this study include the practical demonstration of how FRAM can be utilized to dissect complex project interactions and how its integration with PMBOK can lead to more adaptive and resilient project management practices. Additionally, coupling FRAM with System Dynamics can further enhance predictive capabilities and management strategies, leading to better overall project performance in mega construction projects. Future work should develop and test integrated models in simulations to refine these methods before practical application. The potential impact of this study on the field of project management is significant. By providing a robust framework that integrates FRAM with PMBOK, this research offers a novel method for managing large-scale construction projects more effectively. It emphasizes the importance of adaptive management strategies and highlights the benefits of incorporating systems thinking into traditional project management practices. Despite the advances made, further research is needed to validate the integrated approach across diverse construction environments. Future studies should focus on empirical validation, quantitative analysis, and comparative effectiveness research to substantiate the benefits observed in this study. Gathering comprehensive expert feedback and conducting in-depth risk management case studies will also be crucial for refining the framework and ensuring its practical applicability.

70,9Th North American Conference On Industrial Engineering And Operations Management  Doi: 10.46254/Na09.20240162,"this paper presents the design of a new system for dynamically adjusting safety stock levels based on real-time data. the proposed system addresses the challenge of balancing service level targets and financial constraints in inventory management. service level targets, directly influencing safety stock levels, aim to ensure a high probability of meeting customer demand. however, financial constraints, such as budget limitations and cash flow considerations, impose restrictions on the amount of capital that can be allocated to inventory. to tackle this problem, in this research, the proposed system utilizes abc classification to identify high-volatile items and prioritize them in the adjustment process. the goal is to minimize inventory costs while maintaining desired service levels, thus optimizing the allocation of capital and enhancing overall inventory management efficiency. the efficacy of the proposed model is demonstrated through a sample numerical data analysis, providing empirical validation of its effectiveness in real- world scenarios. we were able to create a model which can a) re-distribute the cycle service level value based on the required budget using linear programming and prioritizing high-volatile items, b) analyze various scenarios in regards to demand lead-time variations.","service level, abc classification","In this paper, three different scenarios were proposed to deal with the safety stock adjustment problem while considering a dynamic adjustment system with focus on balancing the service level targets and financial constraints while there are multiple items. Among all three proposed scenarios, scenario#3 was considered as the most beneficial approach. Scenario #3, utilizing ABC classification and linear programming, redistributes cycle service level values based on budget limitations while prioritizing SKUs according to their classification. By integrating ABC classification with linear programming, businesses are empowered to optimize inventory levels, prioritize high-value items, and adapt to budget fluctuations in real time. This approach ensures that resources are allocated efficiently, focusing on high-value items that contribute most to the company. The linear programming approach, known for its speed and computational efficiency, further enhances the practicality and adaptability of systems to real-world scenarios. A user-friendly interface has been developed to enable managers to experiment with different budget scenarios and observe their impact on inventory levels and service levels. This interactive capability fosters a collaborative environment where data-driven insights and human expertise converge to make informed decisions. This study has provided a practical tool that can be readily implemented by businesses without the need for specialized expert knowledge. The dynamic safety stock adjustment system, integrating ABC classification and linear programming, represents a significant step forward in balancing service level targets with financial constraints, ultimately leading to improved inventory performance and enhanced profitability.","proposing a new dynamic safety stock adjustment system: balancing service level targets and financial constraints sachin sivankutty 1, a and behin elahi 2, a 1 master’s student in industrial and systems engineering,2 associate professor a industrial and systems engineering (ise) department charles w. davidson college of engineering san josé state university one washington square san josé, ca, usa, 95192-0080 sachin.kanmanisivankutty@sjsu.edu, behin.elahi@sjsu.edu",

However, there are quality control issues within the value chain, encompassing four processes classified as critical points in SNI 0036:2014, namely feather sorting, feather trimming, feather straightening, and shuttlecock feathering, as well as one process not categorized as a critical point in SNI 0036:2014, which is feather stitching. These issues include concerns regarding quality control standards, lack of supportive technology in quality control, and human error. A proposal for improving quality control in the SME shuttlecock value chain involves implementing improvement designs based on value chain analysis, in-depth interviews, and root cause analysis with industry stakeholders. Further research is needed to assess improvement designs through testing before and after improvements in the SME shuttlecock value chain, as well as conducting a cost-benefit analysis to determine the feasibility of improvement designs.","identifying gaps and issues between critical points of sni 0036:2014 and existing quality control conditions in the sme shuttlecock value chain (case study: sumengko village small industry center, nganjuk) rama prananditha sularto abdi master program of industrial engineering faculty of engineering universitas sebelas maret surakarta, indonesia ramaprananditha@student.uns.ac.id eko liquiddanu and eko pujiyanto department of industrial engineering universitas sebelas maret surakarta, 57126, indonesia ekoliquiddanu@staff.uns.ac.id, ekopujiyanto@staff.uns.ac.id",

77,9Th North American Conference On Industrial Engineering And Operations Management  Doi: 10.46254/Na09.20240184,"this study addresses the high delinquency rates and inefficient accounts receivable management in consulting firms. using diagnostic tools such as value stream mapping (vsm), problem tree analysis, and the ishikawa diagram, critical factors affecting collections management were identified. an agile collections management model is proposed, involving process standardization and the implementation of a kanban board, designed to be seamlessly integrated into daily company operations. the fundamental contribution of this work is the establishment of a clear and efficient workflow that significantly improves the collections process from the sale of the service to the effective collection of payments. this model was initially tested in a digital transformation consulting services company, where remarkable results were achieved. the outcomes demonstrated a 28% reduction in the delinquency rate due to the implementation of the proposed model. other key performance indicators include a decrease in the average collection period, an increase in the proportion of clients making timely payments, and a reduction in the frequency of documentation errors. these results underscore the effectiveness of the proposed collections management model, providing a replicable framework for other firms in the sector.","delinquency, kanban","In this study, a significant improvement in accounts receivable management was demonstrated through the implementation of an agile management model using the Kanban tool. The standardization of processes, coupled with clear policies and the incorporation of tracking technologies, resulted in a 28% reduction in the delinquency rate compared to the initial diagnosis. This change highlights the effectiveness of the proposed model in the context of consulting service companies, emphasizing the relevance of agile methodologies in financial management. The research underscores the importance of interactions between sales and collections departments. Traditionally siloed, the integration of these areas has proven to be crucial for improving operational and financial efficiency. Adopting a systematic and coordinated approach not only optimizes accounts receivable management but also significantly contributes to the company's cash flow, which is vital for its sustainability and economic growth in competitive markets. The contribution of this study to the field of industrial engineering is considerable, mainly due to its focus on integrating visual management tools like Kanban into financial management, an area traditionally less associated with these methodologies. Moreover, the use of standardized policies and procedures ensures greater consistency and predictability in operations, facilitating continuous and adaptive improvement in response to market changes. In conclusion, the research demonstrates that implementing an accounts receivable management model based on agile principles and process standardization can have a profound and positive impact on a company's financial health. For future studies, it would be beneficial to explore the adaptability and effectiveness of this model across different industrial sectors, as well as its integration with other emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning for credit risk prediction and management. This direction would not only broaden the applicability of the model but also contribute to its refinement and effectiveness in various business environments.","implementation of an agile receivables management model using kanban to reduce delinquency rates in digital transformation consultancies ximena naomi paredes-chirinos bachelor in industrial engineering faculty of engineering, universidad de lima, peru 20161071@aloe.ulima.edu.pe nicolás mateo caballero-carpio bachelor in industrial engineering faculty of engineering, universidad de lima, peru ncaballero@bsf.cl juan carlos quiroz-flores research professor faculty of engineering, universidad de lima, peru jcquiroz@ulima.edu.pe",

ABC is a classification system that divides inventory items into three categories based on their relative value in the total inventory value. FSN is a classification system that divides inventory items into three categories based on consumption patterns. Activities carried out by combining ABC-FSN analysis enable the identification of types of goods so that companies can have a more holistic understanding of their inventory items and determine priorities in stock management. Companies can use appropriate and optimal strategies to predict inventory problems such as over- and under-stocks, out-of-stocks, or missed sales. There are twenty different types of items in all. From the research results, it is known that there is a classification that is obtained based on identifying the importance of goods and demand patterns based on their relative value as well as the speed of rotation and frequency of demand. The results showed that in category 1, namely the most important items and requiring attention regarding stock control (AF, AS, AN, BF, CF), there were 18 types of items (TNFD; EMDF; FPIB; WHTT; CRCW; TDFB; EMSA; WWMP; MBCM; EMFD; RLSP; EMGE; WHPL; MBBF; PPMI; SGWP; MCGR; EMCW). Category 2 which has moderate importance (BS, BN, CS) has 2 types of goods (WHID; CRAC), and category 3 which has less importance (CN) has no type of goods. ABC-FSN provides a more comprehensive understanding of items that have a high financial impact (ABC) and different consumption patterns (FSN), so that companies can manage their inventory more effectively according to the priorities and characteristics of each item.","abc-fsn analysis for inventory management policy: a case study in retail industry indesta aulia hendra putri and djoko sihono gabriel industrial engineering department indonesia university depok, indonesia putriindesta@gmail.com, gabriel@ie.ui.ac.id",

(thomack, 2022) the textile manufacturing industry in angono, rizal, philippines, continues to experience rapid growth. since its inception in 2016, this organization has acquired a substantial client base and has established partnerships with several branches in rizal, cainta, and pasig, philippines, over eight years. the commodities produced were subsequently imported into shopping centers. with eight years of experience, textile manufacturing is committed to excellence in the business market. this company sews a wide range of clothing, including t-shirts, polos, and long sleeves. emerson garments' most popular designs are two-way colored t-shirts. the company delivers its finished product to its main contractors, who supply it to numerous local malls and establishments in the philippines and internationally. 771",,"Meeting deadlines on time is crucial to various industries such as the textile industry. In identifying the causes of why the industry can’t achieve the target quota and deadline on time, many aspects, such as workers, production process, working time, and other factors, need to be considered. This study found that no time standardization, poor scheduling of jobs, no machine maintenance budget, and poor facility layout contribute to why the industry can’t achieve and exceed the target quota and deadline in time. By providing time standardization, this study shows the expected working time per piece of the t-shirts, specifically, the two-way colored t-shirt. Upon computation, the data shows that through time standardization the manufacturing can increase its output to 52 pieces, which can be produced every 8 minutes, and 3,120 outputs in eight working hours. This study also applies priority rules such as the Earliest Due Date (EDD) and the Shortest Processing Time (SPT) when scheduling jobs. The data shows that the industry can use SPT to sequence jobs if there are specific scenarios where the demands have the same deadlines. The ""Shortest Processing Time"" (SPT) scheduling strategy is advantageous in minimizing mean response times when jobs share the same deadlines. (Angel, 2016) This study also shows that using standard time along with the Earliest Due Date (EDD) and Shortest Processing Time (SPT) priority guidelines, there will be 90,480 outputs that can be produced in 39 days. Lastly, this study employed the Pro model to present the proposed process and layout enhancement by applying a group technology layout. Various approaches using Pro Model have been explored in the literature. Studies by Marcelo et al. (2016), Duque et al., 2016 Cabusas et al (2023), Abad et al.(2023) are among them. The implementation of Group Technology (GT) layout design has proven advantageous in the sewing sector, as evidenced by multiple research studies. Genetic programming facilitates categorizing components with comparable attributes into clusters and allocates specialized machinery groups (cells) to handle these clusters, thereby reducing the movement of materials between cells. (Fahturrohman, et. al, 2023). This study shows that the present layout average time on the system is 152.22 while the proposed average is 132.12. In addition, this arrangement reduces the duration of transport delays by 2 minutes. The data indicates that the proposed layout effectively reduces the industry's production time by 13.2%. In future research, alternative scheduling sequencing methods, such as Earliest Start Time (EST), Smallest Job Next (SJN), Largest Job Next (LJN), and Least Slack Time (LST), will be explored. Additionally, Other scheduling techniques will be considered to enhance resource and task management by providing greater flexibility and efficiency.","a scheduling textile industry-based problem utilizing priority rules and promodel in the philippines lyka villegas, zendry louie mabilangan, alliyah jann portuguez, daniel johns tagibao, gabriel jerome sabangan, jonnamae valdeviezo and maricar m. navarro industrial engineering program college of engineering and architecture technological institute of the philippine quezon city, philippines qzl-mabilangan@tip.edu.ph, qajportuguez@tip.edu.ph, qgjrsabangan@tip.edu.ph, qdjntagibao@tip.edu.ph, qjmrvaldeviezo@tip.edu.ph, lykanvillegas@gmail.com, mnavarro.ie@tip.edu.ph",

93,9Th North American Conference On Industrial Engineering And Operations Management  Doi: 10.46254/Na09.20240223,"several extensions of conventional fuzzy sets have been introduced, including neutrosophic, intuitionistic, and pythagorean fuzzy sets. these extensions aim to enhance the explicit and informative definition of decision-makers' judgments by incorporating membership functions with three distinct dimensions. a recent addition to the realm of ordinary fuzzy sets is the development of sfss (spherical fuzzy sets), which are characterized by generalized three- dimensional structures. sfss represent one of the latest advancements in extensions such as neutrosophic, intuitionistic fuzzy, and pythagorean fuzzy sets. given that decision-making is a daily activity, often involving the selection of the best candidate from multiple options, mcdm (multi-criteria decision making) methods have been designed to address the challenges. this study focuses on utilizing the sf-copras (spherical fuzzy complex proportional assessment) mcdm method to evaluate hazardous waste management problems within a gdm (group decision making) framework. the hazardous waste disposal problem is assessed with five alternatives and six criteria to showcase the applicability and validity of the developed sf-copras approach.","hazardous waste, mcdm, copras","The primary goal of this study is to identify the most suitable candidate for addressing a hazardous waste disposal problem through the consideration of a set of evaluation criteria. Evaluating candidates involves the scrutiny of various qualitative and quantitative criteria. MCDM techniques serve as scientific methodologies capable of assessing both qualitative and quantitative criteria simultaneously. Consequently, COPRAS, a distance-based MCDM method, has been employed to evaluate alternative hazardous waste disposal sites. The process of selecting the optimal hazardous waste disposal site requires a careful consideration of decision criteria, a task accomplished through a literature review and input from three DMs. The SFS COPRAS MCDM method is then applied to assess and rank all candidate sites based on the identified attributes. The selection of the SFS environment serves as an objective framework for evaluation and ranking, chosen for its ability to handle imprecise and vague data effectively. This method is particularly useful in addressing uncertainty in complex decision problems. To validate the developed approach, a practical case study is presented. Looking ahead, future research aims to extend the application of this method to diverse sectors. Additionally, upcoming studies may involve comparing the results of these alternatives with other fuzzy logic-based MCDM approaches.

The aviation industry, which has made significant developments in recent years, is witnessing a new revolution called aviation 4.0 with the effect of digital transformation. The main purpose of this digital technology-based transformation is to provide more benefits to customers. At this point, the service quality perception of digitalized customers with today's digital world has radically changed. This is also true for the aviation industry. Companies that are the players of the aviation industry need a roadmap in such a transformation journey. It has become more important than ever to determine the critical points that companies should consider for their digital service quality performance. A high digital service quality performance means customer satisfaction and being able to compete in the market is only possible by meeting the demands and expectations of the customers in the best way and gaining their loyalty. For this reason, strategic analysis of digital service quality is aimed in this study. To make industrial comments and check the validity, the study was applied to a real case in the Turkish aviation industry. To prioritize digital service quality elements and calculate their weights, the AHP method, which is used extensively in the aviation industry, was preferred. Due to the complexity of real-life problems, the uncertainty involved in the decision-making processes carried out by DMs, and human perception, the classical AHP method has been extended to the fuzzy environment and applied as FAHP methodology. 884","digital service quality analysis in aviation industry with aviation 4.0 perspective using fuzzy analytic hierarchy process methodology gülçin büyüközkan and orhan feyzioğlu professor doctor, professor doctor industrial engineering department, galatasaray university 34349, istanbul, turkey gbuyukozkan@gsu.edu.tr, ofeyzioglu@gsu.edu.tr celal alpay havle doctor of industrial engineering, received from graduate school of science and engineering, galatasaray university 34349, istanbul, turkey celal.alpay.havle@gmail.com","References

From the studies carried out, Ebenato town is situated on a porous sandstone ridge, this makes it susceptible to gullying due to the weak nature of the substratum. Natural and anthropogenic factors played major role in the widening of the gully, however, the unsustainable practices by the locals such as making ridges along slope gave a leeway to the devastation experienced in the town today. Other unsustainable practices like dumping of municipal solid wastes (MSW) in the gully has an impact in the water resources, especially the Ofala River which showed presence of heavy metals. It is recommended that the locals should quit indiscriminate disposal of wastes in the gully and make their ridges for cultivation across slope. These two practices will promote sustainability once there is strict compliance. Establishing legislation and enacting fines will checkmate the rate of compliance.","integration of geographic information system (gis), gully erosion, and water quality data in promoting sustainable practices; a case study of ebenato, nnewi south, anambra state, nigeria solomon okeke, chekwube didi and nelson nwobi institute of environmental engineering, people’s friendship university of russia, moscow, 117198, russia solomonekene.o@gmail.com, didichekwube@gmail.com, nwobinelson@hotmail.com franklin osuagwu department of geophysics nnamdi azikiwe university, awka, nigeria franklincosuagwu@gmail.com",

Explainable AI is another area that holds promise for asset maintenance. Developing AI models that can provide clear explanations for their predictions and recommendations can increase trust and adoption among maintenance personnel. By understanding the reasoning behind AI-driven decisions, maintenance teams can more effectively collaborate with AI systems and make informed judgments. Explainable AI can also help identify potential biases or errors in the models, ensuring that maintenance decisions are fair and unbiased. Moreover, explainable AI can facilitate compliance with regulatory requirements, as organizations can provide transparent and auditable explanations for their maintenance actions. The integration of AI in asset monitoring and maintenance represents a significant shift in how organizations approach equipment data collection, analysis, and decision-making. By harnessing the power of AI, companies can transition from reactive to proactive maintenance strategies, optimizing resource allocation, reducing downtime, and improving overall equipment reliability. As organizations continue to adopt and mature their AI capabilities, approaching implementation with a strategic and long-term perspective is crucial, considering the technical, economic, and organizational factors that influence success. By embracing the transformative potential of AI and fostering a culture of innovation and collaboration, organizations can unlock new levels of efficiency, reliability, and performance in their asset maintenance operations, ultimately driving competitive advantage and business growth in the era of Industry 4.0. 952",leveraging ai for enhanced equipment data collection and asset monitoring raghunandan gurumurthy crossover solutions usa inc united states raghu.gurumurthy@xosol.com aditi godbole university of texas at arlington united states aditi.godbole01@gmail.com aricson pereira procept biorobotics united states ericpereira87@gmail.com,"References

107,9Th North American Conference On Industrial Engineering And Operations Management  Doi: 10.46254/Na09.20240257,"the increasing worldwide adoption of solar energy motivates the need for innovative solutions to optimize the operations and maintenance (o&m) of solar energy systems. soiling, i.e., the accumulation of material such as dust on solar photovoltaic (pv) arrays, poses a key challenge for solar operators as it can compromise the performance and reliability of solar energy systems. to address this challenge, we develop a machine-learning-(ml)-based in-situ monitoring solution in order to timely detect the occurrence of soiling events, thereby alerting operators to take necessary mitigation measures for the cost-effective management of their assets. first, an experimental testbed has been set up at the energy lab at rutgers university–new brunswick, wherein a new optical sensing technology is installed on an operational pv system in order to collect sensor measurements about the soiling ratio under normal and abnormal conditions. then, a cluster of ml classifiers are trained on those sensor data in order to effectively dis- entangle the random variations in soiling ratio versus systematic drops due to ongoing soiling, and finally output a probabilistic decision on the soling status of the pv system. our experiments on three artificially generated soiling events in 2023 suggest that kernel-based models such as support vector machines–when supplemented with a newly introduced feature that describes the rate of change in soiling ratio—can produce up to 99% accuracy in predicting soling events, while maintaining a sensible balance between false and missed alarms (up to 85.4% in f1-scores).","machine learning, solar energy","and Future Research The rapid expansion of solar PV systems worldwide has created an emerging need for cost-effective ways to reduce the O&M expenses of solar farms. In this work, we present a ML-powered soiling detection system that uses data from a state-of-the-art optical soiling sensor, DustIQ, that has been mounted on a PV solar array at the Energy Lab at Rutgers University in New Jersey, USA. Data from three different soiling experiments were analyzed and used to train ML classifiers that have been shown to effectively detect the occurrence of soiling, especially when supplemented with a newly introduced feature that captures the rate of change in soiling ratios. This work demonstrates an example of how new sensor technology can be successfully combined with ML to help optimize the O&M operations of a solar farm, thus contributing towards enhancing the economic outlook of solar energy. This work paves the way for exploring a number of research avenues for further development. Firstly, our models were trained on a relatively small dataset that utilized one data source: soiling ratio. Future works could incorporate additional soiling experiments, as well as exogenous variables such as temperature or humidity to finetune the soiling detection system. Likewise, new features, that are defined in a similar manner to the square soiling slope (SS), can be created and introduced to further bolster the training data, perhaps through a semi-automated feature engineering and selection approach. Finally, although real time detection of soiling is indeed valuable, anticipating future soiling events is of equal importance, but is understandably a more challenging problem to address. 1008","detection of soiling events in solar photovoltaic systems using in-situ optical sensing and machine learning nicholas percarpio and ahmed aziz ezzat rutgers, the state university of new jersey, piscataway, nj, 08854, usa nmp231@scarletmail.rutgers.edu, aziz.ezzat@rutgers.edu","References

GPT, Gemini, Copilot and Claude are skilled at formulating LP problems. They demonstrate a notable ability to define decision variables, formulate objective functions and constraints. This indicates that LLMs prove to be a useful aid for formulating LP problems. However, it is crucial to highlight that one should not solely depend on the Generative AI tool, as our findings point out their tendency to make errors. In our study we found that ChatGPT stands out as the best performing model but exhibited high score variation. On the other hand, Copilot and Gemini show low variations among all models and thus being reliable options for applications that demand accurate linear programming problem formulation. particularly in defining decision variables. Llama exhibits markedly lower performance, suggesting that it may need significant enhancements or might be less appropriate for tasks necessitating exact mathematical modeling. In conclusion, the extent to which generative AI tools effectively automate the development of LP models typically handled by students/professionals is limited. Our results recommend using these tools with caution, acknowledging their value but also their limitations due to their variable dependability and tendency of occasional mistakes. There are interesting future opportunities in research, education, and practice that could build off of this exploratory work. In terms of research more tests should be conducted with varying levels of difficulty non-linear problems including quadratic objectives and integer variables. As this area of research matures, it can be expected to find applications in education such as serving as a real-time tutor for students learning mathematical modeling. A longer terms objective for this line of research is to develop technologies that can be scaled to address industrial scale problems and also in developing interfaces appropriate for operational managers to readily solve their problems. The scope can also be broadened by incorporating more AI models and newer versions. The number of test problems can be increased in terms of size and complexity to provide more insights on improving and applying them in practice. A set of benchmark problems could be made publicly available as the interest in this area grows. The study considers only the accuracy of the solution, not other factors such as the computational time and other performance metrics of the generative AI, which is a limitation that can be addressed in the future.","can the “art” of mathematical modeling in industrial engineering be automated by ai? shrushti mardikar, abdullah aldhuhayyan and vittaldas v. prabhu department of industrial and manufacturing engineering pennsylvania state university university park, pa, usa sum403@psu.edu, axa1534@psu.edu, vittal.prabhu@psu.edu",

Disruptions such as the semiconductor shortage in September 2021, which significantly reduced U.S. new-vehicle 
supply, illustrate the volatility in the market. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic caused massive disruptions in 
sales worldwide. Total vehicle sales dropped by 48.12% from February 2020 to April 2020, the onset of the pandemic, 
whereas the decline for BEVs was only 29.06%.  Additionally, by the time the Russia-Ukraine conflict started in late 
February 2022, gas prices rose, which potentially could affect people's choices in buying EVs. As the U.S. strives to 
keep up with EV leaders like China and Europe, new policies and incentives, such as tax credits of up to $7,500 for 
new vehicles purchased in or after 2023, are expected to drive the upward trend in EV adoption. Thus, relying solely 
on quantitative data, despite its informative and helpful insights, may not suffice given the immaturity of the EV 
market. In future research, qualitative factors, including political and policy incentives, must also be considered. 
 
Moreover, EV sales directly impact the volume of returned EVBs. As illustrated in Figure 8, we anticipate a significant 
volume of battery returns by mid-2035. Consequently, governments, recovery companies, and other entities in this 
reverse supply chain must prepare by adjusting regulations and capacity. Technological advancements, as outlined in 
Table 2, also influence the lifespan of batteries and their return rates. By using dynamic lifespan estimates, we have 
attempted to account for part of this effect. Factors such as raw material availability, regulatory changes, EV owner 
behavior, and charging infrastructure all play a role in determining these rates.

Digitalization transforms industries, redefining production processes, leveraging human expertise, and altering the role of workers. To enhance trust in the reliability and ethical standards (""moral integrity"") of M/LLM we should ensure that these systems meet the highest standards of rationality, explainability, security, stability, open-mindedness, and adaptability to culturally diverse perspectives (including but not limited to multilingualism), addressing the concerns of responsible security, privacy (for users and with regards to training data), and quality of service (inclusive of accuracy, availability, and responsiveness). In this manner we can bolster their ethical standing and public acceptance. Although different in their approach, complexity, and practical implementation, current MLM inference processes share the general principle of learning from data and making predictions with Solomonoff induction. In this context, Kolmogorov complexity plays a key role as a measure of the computational resources needed to specify an object, with the challenges that loss of information poses in cognitive processes such as memory compression. On the balancing of copyright protection, the key seems to be the concept of authorship and the degree and quality of human-made intellectual contributions, not very dissimilar from Shapley's value in economic theory for fair payoff allocation (Ali et al., 2023). Another pivotal factor in determining the legal status of such works globally is the determination of what is considered a “de minimis” amount of content, or even if defining a sharp cutoff criteria is appropriate within the context of AI-assisted creation e.g., in the intellectual and artistic spheres, or in the workplace. Some of the problems derived from the intrinsic lack of explainability and other issues with AI can be somewhat ameliorated to reduce errors and enhance safety, especially in the context of balancing automation and human expertise in sensitive areas like healthcare, through human-centered approaches, mistake-proofing poka-yoke methods for control of single points of failure, adaptive continuous learning, and stress-tested distributed redundancy with human supervision, drawing methods from fields like control & resilience engineering, fault-tolerant computing, systematic error reduction, and safety-critical systems. On safety and security, particularly in cybersecurity, privacy-related, and military applications, extraordinary global efforts are advisable, specifically targeted towards enhancing defensive capabilities, severely limiting autonomous offensive capabilities, guaranteeing civil rights, leveraging AI-enhanced diplomacy, e.g., trustworthy real time translation services, and de-risking in a Richardson's arms race model-aware manner.

Likewise, a Pareto diagram identified that the first two were the ones with the highest weight on the analyzed indicator with a total weight of 83%. Through the elaboration of the state of the art related to the case study, the main tools to be applied to each of the causes of the problem encountered were identified and determined. These tools are SLP to reduce process travel distances, SMED to eliminate times external to the use of the machine and thus optimize the key process that is the manufacture of garments, standardization to equalize the work done by all operators and thus reduce time and quality problems; and, finally, TPM, to reduce machine failures, thus improving product quality and reactive maintenance downtime. With the implementation of the proposed tools and through a simulation of the production process, it was possible to identify significant improvements in the different stages. In total, it was possible to increase the level of service from 72% to 91%. This is due to the reduction of the travel of 25.7m in SLP, of times with SMED of 4.9 minutes of set up and with the standardization a reduction of 1.9 minutes per garment. As part of the stakeholder analysis, it was necessary to focus on the impacts of the activities on them. One of the most important is the environmental and health impacts, in which it was possible to identify that the most aggravating activity for both factors is that of printing due to the emission of polluting odors. Based on the financial analysis carried out for the investment of the improvement, this proposal is quite profitable since it has a positive NPV of S/ 114,050.18 and an IRR value higher than the percentage of COK obtained.
