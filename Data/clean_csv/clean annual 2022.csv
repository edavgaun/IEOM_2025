0,Texture Analysis Of Electrical Discharge Machined (Edm)  Surfaces Using Vision System,"predicting the functionality of an engineering component is possible by the evaluating of roughness of the machined surface. researchers have been proposing different approaches for the measurement of surface roughness. highest accuracy in roughness measurement is possible by contact type measurement. non-contact type of roughness measurement is fast but do not provide complete information for the complete surface characterization. these techniques fail to measure the roughness of complicated objects. in this scenario, present method becomes very important. vision system is used for the roughness evaluation. the present method is capable of measuring the surface finish of edm components and also highest measuring speeds are possible.",edm inspection,The present method is a non-contact approach for measuring roughness of EDM components. The method used a vision system for evaluating surface roughness of EDM components. The digital images are used for computing the texture features through GLCM. Experimental results demonstrated excellent correlation between contrast and Ra in between 2 μm to 4.5 μm. Roughness of molds and dies are measured by this method.,"m. b. kiran department of mechanical engineering school of technology pandit deendayal energy university gandhinagar, gujarat, india mb.kiran@sot.pdpu.ac.in",

2,Weaponizing Cost Of Quality Of Food Manufacturers:  Implications For Organizational Performance,"owing to the current business environment, food manufacturers must provide high-quality products while simultaneously providing competitive prices for their customers. cost of quality (coq) can play a crucial role in fostering organizational competitive performance through reduced costs. the aim of this paper is to analyze the interrelationship between the application of coq and organizational performance in the context of palestinian food manufacturing organizations (pfmo). the study employs a questionnaire through which data is collected from 119 pfmo. the collected data is analyzed using the partial least square structural equation modeling (pls-sem) technique. the results of this study suggest that application of coq practices has a strong effect on the organizational performance of pfmo. external, internal, and prevention costs were all found to have a positive impact on organizational performance of pfmo. however, appraisal cost has no impact on organizational performance. the study provides significant value to quality management literature on the role of coq practices in enhancing performance of food manufacturers in a developing country context and responds to calls for enhancing organizational efficiency in today’s complex business environments.","cost of quality, food manufacturing","The current study provided a critical investigation of the interrelationships between the application of COQ practices and organizational performance in PFMO. This study confirmed a strong relationship between COQ and PFMO performance. It was also confirmed that PC, EFC, and IFC all have a strong relationship with PFMO performance. The only relationship that was not supported is the relationship between AC and PFMO performance. In addition to the new insights that this paper provides on the investigated relationships in the context of developing countries, it has interesting theoretical and practical contributions. The current study provides evidence on the need for mangers to invest more in PC such as customer analysis, quality planning activities, and training of employees. Consequently, this can help managers to dramatically reduce IFC and EFC that can increase competitive advantage. The paper also theorizes the concept of COQ with food manufacturing industry in the context of developing countries for the first time. This theorization also provided empirical evidence about the role of COQ practices in boosting organizational performance in the food manufacturing sector. Therefore, it is essential that future research work consider replicating this study in other food manufacturing organizations in other developing countries to confirm and compare results. It would also be worthy to replicate this study through applying longitudinal research methods to capture the changes in organizational performance indicators over a long period of time. Finally, future studies may consider the inclusion of the customer voice in the tested relationships to investigate their perception of organizational performance improvements.

3,Green Asphalt Pavement Mix Design For Kuwait,"kuwait suffers from potholes due to pavement deterioration when exposed to moisture. this paper investigates the feasibility of using recycled asphalt pavement in hot mix asphalt design. questionnaires were conducted to analyze the effects of pores on the society. the results of a series of laboratory tests, which compared the performance of both the recycled and the regular mixtures, showed that the recycled mixture has higher stability and flow, lower rutting depth for wet and dry samples, and lower voids filled with asphalt and voids in mineral aggregate. on the other hand, the tensile strength ratio test results recommended to reduce the proportion of recycled aggregate. while, the hwtd test required 20% reduction in the wet recycled mixture. therefore, the recycled mixture reveals a higher efficiency in saving costs and improving mixtures used for potholes maintenance activities. all the results proved that the recycled asphalt mixtures are most preferred since they are affordable and perform reasonably well compared to regular asphalt mixtures. as a future work, smaller percentages of recycled aggregate should be tested to check the robustness and sustainability of the designed recycled asphalt mixture. furthermore, more experiments can be run to test other mix parameters and properties.","pothole, recycled aggregate, maintenance, pavement",,"sharaf alkheder professor in civil engineering faculty of engineering and petroleum kuwait university p.o. box-5969, 13060, safat, kuwait. sharaf.alkehder@ku.edu.kw","References

4,Research On Cultivation Planning Based On Resource Sharing  Among Fruit Growers,"in japan, the problems of farming workforce ageing as well as lacking successors are getting serious rapidly. if this trend continues, the number of farmers is expected to decline further, japanese agriculture itself is facing a great crisis. in order to alleviate these problems, make farmers realize stable management by securing profit is necessary. in particular, it is rather difficult for small and medium-scale farmers or small and medium-sized enterprises, who are mainly engaged in open-field cultivation such as fruit trees, to secure a stable income. because they should bear large costs of purchasing and maintaining farm machinery and equipment, as well as the labor cost of harvesting during the harvesting season, under an uncertain cultivation environment that is highly dependent on the weather. in this study, we propose a system of cultivation resource sharing and develop optimal cultivation plans based on resource sharing plans. the effectiveness and applicability of the system to improve farmers' profitability are also examined by numerical experiments.","fruit growers, tokyo",,"kotomichi matsuno department of business design and management, graduate school of creative science and engineering, waseda university 3-4-1 okubo, shinjuku-ku, tokyo, japan sidiwu@aoni.waseda.jp",
5,Spatial-Temporal Coverage Planning For Universal  Infrastructure Services,"an important component in decision making for public sectors relates with siting of facilities to achieve full or maximal coverage across an area to serve. given a region, optimal deployment of facilities is sought from potential points. the objective is to find the minimum number of facilities achieving complete coverage, or to find the maximum coverage constrained by a fixed number of facilities. they are dealt in a set covering context; the former is called the location set covering problem (lscp), while the latter is known as the maximum covering location problem (mclp). the shape of coverage by a single facility is typically circular, commonly with square, rectangular, and elliptic variations. along with a geographical dataset, a demand region is given by a polygon or alternatively by segments or points. potential facility sites are given by a set of points. the attribute of a facility siting is associated with a binary {0, 1} decision variable, and the associated problem is reduced to either an inter programming (ip) or a mixed integer programming (mip). this problem formalization is applicable to siting of infrastructure facilities such as fire stations, police stations, cell towers, warning sirens, airborne radars, precipitation monitoring sensors, and so on. this type of infrastructural system is forced to spend at least tens of thousands of dollars for the installation of a single facility, for which minimization of the number of facilities is paramount in the planning phase. meanwhile, another but similar type of infrastructural system is concerned with coverage of an entire region occasionally with a limited number of facility resources. a sited facility is capable of covering a region, typically regulated by distance of travel time, but all sited facilities cannot cover the entire region of interest at one time instant. instead, a facility is mobile or capable of moving around, with which the entire region can be covered within a time standard. security patrol, whether with a vehicle or feet, is a practical application; for example, multiple police officers patrol a town to ensure the entire region is “covered” (secure in practice), where the coverage is attained within a time slot, typically several hours. this kind of operation might be formalized as a sort of {0, 1} decision making problem, but no formalization of coverage accounting for both space and time exists to date. along these lines, this study models and formalizes a spatial-temporal set covering problem accounting for mobility of facilities. any demand point must always be covered within a time standard, which is comprehended as an proceedings of the international conference on industrial engineering and operations management istanbul, turkey, march 7-10, 2022 ieom society international 31",,,"hiroyuki goto department of industrial and systems engineering hosei university koganei, tokyo, japan goto-h@hosei.ac.jp taiki otsuka faculty of business design and informatics tsukuba gakuin university tsukuba, ibaraki, japan otsuka@tsukuba-g.ac.jp yoichi shimakawa department of computer science and technology salesian polytechnic machida, tokyo, japan simakawa@salesio-sp.ac.jp",
6,Solution Method For A Max-Min-Plus Scaling Scheduling  Problem By Formula Manipulation,"a discrete event system (des) changes the internal states at discrete time instants according to event occurrences. regular systems have a structure of parallelization and synchronization of multiple events. in formulating a scheduling problem in a des context, the earliest event occurrence time is described by the ‘max’ and addition operations. these operations correspond to the synchronization and time elapse of events, which are respectively represented by addition and multiplication in max-plus algebra. the time instant of earliest event occurrence is associated with the earliest completion time in the program evaluation and review technique (pert) context. the max-plus linear (mpl) representation described in max-plus algebra is beneficial in dealing with formulation of scheduling problems in pert. on the other hand, the max-min-plus scaling system (mmps), an extended formalization of max-plus algebra, provides a richer descriptive capability than that of mpl systems have. this involves the ‘min’ operation, in addition to the ‘max’ and addition operations. the ‘min’ operation represents selection of events applied to scheduling problems. in contrast to the mpl representation, however, it has been hard to obtain an explicit solution in the max- min-plus (mmp) equation, where a scheduling problem on mmps can be confined to an mmp equation. in this study, we focus on a scheduling problem with a directed acyclic graph (dag)-structured network. the aim is to develop a framework for solving mmp equations. since a dag is acyclic, an mmp equation associated with the earliest completion time has constantly a solution. thus, an mmp equation could be solved directly through formula manipulation using a computer; some algebraic expressions might aid representing efficiently the relevant operations along with associated parameters. with the constructed framework, mmp equations can be solved in a straightforward manner, even for large-scale systems for which the resulting formula would be intractable in dealing with it manually.","max-plus algebra, scheduling, turkey",,"kyohei sagawa faculty of information & management systems engineering nagaoka university of technology nagaoka, niigata, japan s203357@stn.nagaokaut.ac.jp hiroyuki goto department of industrial & systems engineering hosei university koganei, tokyo, japan goto-h@hosei.ac.jp yoichi shimakawa department of computer science & technology salesian polytechnic tokyo, japan simakawa＠salesio-sp.ac.jp",
7,Optimizing The Compliance Of Critical Covid-19  Preventive Measures In Airport Facilities Layout: A Hybrid,"due to the covid-19 pandemic, measures were enforced on air travel to limit the spread of the virus as a step towards mitigating health and financial risks. this study aims to reveal the most critical covid-19 measures in airports that effectively reduce potential risks. in addition, the study aims to put forward a framework to redesign internal airports facility layouts that facilitate reducing passengers’ cycle time and ensure optimal compliance with the revealed measures based on their priorities. a compiled list of imposed preventive measures is used for the design of a questionnaire survey targeting the opinions of experts in the fields of epidemiology and infectious diseases, as well as airport managers and operational staff for the collection of measures' importance weights and rating data. the internal facility layout of a typical domestic medium-sized airport in saudi arabia was also captured, along with its pertaining data were also collected. a hybrid approach was followed using: the visekriterijumska optimizacija i kompromisno resenje (vikor) technique in serbian, which means: multicriteria optimization and compromise solution, the systematic layout planning (slp) procedure, and the computerized relative allocation of facilities technique (craft) to generate airport facility layout alternatives. results of the study revealed a prioritized set of critical covid-19 preventive measures within airports. furthermore, an optimal internal layout redesign of an airport facility is developed based on the revealed set of prioritized measures. implications of this study include the proposed hybrid approach of the used methods and the revealed set of prioritized covid-19 preventive measures in airports. which can assist decision-makers and responsible authorities of airports in increasing the compliances with enforced measures through optimized layout designs of airports limiting the spread of viruses and pandemics.","airports, covid-19 measures, layout, optimization","The first main objective of this study was to reveal the most critical COVID-19 preventive measures in airports that effectively reduce potential risks. This was achieved through the collection of COVID-19 measures in airports based on which a questionnaire survey was designed targeting the opinions of experts in the fields of epidemiology and infectious diseases, as well as airport managers and operational staff. Using the VIKOR technique, results show that the most critical COVID-19 measures in airport facilities are glass barriers, floor posters, cart & facility disinfection, 2-hour prior arrival, and face masks. Results also show that the safety of employees and protection is key and that using glass or acrylic barriers can protect both employees and passengers. Moreover, floor posters and facility disinfection are considered important in ensuring safe social distancing between passengers in the facility and sanitizing every touchable surface. Furthermore, early arrival helps airport staff sufficient time to serve passengers and regulate their flow. Face protection is also considered an essential measure for both employees and passengers. The second main objective of this study was to optimize the compliance of the revealed prioritized set of critical COVID-19 preventive measures in airport facilities' layout. A typical domestic medium-sized airport in Saudi Arabia was selected to capture the currently adopted internal facility layout and to collect input data related to the activities involved, the flow of passengers, activity relationships, space requirements, and the space available. The revealed prioritized set of critical COVID-19 preventive measures along with SLP procedure and the CRAFT technique were all used to generate airport facility internal layout design alternatives. An optimal alternative was selected based on reduced passengers’ cycle time and the level of its compliance with the revealed preventive measures and their priorities. Implications of this study include the proposed hybrid approach of the used methods and the revealed set of prioritized COVID-19 preventive measures in airports. Which can assist decision-makers and responsible authorities of airports in increasing the compliances with enforced measures through optimized internal layout designs of airports limiting the spread of viruses in pandemics.

9,Upcycling Design Process And Classification Of Upcycling  Method As Innovation To Extend Product Lifecycle,"fashion industry is one of the biggest and most successful industries, but also at the same time it contributes the biggest pollution in the world. discarded clothing and garment factories result in massive garment and textile waste. this keeps happening because of the consumers’ consumptive behavior and lack of knowledge in repurposing clothes. to solve this problem, customers need to be educated in repurposing clothes and adding value to the product. this way, it can extend fashion products’ life cycle, and decrease the consumption of massive fashion products. this research aims to identify the upcycling design process in fashion and also classify the methods and techniques in repurposing clothes (especially upcycling), such as 1) subtraction which includes cutting, cropping, slashing of fabrics and garments, 2) deconstruction which includes division and reassembling clothes and other textile materials, 3) addition which includes embellishment assembling, patchworking, etc. and 4) refunctioning which is reusing old products for new purpose. this way, not only upcycling methods are more structured and accessible to everyone, also the upcycling methods and techniques can be employed in the design development of old garments to extend the garments' lifecycle.","upcycling, fashion, design process, methods","Design thinking is an iterative process, and in designing, we need to use our empathy to connect with the problem occurred. Upcycling is a product of the ‘Empathize’ step of design thinking process, and it is meant to be one of the solutions to overcome the massive production of clothing and textile waste problem. Upcycling design process involves collecting used garments/textile, sourcing and analyzing materials collected, followed by the process of finding creative inspiration, moldboard creation, sketching, and production process. Unlike the standard/regular fashion designing process, upcycling processes create inspiration based on the materials and textiles available. It was observed that by following the design process, an efficient result can be achieved. Methods in upcycling the production process also play a crucial part. There are lots of ways to rework clothing, and we classify them into 4 methods, namely Subtraction method, Deconstruction method, Addition method, and Refunction method. From these 4 methods, subtraction is the easiest method to be used since it does not require any special tools (except laser cutting). Addition method is the richest method since it can be used by applying many creative techniques to the garment. There is a wide-ranging category of techniques that can be used in the upcycling process, such as cut, fold, patch and join, weave, color, and add. These various choices of techniques prove that the lifecycle of a garment can be lengthened by adding variations or deconstructing them. With upcycling, we can develop fashion industries with provision of upcycling methods and techniques skills training. Future research in the upcycling area can involve the consumers’ willingness to pay towards the upcycled garments, new methods and techniques, and the perceptions of the consumers towards the technique used in upcycling garment.","christabel annora paramita parung faculty of creative industries university of surabaya surabaya, indonesia christabelannora@staff.ubaya.ac.id viviany faculty of creative industries university of surabaya surabaya, indonesia viviany@staff.ubaya.ac.id gaymas vicka arda enantiomery fashion and lifestyle product design faculty of creative industries university of surabaya surabaya, indonesia genantiomery@gmail.com",

11,Total Cost Of Ownership Framework For Procurement Of  Buses Used In Public Transportation,"a study conducted on a public transport management system to deliver the best service with a defined standard of service from state regulatory bodies by utilizing & managing a high volume of vehicles in the most efficient, productive, and cost-effective way to minimize cost and as well as air pollution, carbon emissions from the transportation sector. a total cost of ownership framework is developed for evaluation of different alternative fuel bus options (diesel, electric and cng) based on real-world driving conditions. in addition, electric, cng, and diesel buses are compared from the life cycle and total cost of ownership (tco). according to the results, it was found that electric bus tco is less than the diesel and cng buses i.e. electric bus tco cost is 15% less than the diesel bus and in the case of cng, it is 5% less over a period of 10 years use. the proposed framework provides a quantitative basis for a sustainable fleet management approach for public bus service providers.",,", fuel cost is one of the most important factors for cost comparisons as it adds up the highest operation cost, a small drop in fuel efficiency will have a high impact on the TCO results, henceforth to achieve the best TCO a better fuel efficiency technology bus should be favored. Another factor that drives the high operation cost is vehicle maintenance and repair. According to the analysis results, he electric bus requires less maintenance as its total maintenance cost is $275,658, wherein for diesel and CNG is $305,758 and $364,916, respectively. When results were compared, it indicates that there is a 10% additional cost to maintain diesel fleet and 24% more for CNG bus compared to electric buses. Conventional diesel bus is the threshold for comparison considering that they are widely accepted technology and present transport operation fleet comprise of more than 90 % of diesel fleet and all the depot and workshop is well equipped with the purpose-built facility for maintenance of diesel buses. On the other hand, electrification needs a setup of a new infrastructure to support vehicle charging and electric bus maintenance same applies to CNG fleet also but the investment for CNG bus workshop is less as it needs relatively minor upgrade of the existing infrastructure compared to electric bus infrastructure requirement.

12,An Airport Gate Reassignment Model With Gate Disruptions,"in this study, we consider a gate reassignment problem that reassigns the set of aircraft to the set of gates. we assume the initial assignment plan—the so-called reference schedule—is known and there are disruptions at some particular gates where they become unavailable either for some specified time interval or from then on. hence, the initial assignment plan is rendered inefficient and even infeasible. following the disruption, the aircraft are reassigned to the gates or to the apron—an undesired remote gate. meanwhile, we are concerned with two measures: efficiency—which is obtaining a “good” plan, and stability—remaining faithful to the original plan. we apply hierarchical optimization for our efficiency and stability measures. for our efficiency measure, the primary objective is to minimize the number of apron assignments, whereas the secondary objective is to maximize the total number of passengers whose flights are assigned to the fixed gates. by doing so, the airport’s fixed gates are well- utilized with a higher priority, while also putting an emphasis on passenger satisfaction. for our stability measure, the primary aim is to minimize the deviation from the reference schedule in terms of the number of aircraft assigned to different gates, since a large-scale schedule change might be ill-favored or indeed problematic, whereas the secondary objective is to maximize the total number of aircraft assigned to the fixed gates among the ones that were originally assigned to apron in the reference schedule. if possible, we want to seize the chance of assigning a fixed gate to a previously ungated flight. we propose network flow based and assignment based mixed integer linear programming models to both get an initial assignment and a further reassignment under gate disruptions with our efficiency and stability concerns. using these mixed integer linear programming models, we make various trade-off analyses that would help the airport schedulers to cover their reference schedules with minimum cost and effort. our trade-off analyses include the development of solution algorithms favoring the following concerns: optimizing our efficiency measure while keeping the stability level at its minimum level, optimizing our stability measure while keeping the efficiency level at its minimum level and finding the set of non-dominated objective vectors with respect to our efficiency and stability measures. the results of our extensive experiments based on the layout data of the airports located in turkey have revealed the satisfactory performances of our algorithms used in the trade-off analyses.","efficiency measure, stability measure",,"dursen deniz poyraz and meral azizoğlu department of industrial engineering middle east technical university ankara, turkey dpoyraz@metu.edu.tr, ma@metu.edu.tr",
13,Social Networking: Strategies For Exploring Innovation In  The Indonesian Manufacturing Industry,"in indonesia, smes in the manufacturing sector are around 16.65 percent of the existing smes. the processing industry is a variety of production activities that change the form of raw materials into finished or semifinished goods. at this time, the covid-19 pandemic has resulted in smes in the processing industry being unable to survive only by exploiting existing businesses. changes in demand and supply chains, require the industry to explore new things while continuing to develop the business that is currently owned. this will be difficult for smes in indonesia, because in general, smes are family companies, with limited resources. to overcome the shortage of resources, smes need to collaborate with external partners and form social networks. this study uses a survey method to analyze the influence of networks on the competence of exploration in smes in the processing industry. from 100 respondents, it was found that social networking has a positive effect on the competence of exploring innovation. this happens because from social networks, smes can obtain additional resources, information, and new knowledge so that they can strengthen exploration competencies.","social networking, exploration, smes, 2020","The results showed that tie intensity affects exploration. This is based on the results of the hypothesis test where the P value of tie intensity to exploration is smaller than 0.05 which means that tie intensity has a significant effect on exploration. The results also showed that multiplexity affects exploration. This is based on the results of the hypothesis test where the P value of multiplexity to exploration is smaller than 0.05 which means that multiplexity has a significant effect on exploration. The ties intensity and the ties multiplexity of the company with external partners in the network had an effect on the exploration competence of the company. The intensity of a strong ties will provide additional resources so as to strengthen the organization's ability to explore new things (Granovetter, 2005; Indarti & Postma, 2013). The higher the multiplexity of ties with external partners, the more diverse information, knowledge, and experience will be, which will also increase exploration capabilities (Atuahene-Gima, 2005; Ikhsan et al., 2017). This shows that SMEs' exploration capabilities will be better if SMEs are willing to be open and cooperate with external parties to obtain additional information, knowledge, and resources (Ahuja, 2000). In order for SMEs to access resources from external partners, SMEs need to establish social networks and establish good relationships with partners.

14,Development Of An Airport Service Quality And Efficiency  Tool: A Comparison Based On Passenger Perceptions During,"this paper aims to develop an instrument based on passenger perception to measure and assess airport service quality (asq) and efficiency in the pre-pandemic and pandemic operations. first, the researchers analyzed literature to identify the dimensions incorporated into the survey instruments. many authors emphasized the importance of considering quality and efficiency in measuring airport service performance. thus, the dimensions of responsiveness, tangibles, reliability, and empathy were critical in passengers' perception of the quality and efficiency of airport services. then, a 56-item pre-pandemic and 32-item pandemic questionnaire was developed and was administered electronically to 100 respondents through convenience sampling. results were analyzed using descriptive statistics, clustering, and principal component analysis, proving that every dimension is essential for both operations. additionally, findings suggest that empathy and responsiveness are significant concerning passengers' perception of high service quality. this implies that passengers are keen on the quality-of-service delivery and their safety and well- being while availing of such services in the pre-pandemic and pandemic operations, respectively. thus, it is recommended for airport managers to focus on the mentioned dimensions to increase passenger satisfaction, quality, and efficiency of service delivery, even in post-pandemic operations.","responsiveness, empathy, servqual",,"pre-pandemic and pandemic operations richard c. li faculty of industrial and systems engineering department of industrial and systems engineering de la salle university - manila manila, philippines richard.li@dlsu.edu.ph justin christopher javelosa, endrei clyne mercullo, julian clement tan and trisha lauren to chip undergraduate student – industrial engineering department of industrial and systems engineering de la salle university - manila manila, philippines justin_javelosa@dlsu.edu.ph, endrei_mercullo@dlsu.edu.ph, julian_clement_tan@dlsu.edu.ph, trisha_tochip@dlsu.edu.ph",
15,Stock Market Efficiency An Information System Perspective  A Systematic Literature Review,"an efficient market provides price discovery and ensures all market participants are ensured a level playing field. the efficiency of stock markets has been studied over many decades, predominantly from a finance theory perspective. the study however, proposes to evaluate the issue of market efficiency from an information system perspective. information systems play a significant role in providing timely information with the ability to disseminate market information to all stakeholders worldwide, in an instant. after a systematic review of models evaluating performance of information systems throughput, the information success model was chosen and then adapted to suit the requirements of the study. human behavioral components such as herding behavior, intention to utilize information/systems, user satisfaction, and other criteria such as information quality, system quality and service quality which all play a crucial role in making not just information systems efficient but also financial markets efficient, were linked to provide the study's conceptual framework designed to explore the effects of information systems on stock market behavior.",market efficiency,". The idea is to use a logical, thoughtful approach to decision-making rather than a reflexive, impulsive approach. It is apparent that mere informational efficiency as discussed in the Efficient Market Hypothesis doesn’t give a full picture of market efficiency and therefore the need to take into account behavioral aspects of market participants if we are to fully explain the concept. No matter how informationally efficient a market is, psychological phenomena of investors also plays a key role in that. In this study the main objective is to open up a discussion in the world of finance, that the impacts of technology also should be integrated in the effort of explaining market efficiency. As a preliminary effort we chose Information Systems, more specifically the impact from the trading information systems to market efficiency with the expectation of opening up a new revolutionary aspect to financial market efficiency. Market Efficiency and Information Systems Efficiency Trading activities and informational intensity in a trading floor form a fairly complex environment [Weber, 1993]. “Financial markets are probably the most competitive, dynamic and complex of all markets.” [Almanza et al, 2016]. Information technology plays a crucial role in improving the efficiency of trading activities by utilizing its features through real time data services and analytical tools. Advancement in technology has produced this new arena of Financial Engineering which transforms the financial instruments, altered to investor requirements, (Weber, 1993). The financial world has seen regulatory and market barriers collapsing, automation continuing to restructure trade processes, and cutting the costs of transacting and monitoring financial markets. In financial markets, observers have announced ""The End of Geography"". Location plays a greatly diminished role in investors' decisions. Global market integration is accelerating, and globalization is no longer merely a buzzword; it has arrived. It is not uncommon to hear of a British broker working with US employees to place orders on Japanese equities. The investor can use a screen-based market to hedge against the risk of adverse changes in currency values or interest rates, such as Globex. Such activities provide benefits through increased investor diversification, lower costs of company funding and increased competition across market participants. Features of the trading systems being used today had been foretold in a landmark paper, “Information Technology in the Major International Financial Markets in the World”, (Weber, 1993). These are some interesting predictions that were made which can now be experienced today even on a more improved scale: Information Systems act as an order collector in the process of processing trading instructions, once a trading order is entered to the system order details such as limit price, quantity, time etc are accessible for an investor’s management and measurement purpose, price determination is governed by Information Systems which aggregate the information about orders submitted to the stock market, order execution is done by the system and the order confirmation is routed electronically to the users, systems are used to share market information in a wider scale, systems are used for reporting and monitoring purposes of trading activities (Weber, 1993). Gomber et al (2018) states that the interdisciplinary space of the Fintech revolution is taken over by the technology transformation of banking, securities trading, and other financial services which encompasses new service visions and client centricity, with promising cost-control and profitability prospects, which also concludes the impact of technology to the world of financial instruments. Now it’s very clear that there is an overlap between financial markets and information systems. Thus we can understand that how well the information system is utilized can have an immense impact on how well functioning or malfunctioning a financial market is. Let’s deep dive into the previous work on efficiency of Information Systems. DeLone et al, (2016) conclude in their study that system quality, information quality, service quality, intention to use, use, user satisfaction and net impacts, as individual success variables in measuring the efficiency of information systems. Systems quality is the desirable characteristics of an information system. Information quality is the desirable characteristics of the system outputs. Service quality is the quality of the support users receive from the organization’s information systems. Use is defined as the degree and manner in which users utilize the capabilities of an information system. User satisfaction is the level of user satisfaction with a system's output. “With increased use of a system, problems come to light and possible improvements are recognized, leading to Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management Istanbul, Turkey, March 7-10, 2022 IEOM Society International 115","malithi thudewatta and suren peter department of industrial management faculty of science university of kelaniya sri lanka malithi.personal@icloud.com,","References

17,Bibliometric Analysis Of Publications Related To The  Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Before And After The Covid-19,"the pharmaceutical industry has undergone changes in the management of its logistics processes, making it vulnerable to disruptions such as the covid-19 pandemic. this study compares the scientific production on the pharmaceutical chain during the period 2010-2021, divided into two periods, through a bibliometric review of research indexed in scopus and web of science. the main authors, institutions, countries, journals and thematic areas are identified, and the studies of greatest scientific relevance are analyzed. the vosviewer tool is used to visualize the relationships between authors and between",drug chain,"Science and research on the pharmaceutical sector are important for the development of a country, which is reflected in the technological advancement of this industry in nations such as the USA. This study was able to identify and show the differences in scientific research on the pharmaceutical supply chain before and after the pandemic in internationally recognized databases. It showed that the number of publications on this industry has been increasing and is expected to continue to do so in the coming years; however, there is no evidence of a large number of publications linking the pharmaceutical supply chain to Covid-19. It is shown that the research published in each period shows a different approach that is in line with the current trends or situations that are being experienced. Likewise, the participation of institutions from Iran, Morocco and Saudi Arabia in this field of research in the last 11 years stands out.","pandemic in the period 2010-2021 sovero castro lucia isabel facultad de ingeniería y arquitectura carrera de ingenieria industrial universidad de lima lima, peru 20162558@aloe.ulima.edu.pe risco guevara fabiola milagros facultad de ingeniería y arquitectura carrera de ingenieria industrial universidad de lima lima, peru 20171310@aloe.ulima.edu.pe garcia-lopez yvan jesus facultad de ingeniería y arquitectura carrera de ingenieria industrial universidad de lima lima, peru ygarcia@ulima.edu.pe",
18,Omni-Channel Fulfillment Models,"the advancement of technology has changed the ways customers interact with retailers. customers are now empowered with more choices than ever before. for instance, they can choose how to place their orders (e.g., online, in store) and can also choose where they would like to receive the products (e.g., at home, in store). omni-channel retailing is a recent approach that allows customers to purchase products from anywhere and return them anywhere and allows retailers to fulfill orders from anywhere. this flexibility offered by omni-channel retailing improves the customer experience by integrating all channels, allows retailers to achieve more availability and drives the sales and traffic of the retailers. however, it also puts extremely high pressure on retailers to align their operations in an efficient manner and to get products faster to customers. two omni-channel fulfillment implementations that can offer benefit for the retailers are ship-from-store and home delivery. ship-from-store allows retailers to fulfill online orders from brick- and-mortar stores, rather than from fulfillment centers (fcs). home delivery allows customers to place their orders in store and receive them at home. customers now use various sales channels including traditional store visits, websites, mobile-phone apps in their purchase processes. as a result, retailers are challenged with customers who are prone to switch across the retailers’ sales channels. ideally, omni-channel retailing, described as a retailer’s efforts to provide customers a consistent, coordinated shopping experience across all available shopping channels, should enable customers to shop in a seamless manner across the channels. although the current practice is far from the ideal, firms need to consider the impact of customer switching behavior on their profits. in this study, we build a discrete time dynamic programming model to investigate the optimal order fulfillment policies for the retailers using omni-channel implementations (namely, ship- from-store and home delivery). store customers can be fulfilled in store or they can ask for a home delivery. online orders, on the other hand, can be shipped either from the fulfillment center or from any other store location that maximizes the overall profit of the retailer. we incorporate the uncertainty both in demand and in the cost of shipment to individual customers. we further consider that both store and online customers can switch across the sales channels. through computational studies, we compare several scenarios to analyze the impact of offering cross-channel fulfillment implementations and inventory scarcity levels of locations on the retailers’ profit.","retail operations, ship-from-store, turkey",,"bahriye cesaret assistant professor of operations management faculty of business ozyegin university istanbul, turkey bahriye.cesaret@ozyegin.edu.tr armagan bayram assistant professor of industrial engineering college of engineering & computer science university of michigan at dearborn dearborn, michigan, usa armagan@umich.edu",
19,It Service Level Optimization: A Case Study,"over years, information technology (it) has been a fundamental success factor by its contribution to the efficiency, profitability, and growth for enterprises. in time, it has become a strategic partner of companies. as a consequence, the role of it has evolved and organizations have become to see it as a part of business rather than a separate unit. thus, it services have to function continually to make enterprises reach their business goals. however, it services’ working uninterruptedly is almost impossible due to many constraints (i.e. hardware and software requirements, budget etc.) and strict working conditions in the digitalized age (i.e. working 24 hours a day and 7 days a week, rapid change, complexity etc.). therefore, there is a need for optimizing it services’ availability. this study suggests a new methodology to meet this requirement. for this aim, after preparing an efficient it service catalog and determining right relationships between services, it service level is optimized by means of a new mathematical model. moreover, the proposed method is applied with both random instances and a real case study of a big turkish it company serving to a finance group. it is analyzed that the proposed method provides efficient service level.","service management, mathematical model","and Further Research This paper presents a new methodology to optimize the performance of IT services. The study proposes to prepare an efficient IT service catalog and determine right relationships between services as it is expected in service design area of ITIL which is the most popular and accepted IT service management framework. Moreover, this paper integrates ITIL requirements with a novel mathematical model to optimize IT service level. The proposed mathematical model provides IT professionals with fundamental opportunities such as considering the criticality, value, and downtime of each service based on agreements made with the customers. It is surprising that although there are many ITSM frameworks and standards, IT organizations still have issues with measuring and optimizing service performance. Therefore, researchers and IT professionals need to find new ways of optimizing level of IT services. Although the studies about IT service management is rich, our contribution which is the performance optimization of IT services with the help of ITIL processes and mathematical modelling has not been studied in the literature. In this study, after applying our proposed methodology with 50 random instances, we implement it in a big Turkish IT company, and observe that the proposed method provides successful results. The results of both random instances and case study demonstrate that the solution time is acceptable with the working period of services considered in hours in the mathematical model. Results related to the availability of services in the case study are also appreciated by IT executives and top managers depending on the service continuity and strategy in the company. Future studies may focus on solving the problem in shorter period of time (e.g. in minutes or seconds instead of hours) as an unavoidable fact in the digitalized age. In this case, the problem cannot be solved optimally in the reasonable time. Thus, we may need to develop an efficient metaheuristic to solve the same problem this time with higher number of variables.","ayfer basar industrial engineering management faculty istanbul technical university istanbul, turkey ayferbasar@gmail.com, basara@itu.edu.tr",
20,High Performance Dc-Dc Buck Converter Based On   Sliding Mode Control,"the quality of power conversion represents an important constraint in designing the dc-dc converter for distributed generation (dg) application based on renewable and clean energies. from this point of fact, this paper introduces a full modelling and design steps for a suitable dc-dc buck converter which controlled by a flexible designed sliding mode controller (smc). firstly, analyzing, modelling of a buck converter working through a continuous conduction mode (ccm) operation, and collecting the dynamic equations, all are demonstrated in this study. then, to guarantee a high performance of power conversion function, a new comprehensive steps design of an effective sm controller has proposed to integrate the converter function. the proposed converter with the smc controller are simulated and tested using simulink of matlab software. the collected simulation results of resistive load voltage, current, and power are harvested for different load levels with varying the input dc link voltage. the shape and levels of load testing parameters through source voltage and load variation are promising and confirming the quality and the effectiveness of the presented converter and controller.","buck converter, simulation","and Future Work A new design of a robust sliding mode controller for buck converter has presented in this paper; the design has started by determining the dynamic equations of the inductor current and output voltage of the converter through modeling it in continuous current operation mode.

27,Certification Of Tourism Business Standards And Chse  Standards In Indonesia,"both globally and locally, tourism is a key driver of economic growth. the government's proactive role strongly supports tourism growth that benefits both the economy and all parties. standard development, implementation, and certification programs are critical in this sector to increase competitiveness. the purpose of this paper is to explore policies for implementing standards and tourism business certification programs. in indonesia, responding to the demands of the era of globalization, the government issued a policy of implementing standards and certification for tourism businesses. however, the inadequate response of business actors has caused the growth in the number of certified business actors to be disproportionate to the number of available tourism businesses. the benefits of certification have yet to be recognized, and the cost of certification carried by tourism businesses is a factor that influences certification decisions. in contrast, a different condition in chse certification policy (cleanliness, health, safety, and environmental sustainability), which the government also issued in 2020 in response to the covid-19 pandemic. the number growth of certified tourism businesses shows the government's precision in responding to actual conditions; for this reason, necessary to review policies as considerations in formulating and issuing policies that bring more benefits.","chse (cleanliness, health, safety",,"ari nugraheni, rahmat nurcahyo, and djoko sihono gabriel industrial engineering department, faculty of engineering universitas indonesia kampus ui, depok, 16424, indonesia ari.nugraheni@gmail.com, rahmat@eng.ui.ac.id, dsihono@gmail.com","References

29,Multi-Objective Optimization Model For An Integrated  Disassembly Line Balancing And Green Vehicle Routing,"today, serious environmental problems arise with overconsumption. to obtain maximum benefit from the recycling activities depends on the effective and robust design of the disassembly lines. in addition to this, the distribution plan of products to be recycled is as important as the disassembly process. therefore, it is important to handle these two problems simultaneously. this paper includes the integrated optimization of the disassembly line balancing problem and the multi-objective green vehicle routing problem for the first time. the integrated problem is formulated as a multi-objective mixed integer linear programming. the objectives of the model consist of minimization of total co2 emission and minimization of the total cost. this proposed model could provide to decision makers flexible solutions for simultaneous optimization regarding environmental and economic aspect by considering potential situations that take into account in supply chain management and help to make strategic decisions as well.",,"With increasing consumption amount continuously, recycling is gaining more and more importance. For this reason, disassembly, which is one of the most important stages of recycling, comes to the fore. After the disassembly process, planning the distribution of the obtained components is also very important for supply chain companies. It is thought that modelling and solving complex optimization problems can provide significant benefits to such decision makers.

36,Evaluation Of Third-Party Reverse Logistics Providers Using  Fuzzy Axiomatic Design,"there is a dramatic increase in the amount of product returns mainly due to rapid technological developments and more liberal return policies. this has increased the importance of the reverse logistics which involves the collection and either recovery or disposal of returned products. many companies outsource their reverse logistics operations to third-party reverse logistics providers in order to ensure the cost-effective management of product returns. hence successful implementation of third-party reverse logistics highly depends on the systematic evaluation of alternative third-party reverse logistics providers. in this study, a novel third-party reverse logistics provider evaluation methodology based on fuzzy axiomatic design is proposed. a numerical example is also provided in order to illustrate the applicability of the proposed approach.",,"Outsourcing of reverse logistics operations to 3PRLPs is a strategy followed by many companies in order to deal with the increased amount of product returns. The successful implementation of this strategy largely depends on the performance of the selected 3PRLP and performance evaluation of 3PRLPs requires linguistic assessments provided by decision makers. Hence, there is a need for the development of 3PRLP selection approaches that can handle the uncertainty associated with linguistic assessments. In this study, FAHP and FAD techniques are integrated in order to develop a 3PRLP evaluation approach that can deal with the linguistic assessments provided by decision makers. The applicability of the proposed approach is tested by applying it to a numerical example.","mehmet ali ilgin associate professor of industrial engineering faculty of engineering manisa celal bayar university manisa, turkey mehmetali.ilgin@cbu.edu.tr",

We analyzed three different strategic models, related to the timing of decisions. When the two hotels decide simultaneously, the CSR hotel sets a lower price than the FP hotel. Furthermore, when the CSR hotel’s preference for consumer surplus is small (resp., large), CSR hotel earns higher (resp., lower) profits than the FP hotel. If the CSR hotel sets the price before the FP hotel, it will be at an advantage, in the sense that it achieves higher profits, when the CSR hotel’s preference for consumer surplus is neither too large nor too small; and it will be at a disadvantage, when the CSR hotel’s preference for consumer surplus is either small or large.

39,Agricultural Mechanization In Indonesia And Comparison To  Southeast Asia Countries,"agricultural mechanization refers to the use of modern technologies to mechanize agricultural activities, greatly increasing the efficiency of agricultural workers. in this age, modern technologies have replaced many agricultural activities that were previously carried out by human or draft animal workers. indonesia is a country with the largest area in southeast asia, so it has the potential to optimize its agricultural sector. in 2019, indonesia's agricultural land area reached more than 15 million. this research wants to compare the status of mechanization level, government policies, economic conditions of indonesia with other countries in southeast asia. data collection was gathered by conducting literature reviews such as journals, references, and supporting libraries, and institutions. mechanization level is the ratio between the amount of power (hp) of agriculture machinery with the area of agriculture. the mechanization level from indonesia grew from 1968 which was only 1.173 hp/ha to 1.68 in 2018. indonesia's mechanization level is indeed higher when compared to vietnam, cambodia, and the philippines. however, the mechanization level of indonesia is still below thailand and malaysia, so there needs to be a strategy to improve it. through the procurement policy of 1 million agriculture machinery carried out by the indonesian government, it is expected to improve the quality of production in the agricultural sector. in addition, indonesia needs to improve management, improving the quality of the workforce and regulations related to agriculture.","level mechanization, agriculture, indonesia","Mechanization has a huge impact on the development of agriculture and farmers' livelihoods in Asia. In different regions of Asia, as well as in the different regions of the same country, there is a gap in agricultural mechanization due to the lack of transfer of technology and testing standards. The development of mechanization in Asia is necessary for the development of agriculture and the growing demand for food in the region. Indonesia is a country with the largest area in Southeast Asia, so it has the potential to optimize its agricultural sector. Mechanization level Indonesia is still below Thailand and Malaysia, so there needs to be a strategy to improve it. Through the procurement policy of 1 million agriculture machinery carried out by the Indonesian government, it is expected to improve the quality of production in the agricultural sector. In addition, there is also a need to improve management, improving the quality of workforce and regulations related to agriculture.","adhyka wijaya, rahmat nurcahyo industrial engineering department, faculty of engineering universitas indonesia depok, west java, indonesia adhyka.wijaya@ui.ac.id , rahmat@eng.ui.ac.id",
40,Analysis Of The Effect Of Workload On Work Stress Level In  Indonesia Manufacturing Industry,"indonesia's manufacturing industry is the backbone of national economic growth. the requirement of production targets to maintain customer satisfaction leads to a higher workload at any given time. in the manufacturing industry, organisations have divisions according to their business functions, namely core and non-core. each division has its workload and function. the workload determines the work stress risk level. so the researchers will do survey research on the influence of sources of stress on the level of work stress risk in each division with a study case of a manufacturing industry employee. the causes of stress based on indonesia minister of manpower regulation no. 5 of 2018 are role clarity, role conflict, quantitative workload, qualitative workload, career development, and responsibility to others. then researcher examined using analysis of variance (anova), it was found that there was no difference between core and non-core functions in work stress risk level.",,"Analysis related to the influence of sources of stress on the level of work stress risk found that all divisions in a manufacturing industry experienced medium work stress risk. Stress causes include role clarity, role conflict, quantitative workload, qualitative workload, career development, and responsibility to others. Furthermore, the most source of stress is qualitative workload. The researcher also found no relationship between work stress risk level and core and non-core division functions in the manufacturing industry in Indonesia. Further research needs to reduce stress on employees in the manufacturing industry and make productivity improvements in the company. So that if the labor can minimize the source of stress, then The least stress labor can achieve the company's productivity because employee performance is not disturbed due to stress.","timotius candra kusuma department of industrial engineering, universitas indonesia, depok 16424, indonesia timotius.candra@ui.ac.id rahmat nurcahyo professor in industrial engineering department of industrial engineering, universitas indonesia, depok 16424, indonesia rahmat@eng.ui.ac.id m dachyar professor in industrial engineering department of industrial engineering, universitas indonesia, depok 16424, indonesia mdachyar@eng.ui.ac.id",
41,"Policy, Supporting Infrastructure And Market Of Electric  Cars In Indonesia","the zero-emission transportation target has driven the development and adoption of electric vehicles (ev) across the globe, including indonesia. this policy aims to reduce greenhouse gas and fossil fuel use. indonesia is one of the countries with the most significant automotive development in asean. this condition also makes the electric cars market in indonesia has enormous potential. this research will discuss the trend of electric cars in indonesia, including the policy, technology, supporting infrastructure, and electric cars market in indonesia. based on presidential regulation no. 55 of 2019 concerning the acceleration of the battery electric vehicle program for road transportation, the government encourages the development of the electric car technology industry. the government encourages electric car technology by providing incentives to consumers and manufacturers. the government has also built quality 148 public electric vehicle charging stations (pevcs) and 39 standards related to electric cars. sales of electric cars in indonesia increased 74,18% in 2020 and 52,61% in mid-2021. in this study, we found that the challenge for electric cars in indonesia is the lack of charging station infrastructure and standards related to electric cars. the government's program to encourage electric cars in indonesia is achieved. a complete and integrated intelligent transportation management system is needed where all entities are aware of the efficient use of energy to create sustainable transportation. the integration of transportation management systems is not possible without the cooperation and collaboration of car manufacturers, scientists, power companies, governments, and standards organizations.","ev policy, ev infrastructure, ev technology","The government has issued many regulations for the development of national electric vehicles. The Government has also set a roadmap for developing the electric vehicle industry and its main components. The challenge for electric cars in Indonesia is lack of charging station infrastructure and standards related to electric cars. Besides, Indonesia also faces significant challenges in ensuring the power generation and energy management needed for electric car consumption. Electric cars have a short driving capacity and relatively short distances compared to conventional cars (Brady and O'Mahony, 2016). For this reason, a charging network is needed in many vehicle charging stations. The most significant challenge compared to producing affordable batteries is constructing a charging infrastructure on a national scale. Another challenge is the need for universal standards and regulations for the electric facility and electric car market (Ruiz et al. 2018). Each developed country has different standards related to electric cars, for example, the standard of electric energy utility for variations in steering patterns/driving cycles (Brady and O'Mahony, 2016), design standards for the battery management system (Hauser and Kuhn, 2015), electric charging standards integrated with electric vehicle regulations (Shaukat et al. 2018), spare parts (Habib et al. 2015), and as well as a standard platform for electrical infrastructure to protect consumers (Ahmad et al. 2018). For the government's program to encourage the use of electric cars in Indonesia to be achieved, a complete and integrated intelligent transportation management system is needed. All entities are aware of the efficient use of energy to create sustainable transportation. The integration of transportation management systems is not possible without the cooperation and collaboration of car manufacturers, scientists, power companies, governments, and standards organizations (Mehar et al. 2015). 705 1228 1874 0 500 1000 1500 2000 2019 2020 Jan to July 2021 QUANTITY (IN UNIT) Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management Istanbul, Turkey, March 7-10, 2022 IEOM Society International 370","ajun tri setyoko, rahmat nurcahyo, djoko sihono gabriel, muhammad habiburrahman department of industrial engineering faculty of engineering universitas indonesia depok 16424, indonesia ajuntrisetyoko@gmail.com, rahmat@eng.ui.ac.id, dsihono@gmail.com, @m.habib.st@gmail.com","References

44,A Survey Of Maintenance Management Systems In Indonesia  Primary School Institutions,"maintenance considerations are essential for school facilities in achieving educational functions. in particular, the maintenance of school facilities is crucial in maintaining the operation of all building systems and components. it is a facility in creating an effective teaching and learning process by providing an environment conducive to learning and academic success. the maintenance of facilities in schools is related to things that are considered as facilities and infrastructure as stipulated in the regulation of the minister of national education no. 24 of 2007. defines facilities as a piece of transferable learning equipment, with minimum facilities consisting of furniture, educational equipment, educational media, books, other learning resources, information and communication technology, and other equipment that every school/madrasah must own. meanwhile, infrastructure is defined as basic facilities to carry out school/madrasah functions, with minimum infrastructure criteria consisting of land, buildings, space, electrical power installations, and services that every school/madrasah must own. the above facilities and infrastructures show the characteristics of a primary school. this study aims to identify the primary school characteristics and the maintenance management system implemented in most of the schools in the area. the survey results show that most primary schools in jabodetabek already have a maintenance management system implemented following the preventive maintenance criteria that we set in this study.",,"In response to the several preventive maintenance questions, most primary schools in Jabodetabek have such a scheme. This characteristic is a critical factor in the maintenance system that can significantly improve the performance of facilities and infrastructure in schools. This paper recommends that top management of schools pay attention to these characteristics when planning and implementing maintenance so that maintenance and effectiveness of activities can be improved and achieved. Good facilities and infrastructure condition is the responsibility of all parties in the school. A good coordination and communication platform is recommended to involve all teachers, employees, students, maintenance personnel, and building users in planning and implementation maintenance in schools. Schools must have a long-term plan to meet the changing conditions of their facilities. Long-term planning is an integral part of school operations. It needs to be updated regularly to keep up with changing conditions of the facilities in the surrounding environment adapting to regional autonomy policies. This condition has a direct impact on the teaching and learning process, it is very important for schools to provide a healthy learning experience for quality education. (Au-Yong et al., 2014).

53,Analysis Of Customer Satisfaction Level In Accredited  Laboratory Testing Iso/Iec 17025 Before And After,"the massive and rapid spread of covid-19 has prompted almost all government to implement social distancing, lockdown, and even to impose temporary closures on several sectors. many service sectors felt a significant impact due to this pandemic, one of them is accredited laboratory testing. maintaining customer satisfaction seems to be difficult due to the change of the way people interact each other caused by the pandemic. it was a new challenge for the laboratory to maintain their customer satisfaction. this study takes cmpfa laboratory as the object of case study which aims to analyze customer satisfaction in accredited laboratory testing industry before and after pandemic covid-19 occurred. through this study, it is found that cmpfa laboratory testing succeed in increasing customer satisfaction in every dimension of the service. it happened due to the right strategy that implemented by cmpfa during pandemic covid-19. descriptive statistic was used to understand and analyze the data. therefore, this study helps the laboratories to evaluate and understand the effect of pandemic on customer satisfaction and the strategy that implemented to maintain their satisfaction during pandemic covid-19.","service quality, lockdown","Average of customer satisfaction score in CMPFA increased from 4.3 in 2019 to 4.5 in 2020. This increase even occurred in every dimension of service provided by CMPFA to its customers. It was recorded that in 2019, several service dimensions such as completion time of testing, communication during the test, delivery of information and conformance on customer requests still had 0.2-0.4% of customers with less satisfied levels. However, based on a survey conducted in 2020, the satisfaction level of less satisfied customers were no longer found. In addition, the percentage of highly satisfied levels has increased from 2019 to 2020. In 2020, the percentage of customers who are at the highly satisfied level is more than 50% in each service dimension. This shows that CMPFA is able to improve the quality of its services and is able to understand the customer need well, especially in facing new challenges due to Covid-19. CMPFA continues to improve service quality in order to continue to improve customer satisfaction. One of the strategies used is to carry out a personal approach procedure. This has a good effect on customer satisfaction. This result only focus on CMPFA as one of an accredited laboratory testing. Therefore, there might be some differences strategic, goals, and the evaluated item of service. Extensive study which focus on understanding and identifying gap between customer expectation and perceived value in accredited laboratory testing might be conducted to understand deeply about customer need.","pandemic covid-19 occurred: a case study muhammad y salam, rahmat nurcahyo, djoko s gabriel industrial engineering department, faculty of engineering universitas indonesia depok, west java, indonesia muhammad.yaasiin01@ui.ac.id, rahmat@eng.ui.ac.id, dsihono@gmail.com",
54,Preventive Maintenance Practices Survey  In Hospital Laboratories In Jakarta,"during the covid-19 pandemic, the suitability of the results of a health test is an important note in order to stay healthy and carry out activities in the midst of a pandemic. measuring a health test can be carried out properly and accurately in a laboratory whose measurement tools are regularly maintained, the results of this health test can be used by consumers to determine the condition of the body and what steps must be taken to get further medical action, in this study we investigated about both internal and external factors from recalibration of medical laboratory equipment as a form of maintenance to obtain appropriate results. with reference to the answers obtained using the likert scale, we hope that the data we convey is more objective and closer to the truth, what our fgd is to find out what factors, both internally and externally, have the most significant impact on the maintenance and recalibration of health measuring instruments, then do a mapping with swot to draw conclusions on our research.",survey,"The top 5 based on questions on each Preventive Maintenance factor in Hospital Laboratories include Control (80.6%), Do not use expired/damaged reagents (77.4%), Checking reagent expiration date (71%), Daily running control (67.7%), and Check list of tool performance checks (64.5%). From the SWOT Matrix can be seen that Hospital Laboratories can use the WO (Weakness - Opportunity) strategy to strengthen their performance. Preventive maintenance can be applied properly in the laboratory if it is accompanied by a strategy that has been analyzed using the SWOT matrix, namely briefing, checking equipment that does not require daily maintenance, paying more attention to the placement of hazardous reagents, for technical analysts for medical laboratories to increase skills in treating and replacing spare parts of damaged laboratory equipment and increase awareness to remain responsible and thorough and careful in working, for laboratory coordinators to evaluate activities and improve cooperation in the laboratory. To prevent errors in testing, a preventive maintenance is needed that can continue to maintain accuracy for medical devices that will be used in providing an overview of the health condition of consumers as a","indonesia clara puspita n, gandi henra laksana b, m. fauzan, lutfiani department of industrial engineering, faculty of engineering universitas indonesia, kampus ui depok, indonesia clara.puspita01@ui.ac.id,gandi.henra@ui.ac.id,lutfiani@ui.ac.id,muhammad.fauzan03@ui.ac.id",
55,Materiality Of Supplier Sustainability Assessment For Buyer  Companies,"in the challenging path to a sustainable organization, considering only internal operations is not enough. as the common saying notes “you are only as good as the company you keep”. hence, companies should pay attention to the sustainability of their business partners, suppliers coming in the first place. given that, this paper addresses the priority attached to supplier sustainability assessment (ssa) by buyer companies headquartered in many different countries. it investigates the priority of ssa for buyers among other sustainability strategies and the factors that influence this strategy. the paper considers ssa on four different sustainability dimensions and focuses on the variations among these dimensions. the impacts of both country- and company-level factors are analyzed on each dimension. the study uses secondary data from both company sources (sustainability and annual reports) and independent databases (e.g. world economic forum, oecd, djs indices). the analysis conducted through permutation and mann whitney u tests, has shown that regulatory environment and sustainability orientation of companies have strong associations with the strategic priority attached to ssa particularly on human rights and social impact. the variation of the factor impacts among dimensions is particularly noteworthy: while no impact is observed for more traditional dimensions (e.g. environment, labor practices), there exist significant and strong impacts on relatively newer dimensions. the findings have important implications for both companies and policy makers: priority put on ssa only on human rights and social impact may serve as distinctive features and generate competitive advantage for sustainability reporting companies, for other dimensions the same impact is not possible. by improving regulatory environment (i.e. regulatory enforcement), policy makers may promote ssa only on human rights and social impact, not on other dimensions.","materiality, secondary data",,"öznur özdemir-akyıldırım associate professor of operations management faculty of economics and administrative sciences akdeniz university antalya, turkey oozdemirak@akdeniz.edu.tr",
56,Customized Vacuum Valve Developed By Multi-Material  3D-Printed Processes For Carbon Fiber Lamination,"3d printing technologies are proving to be an increasingly useful tool not only for the creation of prototypes, but also of finished components. 3d printing has become a mature technology able to product finished objects and non finished parts intended to support the production. this is possible because of the continuous innovation in materials that are now able to achieve specific requests. moreover the lowering of the hardware’s costs played a central role in the expansion of 3d printing technology. another important aspect of 3d printing processes is in fact their application within the production process of other components, for example, by considering less inexpensive technologies such as fdm and msla. the goal of this research is to take advantage of the great variety that 3d printing offers in order to implement this process across different mechanical and prototyping applications to emphasize the importance of spreading this technology. this is achieved studying specific application.","3d printing, fdm, msla, vacuum valve","This study showed how 3D printing can be revolutionary not only to create finished components, but also to integrate within the manufacturing process of other parts. In this case study, the fabrication of a valve useful for producing carbon fiber components through vacuum technology was discussed. The ability to print the component independently demonstrated how versatile 3D printing technology can be. The combination of FDM and MSLA technologies could help to customize parts for better efficiency, especially on different geometries. A future development would be characterizing the materials used to reduce waste due to support and testing of finished components. This final step should be performed in order to adopt polymer’s 3D printing as replacement for metal components.","patrich ferretti, gian maria santi, christian leon-cardenas, giulia alessandri, merve sali, and marco freddi department of industrial engineering alma mater studiorum university of bologna viale risorgimento, 2 – 40136, bologna, italy patrich.ferretti2@unibo.it, gianmaria.santi2@unibo.it, christian.leon2@unibo.it, giulia.alessandri5@unibo.it, merve.sali2@unibo.it, marco.freddi@studio.unibo.it",

62,The Impact Of Supply Chain Disclosure On Supplier  Sustainability: A Qualitative Analysis In The Textile Industry,"this study aims to investigate the impact of supply chain disclosure on supplier sustainability. after the unfortunate rana plaza event in bangladesh and due to increasing stakeholder pressure, global textile and apparel retailers started to share more information about how they ensure sustainability in their supply chains. one of these practices is publicly sharing supplier lists, which include supplier information such as location, employee size and gender, product type and audit reports. extant research has focused on understanding the impact of sharing supplier lists on customer buying behavior and buying firm profitability; however, the effect on supplier sustainability has not been investigated yet. this is surprising considering that the ultimate purpose of supply chain disclosure is improving supply chain sustainability. to investigate this research gap, in this study a qualitative approach is adopted, and interviews with turkish textile firms listed in such lists are conducted. exploratory analyses illustrate varying effects on supplier sustainability behavior as well as the barriers and enablers for these effects. implications for theory and practice are discussed.","sustainability, textile",,"melek akın ateş assistant professor of purchasing & supply management sabanci business school, sabanci university istanbul, turkey melek.ates@sabanciuniv.edu",
63,Sustainability In The Textile Industry: A Quantitative  Analysis Of The Role Of Supply Chain Disclosure And Supply,"sustainability has become an important issue on corporate agendas and firms are increasingly being held responsible for not only their own actions, but also the actions of other firms in the supply chain. in line with this, firms aiming to be more transparent about their sustainability practices started to voluntarily reveal their supplier lists to the public, which might include information such as the company name, product type, location, factory demographics (e.g. gender distribution, firm size), audit reports and sustainability grading of suppliers. this exploratory study aims to investigate the impact of the extent of supply chain disclosure on firm performance, by focusing on the textile industry. the role of supply chain complexity as an antecedent of supply chain disclosure is also examined by focusing on its two dimensions: horizontal complexity (i.e. the number of suppliers) and spatial complexity (i.e. geographical spread of suppliers). data is collected from secondary sources using supplier lists published on company websites and orbis database. hypotheses are tested via hierarchical regression analysis. the results suggest that supply chain disclosure has a positive impact on financial performance. the findings also indicate that supply chain complexity has a negative impact on the extent of supply chain disclosure.","sustainability, textile",,"chain complexity melek akın ateş assistant professor of purchasing & supply management sabanci business school, sabanci university istanbul, turkey melek.ates@sabanciuniv.edu",
64,Improving Firm Performance Through  Knowledge Management And Open Innovation,"this research examines the relationship between knowledge management and open innovation on firm performance. the company's performance results from measuring the operational and financial performance. in this pandemic, the performance of the national shipping industry is quite a under pressure due to the existence of regulations for the compliance of restrictions on community activities (ppkm). for this reason, this study aims to find out how knowledge management and open innovation influence the performance of companies in indonesia. the research was conducted in 2020, and the scope of this research is 126 indonesian companies engaged in the shipping industry. the research method used is quantitative with descriptive and inferential statistical data analysis techniques, namely, regression analysis. the results obtained indicate that knowledge management and open innovation positively influence the company's performance. it reinforces that knowledge management and open innovation impact company performance to pay special attention to the development of knowledge and innovation of employees.",firm performance,"The independent variable knowledge management (X1) has a significant effect on the company's performance (Y). The regression coefficient shows that the knowledge management with a positive value can be interpreted that the increase in the direction of knowledge owned by the company will increase the value of the company's performance. The knowledge management that has been implemented has had a positive impact by increasing employees' knowledge, skills, and abilities and training in soft skills to enhance leadership programs to create new leaders who can support and improve the company's performance. The independent variable open innovation (X2) significantly affects company performance (Y). It can be interpreted that open innovation can improve the company's performance. Open innovation is changing or creating more effective processes, products, and ideas. The main reason why companies innovate is to improve company performance, increasing the capacity of the production process to develop new products and new practices in the organization that can increase the company's ability to acquire and create new knowledge that is they can use to create other innovations. According to the results, most open innovation techniques are prone to declining marginal returns on the performance of industrial and economic innovations. Furthermore, external search breadth is inversely related to all measures of innovation performance; coupled OI is inversely associated with the development and commercialization of radical innovations; shallow search depth is not subject to diminishing marginal returns in most cases, except industrial innovation performance from incremental innovations. In addition, coupled OI is inversely related to the development and commercialization of radical innovations.

71,Determining The Type Of Maintenance By Using Multiattribute Utility Theory,"printing industry is one of business that categorized in production sector which required support utility ie photocopy machine and printer in well condition. maintenance activities are generally considered as supporting activities in the production process. however, this activity is very important because it contributes directly to the smooth running of the production process and productivity. the purpose of this paper is to guide the use of decision-making techniques in selecting some important criterion in the most trending of maintenance strategy for small and medium enterprises (smes) organizations of printing industry. multi-attribute utility theory (maut) are used for the selection of some important criterion in the most trending of maintenance strategy for small and medium enterprises (smes) of printing industry in jabodetabek indonesia. the practical implication shows that for 30 respondents they have a minimum performance indicator allocating a budget for maintenance of 15-25% of net profit. the processing of the survey results shows that from a cost perspective, breakdown maintenance has proven to be more effective than pm. by changing the type of maintenance from pm to bm, small and medium enterprises (smes) printing in jabodetabek can save maintenance costs by 22%.",survey,"Multi-Attribute Utility Theory (MAUT) is used to select several important criteria in the most trending maintenance strategy for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) of the Printing Industry in Jabodetabek Indonesia. The practical implication shows that for 30 respondents they have a minimum performance indicator allocating a budget for maintenance of 15-25% of net profit. This condition is supported by the condition of the machines used by Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) Printing in Jabodetabek. They choose new utilities and rental utilities that have a 1-2 year maintenance guarantee. As for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) Printing in Jabodetabek, 67% choose Breakdown maintenance over Preventive Maintenance, but they keep records of maintenance history well. The processing of the survey results shows that the selection of the type of maintenance has no effect on production activities for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) Printing in Jabodetabek. Meanwhile, from a cost perspective, breakdown maintenance has proven to be more effective than PM. By changing the type of maintenance from PM to BM, Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) Printing in Jabodetabek can save maintenance costs by 22%, the selection of BM is right, supported by the preference results using MAUT that technician / employee training related to printing equipment maintenance, technician availability and recording of maintenance history is not required in terms of maintenance of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) Printing in Jabodetabek. There are 3 things that must be considered in machine maintenance at Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) Printing in Jabodetabek, namely expertise of technicians / employees in performing maintenance, spare parts replacement and maintenance budget so that expertise, spare parts and budget availability are absolute things that must be available to support BM activities.

72,Improving Firm Performance Through  Open Innovation And Change Management,"this study examined the influence of open innovation and change management on the firm performance of national shipping companies. the performance of a business is determined by its operational and financial performance. the functioning of the national shipping sector is under severe strain during this pandemic, owing to the presence of legislation governing the compliance with restrictions on community activities (ppkm). this unstable environment necessitates change management and open innovation to thrive. as such, this research aims to determine the impact of change management and open innovation on the performance of indonesian shipping companies. the analysis was performed in 2020 and covered 126 indonesian shipping companies. the quantitative study employs descriptive and inferential statistical data analysis methods, namely, regression analysis. the findings demonstrate that change management and open innovation have a favorable effect on a company's success. this result indicates that change management and open innovation affect firm performance, meaning that management should devote particular attention to developing open innovation personnel inside the organization. the business may then use a transformation plan to change conditions quickly.","firm performance, change management","The management of the change in the independent variable has a statistically significant impact on the organization's performance. From the regression coefficient, it can be shown that having a positive value for change management may be understood as enhancing the value of corporate performance by boosting company-owned change management. The change management strategy that has been implemented has had a positive impact on the company's performance by increasing employee knowledge, skills, and abilities and providing soft skills training to enhance leadership programs and develop new leaders who can support and improve the company's overall performance. There is a statistically significant relationship between the independent variable of open innovation and the dependent variable of company performance. It is possible to read this as meaning that open innovation may boost the performance of businesses. The determination of an open innovation strategy in a shipping business impacts the stage at which open invention is implemented. As a result, it is possible to quantify the impact of company rules and adjustments created throughout the strategy selection process on the phases of open innovation implementation. This conclusion implies that organizations may execute goal-oriented strategies if they have the appropriate resources. To deploy open innovation in a staged manner, firms in the transportation sector might utilize a mixed approach. As a result, selecting a specific stage for implementing open innovation makes it easier to accomplish the desired results. When open innovation is used at more than one level, it becomes more complicated, requiring more complex tactics and reducing effectiveness. Open innovation is changing or creating more effective processes, products, and ideas. The main reason for companies to innovate is to improve the performance of the company, increasing the capacity of the production process to develop new products and new practices in the organization that can increase the ability of the company to acquire and create new knowledge that can be used to develop other innovations. The results of the study strengthen that change management and open innovation have an impact on company performance, so management can pay special attention to developing the knowledge and innovation of employees in the company","dicky hida syahchari, maria grace herlina management department, binus business school, bina nusantara university, jakarta, indonesia 11480 dicky.syahchari@binus.edu.",

76,Industrial Layouts Design For A Sme In The Electronics  Industry,"with the ever-increasing levels of market competition, companies are continuously forced to innovate and enhance their product development to increase their performance and stay relevant in the market. in this scenario, manufacturing companies must react to this increase in production rhythm by correctly planning and constantly improving the production lines implemented on the shop floor. additionally, to meet the customers’ requirements, it is needed to produce new and quality products at reduced prices. to achieve this, lead times must be reduced, and production lines must become increasingly efficient. the facility layout problem has a significant impact in several important aspects, such as manufacturing costs, work in progress, lead times, and productivity. when adding new production lines, manufacturing companies must do a more in-depth study on how to make this addition without having a negative impact on the efficiency of the already existing production lines and on production costs. in this work, a company that needed to restructure its shop floor to insert a new production line for a new product is portrait. to perceive the impact of this change, three different case studies were analyzed, and layouts were developed for three production lines applying different line balancing techniques and layout development techniques.",,"With the evolution of market demand and technology, the company group focus has been adjusted in order to meet the needs of its target customers. Recently, the group launched onto the market of efficient water management, which resulted in the development of a new product, the MWM. Having this in mind, the efficiency of a production line can be influenced by several parameters, being the layout of the shop floor one of the most important. The company took advantage of the need to add the MWM new production line to the shop floor, to study, not only its layout but also the layouts of other existing production lines whose efficiency has been decreasing. That said, this project was divided into three case studies, each one related to a product family production line: LED Lights Case Study, MWM Case Study and ICP Case Study. Usually, in industry, line balancing and layout problems are often solved and addressed by the production managers, that rearrange the workstations and allocate tasks to operators following a methodology based on practical knowledge. The development of a new production line for a new product is a situation where it makes perfect sense to use the actual existing theoretical methodologies to implement an efficient production line. This last one must be, not only balanced but also, the layout should be optimized to ensure its production efficiency. That said, in the three case studies, design engineering techniques were applied to the layouts development, such as Systematic Layout Planning and Lean Facility Layout System. In addition, linear programming was used to solve the Assembly Line Balancing Problems by applying the most well-known heuristics with the aim to obtain optimized layouts, both in terms of space/resource optimization and in productivity improvement. The first case study depicts the design of the layout of the LED Lights production line. With the layout redesign, considering the movement of workers, there was a significant improvement, reaching 30%. Although there is no significant reduction in lead time, there is a considerable improvement related to product quality, since the movement of non-finished products on the shop floor was considered one of the major causes related to non-conformities. The layout of the new production line is developed in the second case study. Two final layout versions were achieved through two different methodologies (PLB-BM and SLP). The layout from PLB-BM methodology obtained better results both in productivity improvement and in space/resource optimization. In terms of PLB KPIs, the PLB-BM approach has better results than the SPL approach: an improvement of 25,1% in relation to the line efficiency, 39% in relation to the balance delay, and 59,8% in relation to the smoothness index were obtained. The number of workstations reduction shows that the production line with 3 workstations is more efficient, and the balance delay becomes smaller, which can be reflected in a decreasing in the possibility of bottlenecks occurrences. The layout achieved with the PLB-BM is also better in terms of workers moving distances and time, and it outperforms the SLP approach when comparing the production lead time, having a reduction of, approximately, 7,3%. Finally, the third case study portrays the design of the ICP production line layout. In terms of the production line balancing KPIs, the layout achieved the optimal solution of 8 workstations, with an efficiency of 79% and balance delay of a 21%. Since the workstations lower bound is 7, and considering all the existing constraints, it could be stated that the production line has a relatively good efficiency. Regarding the production time KPIs, it was shown that the workers’ movement time represents a small percentage of the production lead time (1,7%), which can be considered an insignificant percentage. Consequently, it can be concluded that the layouts suggested to the company’ Executive Direction are efficient both in terms of resource/space optimization and productivity improvement, due to the production line optimization. 5. Future Work Through the implementation of the proposal layouts the space and the production lines efficiency are optimized. However, if the company culture does not emphasize the cleaning and organization, quickly the little available space ceases to exist, and consequences will be felt, again, in the productive efficiency. That said, it is necessary to review the layouts whenever possible, using different layout design methodologies to eliminate another type of waste inserted in the production line. Since one of the case studies portrays an implementation of a new production line, it is possible that in the beginning of production, the manufacturing processes may suffer some changes, and therefore, there may be variations in the Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management Istanbul, Turkey, March 7-10, 2022 IEOM Society International 681","marlene brás department of economics, management, industrial engineering and tourism university of aveiro aveiro, portugal marlenegomes@ua.pt ana moura department of economics, management, industrial engineering and tourism govcopp – systems for decision support research group university of aveiro aveiro, portugal ana.moura@ua.pt","References

77,Accountability For Operational Costs Using The Business  Process Management At Indonesian Oil And Gas Company,"the accountability system in indonesian oil and gas companies faces several critical problems such as low process efficiency, insufficient transparency, and a high potential for operational cost corruption and fraud. this study aims to analyze a business process of operating accountability cost using a cash card system in a shared service center in one indonesian oil and gas company using business process management. business process management is performed by modeling and simulating the current (as-is) process. modeling as-is process using igrafx with business process modeling and notation (bpmn). process management aims to understand the various activities related to the organization's operations and improve their efficiency. this study aims to identify processes that can be improved to reduce manual processes and time constraints. the proposed solutions are based on best practice methods that can be used to improve business processes. the researcher also suggested reviewing the entire process of making a new cash card so that users do not have to wait long to complete the process.","cash card, operational cost","This study proposes the need to evaluate the submission process and operational cost accountability by recommending several scenarios to reduce User waiting and processing time caused by manual processes. Process improvement can be designed using Business process reengineering using various best-practice methods such as separating large tasks into manageable ones, creating a task list with multiple small ones, and considering parallel tasks. It evaluates cooperation with the Bank issuing cash cards to speed up the manufacturing process to delivery. After assessing the process and SLA with the relevant banks, another suggestion put forward by this research is to enable the User to make cash cards at the nearest bank branch by showing supporting documents that are validated as a valid requirement for making a cash card. It will allow them to complete their work in about an hour to run more optimally the entire cash card process. The researcher suggests reviewing the bank process of making a new cash card. It is recommended that the User come directly to the Bank, as is the case with debit card making in general so that it does not take a long time until the User must wait up to 30 working days. This research is very possible to do a redesign using the concept of reengineering by applying digitization to each process to cut down on a shorter process time such as submitting a new cash card to the bank directly using the relevant user's mobile phone without having to wait for a longer waiting time.","rizki abdillah, m. dachyar, novandra rhezza pratama department of industrial engineering faculty of engineering universitas indonesia depok, indonesia rizki.abdillah@ui.ac.id, mdachyar@yahoo.com, novandra@ui.ac.id",
78,Design Of Organization Strategy And Business Process  Improvement Using Business Model Canvas For Non-Profit,"a non-profit organization with different operating models and economic factors can still adopt the same processes as profit-oriented organizations to improve efficiency and effectiveness. this study will discuss important factors that a non-profit organization needs to consider when implementing the change process. due to reduced funding and increasingly fierce competition from similar organizations, many non-profits have had to face challenges such as improved performance, profitability, and the demands of digitization. this study aims to provide strategic solutions to improve business processes and increase revenue by applying a business model canvas (bmc) concept. the study identified several changes in the appropriate business strategy for a scholarship institution in indonesia following the current business processes of the organization as well as the frameworks in place to strengthen their performance. the main objective of process improvement is to develop organizational commitment and support to facilitate continuous process improvement. bmc is expected to help organizations assess and develop strategies and processes that align with their core values and mission. this strategy's purpose of help organizations addresses social and economic problems by developing practical solutions that meet organizational goals and expectations.",swot,"The results of this study can help non-profit organizations identify areas of improvement that organizational administrators can make to improve organizational performance. Recommended improvement strategies minimize administrative strategic issues that threaten the organization's survival. Doing so can help improve an organization's operations by implementing effective programs and techniques. To enhance its effectiveness, its staff and managers must receive specialized training. Organizations also need to reform their strategies to focus on important issues only and develop unique fundraising plans. The findings of this study help organizations identify their current and potential problems. They can then improve their operations by developing effective strategies and programs to attract more donors. The advantage of canvas business models is that most organizations can use them for different stages of a company's lifecycle. Setting up a business model is not easy; it requires strenuous and collective effort to get it done. Based on the results of case studies conducted against non-profit organizations in Indonesia's business model, it has been concluded that there are nine elements of the business model that need to be improved. Alternative strategies included in the matrix are several formulas that non-profits can use to generate other fundraising techniques for various donors. These include creative fundraising techniques, focused educational issues, self-promotion spaces, capacity building, and network development. The non-profit organization's management team should also discuss these issues with their board members to improve the efficiency of their organizations. The management of a non-profit organization should begin to improve the internal management system that focuses on the most critical issues for the organization. Getting more donations coming in and concentrating on a broader scholarship is two things that need to be focused on by non-profit organizations.","organization in indonesia mutiara, m. dachyar, rahmat nurcahyo department of industrial engineering faculty of engineering universitas indonesia depok, indonesia mutiara.salman@gmail.com , mdachyar@yahoo.com, rahmat@eng.ui.ac.id",
79,Optimization Proposal For Supply Management  Implementing Supply Chain Management And Lean,"nowadays, change is the only constant variable. therefore, business enterprises should focus more attention on them supply chains. the main contribution of this paper is to show the relation between lean warehousing and supply chain management since one is inside the other and they complement each other very well to produce results in the retail sector. in the course of the research, the raised hypothesis was proved since the presented results show a better behavior in a 38.36%, compared to the initial scenario. the results of this research show that retail sector companies must perform appropriate management of their inventories, establish a forecasted demand, and have appropriate warehouse spaces. it was possible to decrease their operations time in a 29.59% and have better management of their resources in a 27.50%. the main objective of this paper is to prove that due to the implementation of engineering techniques in the supply processes that involve warehousing, planning, and inventories, and the subsequent decrease of inefficiency, an alcoholic beverage marketing company optimized its operation in said areas. this research applied a mixed methodology, using direct observation and a discrete event simulation software to optimize complex scenarios (arena).","supply chain, retail sector, such as production","This paper shows that through the implementation of engineering techniques, such as Supply Chain Management and Lean Warehousing tools in the supply chain processes of an alcoholic beverage retail company optimizations can be quantified. Additionally, the studied company’s resources can be better exploited bringing a series of benefits, such as the decrease in costs and expenses, an appropriate type of demand forecasting, and a method to update inventories that adjust to the company’s requirements. This paper is focused on one of the causes of our research problem, which is the delays in picking and packing processes. To tackle this, the Value Stream Mapping lean tool was used to make a deeper diagnosis that allows us to have more details of the process. After that, this data was run through the Arena simulation program and, afterward, the corresponding optimizations using the system layout planning (SLP) lean tool were proposed. As more businesses enter the supply chain of the retail sector market, is more necessary to perform extensive studies about the problems in the supply chain processes and its causes to get solutions through engineering tools. For future research, the reliability rate of the simulation that comprises the optimization techniques could be improved by using other tools that come as a complement of Arena, like Output Analyzer, in which each researcher can determine the reliability percentage that they wish to get on the results. This tool also allows producing statistical analysis based on the simulation results.","warehousing in an alcoholic beverage marketing company of the retail sector claudia-alejandra cavero-quispe, mayra-elizabeth flores-luque and manuel-fernando montoya-ramírez facultad de ingeniería y arquitectura universidad de lima lima, perú 20140281@aloe.ulima.edu.pe, 20160557@aloe.ulima.edu.pe, mmontora@ulima.edu.pe",

81,Robotic Cell Design Through Operation Assignment  Integrated With Sequencing Of Robot Moves,"in this study, we consider the mass production of identical parts consisting of a specific number of operations in a robotic manufacturing cell. the throughput of the cell depends on the robot move sequence, which in turn depends on the assignment of these operations to the machines. despite this relation, the robot move sequencing and line balancing problems discussed in the literature are not integrated, but they are instead solved sequentially. this study is one of the very first to attempt this integration. we formulated the problem as a mixed-integer linear programming formulation. however, in order to be able to solve real-sized problem instances of this np-hard problem, a parametric heuristic algorithm is developed. the performance of the developed solution methods is tested with an extensive computational study. the results indicate that the heuristic algorithm performs efficiently.",line balancing,"In this study, we considered a robotic cell design problem that includes line balancing and robot move sequencing for the first time to the best of the author’s knowledge. We developed a mathematical programming-based exact solution procedure and a heuristic algorithm to solve this NP-hard problem. We calibrated the parameters of the heuristic that uses a sinusoidal function through an initial computational study. Then we tested the performance of the solution procedures through an extensive computational study. The results suggest that, when the number of machines is smaller, the exact procedures can determine the optimal solutions. However, for large values of m, the solution time of MIP increases drastically. The developed ROCLIB heuristic provides high-quality solutions within reasonable CPU times. As a future study, instead of identical parts, mixed or multi-model lines can be considered, where the part sequencing must also be solved. In the current study, the number of machines is assumed to be given, and the objective was to minimize the cycle time (SALBP-2). As a future research direction, the problem can be changed to minimize the number of machines subject to a given cycle time (SALBP-1). Furthermore, in the current study, the robot is assumed to have a single gripper that can hold a single part at any instance. Another future research direction is to consider a dual-gripper robot that can hold two parts simultaneously (see, e.g. Gultekin et al. 2017). The productivity gain that can be attained by using a dual-gripper robot instead of a single-gripper robot can be analyzed so that the additional investment cost of using a dual-gripper robot can be justified. Another future research is to consider assembly line balancing problem together with robot speed optimization as considered in Gürel et al. (2019), and Gultekin et al. (2021).

82,"The Effects Of Autocratic, Democratic, And Laissez-Faire  Leadership Styles On Organizational Performance","nowadays, it is crucial for leaders to implement an optimal leadership style to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of their workforce. through looking at the relationship between leader, follower, and situation, this study aims to investigate the effect of democratic, autocratic, and laissez-faire leadership styles on organizational performance. this study was conducted by observing the secondary data obtained through previous research studies conducted in this field. accordingly, a total of 31 studies was extracted from different research engines. the result of the study shows that there is no one optimal way to lead; each leadership style has its advantages and disadvantages. there was a mixed relationship between the three examined leadership styles. in conclusion, the main implication of this study is that it emphasizes the importance of the leader flexibility to adapt in a changing and uncertain environment.",situation,,"ziad ghazal mba graduate from the lebanese american university adnan kassar school of business lebanese american university beirut, lebanon ziad.ghazal@lau.edu manar hammoud mba graduate from the lebanese american university adnan kassar school of business lebanese american university beirut, lebanon manar.hammoud@lau.edu mohamad ali mezher mba graduate from the lebanese american university adnan kassar school of business lebanese american university beirut, lebanon mohammadali.mezher@lau.edu",
83,A Comparative Study: Application Of Strategic Operations  Management Decisions In Automotive Industry Pioneers,"automotive manufacturing is a highly profitable industry. to ensure production effectiveness and efficiency, the manufacturer must plan ten important operational management decisions. generally, the plan will help to maintain a competitive advantage for respective companies. the sector has become increasingly competitive globally including the united states as new firms enter the market with more vehicle options and specialisation. general motors and ford are the two most successful automakers in the united states. gm has become a significant rival to ford since it overtook ford in 1929. through the years until today, ford is still unable to compete with gm in the usa market. therefore, the paper is an effort to compare the strategies planned by gm and ford in maintaining their competitive advantage in the automotive industry in the us. the study focused on strategic planning through only two critical decisions viz product design and quality management. a qualitative design was used to build a comprehensive theory, then supplemented with literature review findings. in addition, various strategies for achieving the mission were assessed, including research into how well, the already undertaken approaches are performing. this paper examines the new business strategy following more stringent rules and regulations for environmental protection, advanced technology, and customer preferences. these results will assist relevant stakeholders in gaining a deeper understanding of the dynamics in the automotive industry. they will uncover a meaningful difference between the two companies' approaches while attempting to ascertain the precise reasons for gm and ford's rivalry in the us.","product design, quality management","and Recommendations Even though both companies have similar EV-focused plans, GM has made it clear that they are dedicating more to their plans, even though both companies are putting much effort into them. Ford is always just a step behind GM. It is not just about how the portion of their sales goes to electric vehicles, but also how they approach the business differently. Additionally, Ford is trailing GM in its attempts to build a battery in-house. Conversely, Ford is using third parties for its supply chain development to maintain a competitive advantage over GM. As GM is moving much more rapidly in their shift to electric vehicle manufacturing, Ford is moving to an all- truck/SUV portfolio to capitalise on truck market demand. Although Ford is transitioning to a new EV strategy, they have not stopped producing conventional cars entirely. The improvements made to cars in the future should ensure higher standards concerning the environment and safety for the customer, without sacrificing the quality of the cars. There is growing concern over the environment in general and the significant consideration of a 'green car'. Both need to look at the issue as a whole and how this applies to customers. A key component is the plan to lower production costs to stay competitive while also improving the likelihood of retaining customers. In addition to their advertising methods, these two companies differ in the number of brands they have under their control. GM is better situated than Ford because of its diverse range of brands, which allows them to compete better in the American automotive industry. With changes to the market, Ford may get back in the game. However, Ford should take on more risks in the race with GM. Differences in predictions of future growth create a deep divide between the firms. GM also has a competitive advantage in the vast network in their dealership. They also implement quality management in handling their dealership. GM has a high number of dealerships worldwide compared to Ford, which has helped the increase of demand and production. This paper provides insight into the strategic planning of GM and Ford in the automotive industry of the US, which enables them to maintain their competitive advantage. The differing strengths of the firms are in ensuring mission completion. This research is both pertinent and current because it examines the strategy used by Ford to challenge GM, which has seldom been examined academically. This paper offers a comprehensive examination of the new scenario (technological innovation and stricter regulation) and the business strategies designed to engage in it. Additionally, the paper could aid in giving relevant stakeholders a broad, overall perspective to understand how product design and quality management strategy are interlinked. The use of OM strategies has assisted the firms with their overall planning. Despite this, the events of 2020 demonstrated the necessity of modernisation to maintain a viable business. As a result of social distancing practices and widespread lockdowns brought on by the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, there has been an unavoidable increase in the use of digital technologies. Therefore, further research on the agility of each firm in ramping up their technology infrastructure to account for the surge is crucial, given that consumers expect more safety and convenience from automakers. The results may help give a comprehensive overview of the rivalry of these two pioneers in the digitalisation of the automotive industry in the US. In a nutshell, the future of the automobile industry will increasingly be found outside of the vehicle's doors as the needs of automobile consumers change. People will increasingly demand that more of the car-buying process, from research to purchase to delivery, can be done online. A focus on solutions that take advantage of the strengths of both local dealers and the scale of the manufacturers is not just good business but is essential for the company's future.","siti sayidatul durrah khazalle razak faculty of technology and informatics universiti teknologi malaysia kuala lumpur, malaysia durrahkze@gmail.com habibah@norehan haron professor in operation strategy & management razak faculty of technology and informatics universiti teknologi malaysia kuala lumpur, malaysia habibahharon.kl@utm.my abd rahman abdul rahim professor in operation strategy & management razak faculty of technology and informatics universiti teknologi malaysia kuala lumpur, malaysia rahmanar@utm.my",
84,Air Quality In Office Buildings,"this paper will bring the critical debate about the interior office buildings environment and its health implications to a conclusion. the research paper is a descriptive-analytical study that will address both indoor and outdoor air pollutants. the environmental protection agency (epa) recently launched two major investigations into indoor air quality in over 150 public and commercial buildings to learn more. according to epa studies of human exposure to air pollutants, indoor air levels of many toxins are 2–5 times, and occasionally more than 100 times, higher than outside levels. furthermore, both short- and long-term indoor environmental quality is influenced by the materials used in construction and the choices made by architects and designers. as a result, ventilation, construction materials, and furnishings must all be taken into account. the sick building syndrome is a phenomenon or set of situations in which 20% or more of a structure's occupants exhibit symptoms of disease and comfort effects associated with time spent in a building. this paper will simplify and focus the findings of this study to make it easier to use and benefit from and serve as the top of the iceberg of facts and studies that have enabled the researcher to achieve this brevity.","environment, air quality","This study looked into the viability of addressing Sick Building that describes and studies indoor and outdoor air contaminants and analyses of factors and causes affecting the indoor environment in office buildings. As well as the typical changes and problems that occur there; and third, an empirical study of factors and causes affecting the indoor environment in office buildings. The study's findings are provided in a condensed and concentrated style to make them easier to grasp, apply, and serve as the tip of the iceberg of facts and studies that have allowed the researcher to achieve this brevity. Indoor and outdoor studies in office buildings should be stratified to understand better and maximize the casual interactions between ventilation, indoor air humidity, and temperature. In addition, research is needed to find the ideal temperature range in various climate zones. Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) may be released by building materials, office equipment, and most office equipment (VOCs). These toxins can linger for an extended period, emphasizing the urgency of this potentially dangerous issue. As a result, there was a strong link between the concentration of these chemicals and an increased occurrence of Sick Building Syndrome in other investigations (SBS). Workplace discontent and high levels of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs), primarily due to poor workroom ventilation, were significant causes. However, the majority of the microbial pollutants found were from the body's normal flora. Due to a lack of disinfection, sufficient room cleaning, and internal natural ventilation. Appropriate ventilation settings for infection control should be investigated, as should maintaining an optimal temperature and air humidity for human health. The mediating components in work performance research have been temperature, ventilation (CO2), and emission sources. The impact of indoor air humidity on job performance and the possible benefits of alternative ventilation scenarios and odor characteristics should be investigated.

86,Automatic Identification System Data Quality: Outliers  Detection Case,"the automatic identification system (ais) a vessel tracking system. it provides rich information on vessel particulars in addition to dynamic navigational and voyage details. ais data have significantly contributed in the digitization of the shipping industry, but still are prone to measurement and collection errors. as poor data quality leads to inaccurate analysis and affects decision making, a thorough preprocessing of ais data is needed before any use. in this paper, we present the main quality issues encountered when dealing with ais data. this concerns noise, outliers, duplicates, inconsistent data, and out of range values. we also provide some errors examples and how to overcome them. as an application, we address the problem of outliers’ detection in an unsupervised way using clustering and anomaly detection techniques, which attribute an anomaly score for each observation. the case study shows promising results for spatial outliers’ detection, which can be further explored for other anomalies detection tasks.","data quality, outliers detection","AIS data represent an important element in maritime intelligence. To get full insight from the data and use it properly, AIS data should be first prepressed before performing any analysis. Otherwise, AIS data quality and reliability issues may harm the performance of many data mining or Machine Learning techniques. An appropriate use of AIS data suppose that we have learned about their attributes and understood their characteristics. Depending on the problem we want to solve, we should define the needed variables and target the right data sources to avoid wasting time in data sourcing. AIS data veracity is an important challenge as vessels are entirely responsible for the quality of transmitted messages. Any fail in AIS equipment, error in the implementation or manual entry can lead to false and incorrect data. Hence, when analyzed, AIS data should be preprocessed to deal with issues such as noisy, missing, and uncertain information. In this paper we covered the main AIS data issues and provided some examples on how to overcome them. AIS data errors can be induced by technical or human factors and can touch all the attributes. For this reason, a rigorous checking and preprocessing of the data is paramount. However, AIS data volume and velocity can make the preprocessing step very challenging, as they are characterized by high transmission frequency and very large amount of information. Finally, we proposed a case study of spatial outliers’ detection in an unsupervised way. This happens when the position transmitted by AIS does not reflect the exact position of the vessel. In our case, we deal with an extended geographic area and we are interested in detecting false positions with a significant gap from the real ones. Using an AIS dataset of vessels calling a particular port, we applied clustering and anomaly detection techniques to find erroneous vessel positions. The study shows promising results for this outliers’ detection task and could be further investigated for issues related to detecting false, falsified or spoofed AIS information.

87,Imperfect Preventive Maintenance Planning Optimization  For Leased Machines,we aim in this paper to investigate a preventive maintenance scheduling with imperfect repair for a manufacturing system. the considered system is composed of several parallel leased machines. it has to satisfy a random demand over a finite horizon. machines are subject to failures that are strongly correlated to the production rates of each machine. the objective is to study the impact of imperfect preventive maintenance on maintenance plan for a leased system characterized by a variable number of machines. we propose hereinafter a model which allows minimizing the total maintenance cost by obtaining the optimal number of imperfect maintenances for each machine. a numerical example is given in order to validate the robustness of the developed approach.,"leased machines, random demand","We presented in this work an integrated preventive maintenance problem for a parallel leased machines system. We studied the impact of the quantity of goods produced on the degradation rate of the machines as well as the influence of imperfect preventive maintenance activities on the maintenance plan. The number of machines and the quantity produced at each production period which are strongly correlated to the random demand were also determined and used as inputs data to determine the maintenance schedule. In the future, an important extension of this work will be addressed by considering the ecological aspect by the management of the returned products with bad quality. In this context, the returned product can be reused as a raw material in the production process or for remanufacturing, which allows us to optimize consumed energy and reduce the waste that can be created. Another application is possible by extending the proposed model on production system 775","zied hajej, mohamed ali kammoun and nidhal rezg laboratoire de génie informatique, de production et de maintenance (lgipm), metz, france {mohamed-ali.kammoun, zied.hajej, nidhal.rezg}@univ-lorraine.fr","References

89,Proposal For The Implementation Of Methods Engineering  Through The Balancing Of The Assembly Line In The,"over the years, the motion study method has been proved to be a powerful tool for process standardization in the textile industry, which enables determining the standard time for the performance of a specific task. moreover, the processing time plays a pivotal role in the management of the production processes when applying the time study technique. besides, the application of the assembly line balance constitutes a primary goal of manufacturing companies for producing vast quantities in the shortest possible time with satisfactory and efficient results. this research was conducted in a textile company that manufactures denim clothing for women, located in san juan de lurigancho district in lima, peru. it aims to reduce unproductive time in the production line caused by a poor productive process, excessive movements and long waiting times, by means of applying the method engineering and line balance. in order to obtain the required information for this research, arena simulation software has been used for analyzing the cycle time, productivity and efficiency of small and medium enterprises (smes).","motion study, time study, standard time, productivity","The movements of the workers within the process were identified. Then the time and motion study tools also were applied, leading to the control of the travel distance and to the reduction of waiting times that do not add any value.

90,Techno-Economic Evaluation Of Solar Rooftop Photovoltaic  Systems At Factory Building In Indonesia,"indonesia is currently trying to transition from fossil fuel energy to renewable energy. from the six types of renewable energy identified for their potential, solar energy has the highest potential compared to other types of renewable energy, which is 207.8 gwp. one of the ways to utilize this incredible potential of solar energy is by installing solar pv systems on the roof of the building. this study aims to conduct a techno-economic evaluation of a solar pv system installed on the roof of a factory building through a case study of a multinational company in indonesia. the evaluation result shows that the solar pv system has produced 7.4 gwh of electricity from january to december 2021, and the performance ratio is between 63.8% and 84.58%. the electricity produced is used as a backup power supply from the state electricity company in indonesia. the economic evaluation shows that the solar pv systems have a positive net present value with 10.8 years of investment return. co2 saved emission by using this clean energy is calculated at 168,253 ton co2 equivalent for 25 years of solar pv system lifetime.","renewable energy, solar pv system","Based on the techno-economic evaluation conducted on solar rooftop photovoltaic systems at one of the multinational companies in Indonesia, it can be concluded that this solar PV system is feasible. The solar rooftop photovoltaic system has a good performance ratio which is ranged between 63.84% to 94.58%, with an annual average performance ratio of 73.02%. However, the annual energy yield of these solar PV systems has a little bit lower than the average Indonesian territory, which is 1,158 kWh/kWp. The economic analysis result shows that the solar PV system has a good financial parameter shown by positive NPV value, IRR value is 8.46% higher than the discounted rate used as an assumption, 10.8 years of payback period, and the benefit-cost ratio is more than 1. Meanwhile, the LCOE of the solar PV system is 1,914.36 IDR/kWh or 0.13 USD/kWh. It is still higher compared to the industrial electricity tariff from PLN. Total CO2 saved emission by using clean energy from the solar rooftop photovoltaic system is estimated at 168,253 ton CO2 eq for 25 years of solar PV systems lifetime. This number of CO2-saved emissions contributes to the Indonesian government's target of the energy transition and also to the commitment of PT. XYZ of using clean energy in their operational activities.","fery permadi h, m. dachyar, farizal department of industrial engineering faculty of engineering universitas indonesia depok, indonesia fery.permadi@ui.ac.id, mdachyar@yahoo.com, farizal@eng.ui.ac.id",

The first experimental setup studied the effect of UV-C on PAW generation and the irradiation time. The result shows that PAW with UV-C irradiation at 20 min exposure time can induce the highest H2O2, 2.92 ppm. Then, similarly to alcohol gel for disinfection, plasma gel was prepared using 75% concentration. Then, the efficacy test of plasma gel in 3 issues was performed: the persistence test of H2O2 concentration in 7 days, the effective reduction of E. coli test, and the sensory satisfaction test. According to the results of the persistence test, after 7 days, the H2O2 concentration in the plasma gel decreased from 2.19 to 0.28 ppm. Next, the spread plate method investigated the efficacy test for reducing E. coli (TISTR 117). The ability of the control gel and the plasma gel to reduce E. coli was compared in this experiment. According to the findings, plasma gel products can reduce bacterial infection by more than 1.21 log CFU/ml, making them suitable for disinfection. The final test is the sensory comparison between plasma gel and alcohol gel with 6 characteristics: texture, smell, dryness, stickiness, moisture, and evaporation drying time. According to 30 participants, consumers prefer plasma gel to alcohol gel in terms of smell, stickiness, and evaporation drying time. Further study to optimize PAW condition and effective virus evaluation are among project milestones to develop an alternative disinfection substance for the consumer.","soithong lungparn advanced manufacturing and management technology research center department of industrial engineering, chiang mai university chiang mai, thailand soithong_lu@cmu.ac.th wassanai wattanutchariya advanced manufacturing and management technology research center department of industrial engineering, chiang mai university chiang mai, thailand wassanai@eng.cmu.ac.th",

96,Game Over: An Application Of Customer Churn Prediction  Using Survival Analysis Modelling In Automobile Insurance,"customer churn poses a big challenge in financial institutions including the field of insurance. hence, retention analyses are designed to predict time to churn and identify which among the customers are most likely to leave the company so that retention campaigns and strategies may be done to address the issue. by using 6-year data of individual insurance policyholders from an automobile insurance company in asia, the study utilized kaplan-meier, log-rank tests and cox-proportional hazard model to understand the risk of churning and to identify significant factors affecting the said event of interest. demographic variables, including age, marital status, region, as well as policy and claim details, including mortgagee and claim indicator, were found to be significant in the hazard model. furthermore, results of k-prototypes, a clustering algorithm used for handling mixed data types, show that customers can be grouped into three (3) clusters and that strategies must be geared towards retaining the young, single and working adults’ segment.","customer churn, survival analysis","and Recommendation Customer churn poses a big challenge in various industries including motor insurance (Gunter et al. 2014). Aside from the entry of digital innovations and threat of direct competitors, retaining customers within insurance companies is more challenging as policies are renewed every year (Azzopardi and Spiteri, 2018). Hence, customer retention analyses are being done to predict customers with higher chances of leaving the company and to facilitate market segmentation for development of campaigns and strategies (Zaqueu 2019). By using 6-year data of motor insurance individual policyholders from an insurance company in Asia, the study utilized Cox’s Proportional hazard model to analyze and to identify significant factors in understanding the risk of churning. To address violation of the proportionality assumption for specific covariates, interactions with time were included in the model. From the data, it was noted that almost half of the total customers have already left the company after insuring their vehicles for one year. Demographic variables age and single status were also found to be directly proportional to the individual’s risk of churning. Other variables and policy details such as mortgaged indicator, claim code indicator, coverage type, and policy type also differently yet significantly affect the chance of churn. Furthermore, results of K-Prototypes, a combination of K-modes and K-means, show that individual customers of the company can be grouped into three clusters depending on age and churning characteristic. The largest and most significant cluster was identified to consist of young to working single adults who own preferred units yet whose churn rate is very high and survival time is momentary. These results may be used by insurance providers in fine-tuning marketing approaches for customer relationship management and leverage on this knowledge for retention and acquisition campaigns (Zaqueu 2019). For further studies, it is suggested to include more demographic variables in the study such as occupation, income, educational attainment for better profiling and analysis of customers. Furthermore, underwriting guidelines, profitability analysis and segmentation of insured risks of companies may also be considered. Future researchers may also opt to compare the survival analysis model to other machine learning techniques to predict time of churn. Insurance providers may also follow the methodology of this research to evaluate effectiveness of retention strategies developed and implemented, as if inclusion of observations in a specific campaign as a ‘treatment’ or covariate in the survival analysis model.

99,"Pricing And Inventory Planning For Perishable Products  With Price, Stock, And Promotional Effort Sensitive Demand","this study models the problem of a retailer in making a joint pricing and inventory decision of a perishable product considering the price, stock, and promotional effort sensitive demand. the main objective is to determine the optimal price, replenishment schedule, and promotional effort cost to maximize total profit in a finite planning horizon. we show that the total profit generated during the planning horizon is a concave function of the price and the cost of promotional effort. it has been proven through an analytical approach that the optimal solution exists and is unique. we also develop an efficient algorithmic procedure to determine the optimal solutions of the proposed model. numerical examples are provided to illustrate the proposed model's applicability. the optimal solution's sensitivity to key parameters has been investigated, and the results are discussed.","inventory, pricing, promotional effort","This paper investigated the inventory model for a joint pricing, inventory, and promotional effort decision planning of a perishable product under a finite horizon setting. The demand is characterized as dependent on price and available stock in the retailer, which is further influenced by promotional effort. Furthermore, numerical examples, sensitivity analysis, and managerial implications are provided by varying the values of critical parameters to illustrate the model. Besides identifying the importance of pricing and inventory level, the numerical results also demonstrated the importance of promotional effort in operational decision-making at the retailer. The solution shows that investing in an optimal promotional effort cost can increase overall profit. It explains that in order to generate maximum profit, the retailer should promote the perishable product in a certain way so that the items can be efficiently promoted and sold during the selling period before being deteriorated. For future works, it is possible to extend this model to include a multi-item EOQ model, a trade credit policy, and the expansion of the entities involved in the distribution channel. Moreover, it would be interesting to investigate the model in the context of a supply chain.","winda narulideaa,b, ahmad rusdiansyaha, sri gunani partiwia adepartment of industrial and systems engineering institut teknologi sepuluh nopember surabaya, indonesia bdepartment of logistics engineering universitas internasional semen indonesia gresik, indonesia winda.narulidea@uisi.ac.id",
100,Demand And Supply Planning For Covid-19 Vaccine In  Turkey With An Anti-Vaccine Survey,"the covid-19 virus, which affects many people, continues in a very contagious state. vaccination is necessary to end this pandemic period, which everyone wants to end as soon as possible. the studies in the literature focuses on different phases of the vaccination such as product, production, allocation or distribution. existing, expected and sudden outbreaks are studied considering developed and developing countries. but many studies in the or/om community focus on expected outbreaks in developed countries. there are however a limited number of studies for sudden outbreaks because of the uncertainties. therefore, in this study, we focus on covid-19 which is a sudden outbreak and the study is executed in a developing country, turkey. as the attitude towards vaccination might differ across subpopulations, vaccine hesitancy might affect all of purchasing, distribution, and allocation decisions of vaccines. we conduct a survey in order to reduce the uncertainties about the vaccine demand. we analyze on vaccine selections, government decisions about the purchase of the vaccines, vaccination groups and create a supply chain plan considering that the vaccines are available in batches over time. covid-19 affects us in a very harmful way and there are several issues we can consider in order to come up with an efficient vaccination plan. since the vaccine demand is the key factor that effects our decisions, we have to forecast the demand with the least error we can get. if the predicted demand is higher, we would purchase vaccines more than we need and we have to deal with wastage and purchasing costs. if the predicted demand is less than the actual demand, we would miss the opportunity to vaccinate more people and to get closer to the end of the pandemic. so, by predicting the demand in an accurate way, we can make more meaningful decisions in our supply chain. in our survey, we predict the behavior of individuals in turkey by asking questions about side effects of vaccines, the acceptance of vaccine brands, the distrust of the government and the number of cases announced, etc. the responses help us plan the supply chain weekly, considering most of the thoughts of the community. after forecasting the weekly demand for each vaccine brands, we use them in our optimization model to construct a weekly vaccine supply plan for each vaccine brand for turkey over a one-year planning horizon. the goal of the optimization model is to minimize the total costs of purchasing, transportation, storage, and backordering costs. in this model, we consider storage and transportation capacity limits, minimum required vaccination rate to reach the herd immunity, and vaccine demand satisfaction with respect to priorities of different risk groups.","demand forecasting, optimization, covid-19 vaccine",,"i̇rina pınar tuğrul graduate student in industrial engineering faculty of engineering özyeğin university istanbul, turkey irina.vinache@ozu.edu.tr zehra melis teksan assistant professor in industrial engineering faculty of engineering özyeğin university istanbul, turkey melis.teksan@ozyegin.edu.tr",
101,Supply Chain Improvement Strategy With Extended  Warranty On Retailers,"this study demonstrates that an extended warranty is a signal of product quality and an improvement strategy in the supply chain. as one of the after-sales services, it assures customers and significantly contributes to the profits of manufacturers and retailers with a more extended warranty period than the base warranty. however, the extended warranty period imposes additional costs for the manufacturer and the retailer that might influence their profits. we address this concern by considering a manufacturer that offers base warranties to two retailers in the identical market segment. we propose two different strategies in this study. the first strategy is that retailers do not apply an extended warranty, while the second applies the contrary. assuming that customers are risk-prone to an extended warranty, the results explain that the extended warranty strategy provides the supply chain with a higher profit than a strategy without an extended warranty. a manufacturer and retailers also benefit significantly from implementing an extended warranty strategy. furthermore, numerical illustration and sensitivity analysis is performed for model verification and better understanding.","extended warranty, retailer, supply chain, warranty model","We built a two-level supply chain warranty model, a manufacturer, and two retailers in the same market segment in this paper. The mathematical model was developed to maximize the overall supply chain profit by considering several parameters, i.e., demand, warranty costs, and the expected number of claims. According to the analysis, Strategy II, where the retailer delivers the extended warranty, results in more enormous profits of the entire supply chain than Strategy I, without providing the extended warranty. Moreover, the results show that the retailer offering the longer extended warranty earns more profits than the retailer proposing the shorter extended warranty. The manufacturer also gets higher profits when retailers offer extended warranties. It is because customer demand increases with the length of the warranty offered. This study highlights the importance of warranty extension as one of the strategies in after-sales service. While an extended warranty can signal quality, this study confirms that an extended warranty strategy can increase profitability at all levels in the supply chain. By linking theory and practice, we offer these strategies to decision- makers across the supply chain to increase their business efficiency and profitability. However, we realize that our research is still limited and can develop in the future. Therefore, we propose several directions for future investigations, such as developing a stochastic demand model, adding other parameters, and adding levels or parties involved in the supply chain. In addition, we also suggest exploring the warranty strategy from the customer's viewpoint as a decision-maker.

104,Prioritization Of Circular Economy Barriers Using Best  Worst Method,"circular economy aims to maintain the product value as long as possible. researches indicate that ce implementation is difficult due to different challenges. in this study, we prioritize ce implementation barriers in order to identify which barriers to deal with first. to achieve this objective, barriers weights are calculated through the best worst method. a systematic literature review is conducted to identify ce challenges. then, experts from different industrial sectors were called to prioritize these barriers based on their experience. the best worst method excel solver was used to calculate local and global weight of each challenge. the findings of this study suggest that economic issues are the most significant barriers to ce implementation followed by supply chain management issues, technological, cultural and finally governmental issues. this study aims to help decisions makers from different sectors to prepare their transition to circular flow by defeating main barriers. however, due to the limited considered number of barriers and experts, future research can be extended to more barriers and more experts.","circular economy, barriers, bwm, producing","The objective of this research is to prioritize challenges to circular economy implementation. Since challenges cannot be defeated once, a hierarchical vision of these challenges allows companies to go step by step in this sustainable project. We used the best-worst method based on the opinion of experts to prioritize barriers. Based on our results, the major barriers are related to financial challenges and supply chain management. Weak economic incentives, investment cost and lack of collaboration through the supply chain are the most relevant barriers that must be defeated. First, companies have to maintain enough funds before implementing CE. Government and other organizations must support companies to shift toward circular flow. Second, Supply chain partners must develop a good collaboration based on the same objectives to ensure extracting value from material several times. Third, companies need to have access to accurate data and advanced technologies at a reasonable cost. Also, the training centers must focus on developing employ’s skills. Customer and society must be aware of environmental threats and encourage producers to provide more eco-friendly products. This study has some limitations. Barriers are extracted from literature and the number of experts is only 8. For future research, authors can investigate more barriers by interviewing industrial actors. Also, the number of experts can be extended.","khadija echefaj and abdelkabir charkaoui faculty of sciences and techniques hassan first university of settat settat, morocco k.echefaj@uhp.ac.ma, abdelkabir.charkaoui@uhp.ac.ma anass cherrafi ensam- meknes moulay ismail university meknes, morocco a.cherrafi@ensam.umi.ac.ma",

106,"Optimization Of Supply Chain Strategies To Meet Delivery  Goals With Anp, Swot, And Topsis Approaches: A Case","the sugar refinery industry in indonesia is one of the important sectors of the manufacturing industry. the sugar refinery industry should supply the product to the other industries as the raw material to produce the solid product. according to the industry supply, the sugar refinery industry needs to optimize the strategy to deliver the product to meet customer demand. this research aims to optimize the supply chain management strategy in the sugar refinery industry to meet the delivery targets by using 3pl. the 3pl's transportation network comprises many lanes, each of which connects to a city in another state or province. with hundreds of shipping orders arriving every day, the 3pl can maintain the delivery focus on transportation availability and process to deliver the product as per request from the customer. this study was conducted based on analysis that included surveys and secondary data, which included the plan vs. actual delivery to see the differentiation before and after using the 3pl on the process to improve the delivery goals in the sugar refinery industry. furthermore, this study uses a combination of an anp, swot analysis, and the topsis method to implement the supply chain strategy in the supply chain department and conducts an evaluation review to identify the best strategy to implement the fulfillment delivery for the sugar refinery industry to optimize and achieve the delivery targets for sugar refinery products in the sugar refinery industry.","3pl, delivery, anp","This paper is the first to implement an ANP, SWOT, and TOPSIS hybrid model to identify and evaluate the criteria for an RL outsourcing decision. The social commerce platform as an important support system for reverse logistics should be a strategic goal for businesses. To adapt to the reverse logistics market environment, it is imperative to conduct research on the social commerce network and highly integrated social commerce platforms. It may not be suitable to produce and solve a single model that represents the wider issues at the milling–marketing interface. This is due to increased complexity from incorporating more issues (not all of them fully tangible) within the supply chain while trying to maintain practical relevance for industry decision-makers. Multi-agent modeling is one methodology being considered for capturing the broader supply chain issues while maintaining acceptance and ownership by the decision-maker. The decision to choose a single transporter to use for logistic management is quite successful because it enables the management to maintain the communication and coordination between companies and transporters more intensely by evaluating issues and taking corrective action while the daily delivery is still ongoing.","study of the sugar refinery industry ayu mandasari nasution, m. dachyar and novandra rhezza pratama industrial engineering department universitas indonesia depok, indonesia ayu.mandasari@ui.ac.id, mdachyar@yahoo.com, novandra@office.ui.ac.id",

Between service quality and customer perceived value to each other and in the same direction to increase customer loyalty. The marketing strategy for these two variables is the key to Uniqlo's success in the fashion business. Policies that support the improvement of service quality and customer perceived value for each other for consumers are absolute. This is important because this policy strategy has a dual effect not only to increase customer loyalty but also to increase sales of Uniqlo products. Efforts to improve service quality can be done through improvement of facilities and infrastructure including buildings, equipment, nice places, and services including the friendliness of shop assistants. Efforts to increase loyalty for consumers are needed.

Hypothesis 1 says that brand image has a significant positive impact on brand trust in Prudential Indonesia customers. The analysis results showed the critical ratio with a value of 2.644 and a significance of P of 0.008. It shows that the higher the value of the brand image will affect the brand trust of 2.644. So if the brand image variable increases by 1 unit, it will increase the brand trust variable by 2.644. 2. Hypothesis 2 says that price significantly impacts brand trust in Prudential Indonesia customers. The analysis results showed the critical ratio with a value of 4.888. It shows that the higher the price value, it will affect the brand trust of 4.888. So if the variable price increases by 1 unit, it will increase the brand trust variable by 4.888. 3. Hypothesis 3 says that customer-oriented services positively but significantly impact brand trust in Prudential Indonesia customers. The analysis results show that the critical ratio with a value of 0.556 indicates that the higher the value of customer-oriented services, it will affect the brand trust of 0.556, but it is not significant. So if the variable price increases by 1 unit, it will only increase the brand trust by 0.556. 4. Hypothesis 4 says that brand image significantly impacts customer buying decisions for Prudential Indonesia customers. The analysis results show that the critical ratio with a value of 7.333 shows that the higher the value of the brand image will affect the customer buying decision by 7.333. So if the brand image variable increases by 1 unit, it will increase the omer buying decision by 7,333. 5. Hypothesis 4 says that brand trust has a positive but insignificant impact on customer buying decisions for Prudential Indonesia customers. The analysis results show that the critical ratio with a value of 1.658 shows that the higher the value of brand trust, it will affect the customer buying decision by 1.658. So if the variable price increases by 1 unit, it will only increase the brand trust by 0.556. However, the changes will not be significant. 6.1. Limited and Sugestion In this study, there are several limitations, some of which are: 1. This study only covers customers who have an active prudential insurance policy in Indonesia. 2. This research is limited to the variables of brand image, brand trust, customer-oriented services, and price influence customer buying decisions. Based on the limitations of this study, suggestions for future research can be taken: 1. Research can be extended not only to prudential insurance companies but also to other well-known insurance companies in Indonesia 2. In further research suggests adding a mediating variable or other independent variables such as customer perceived value, brand experience, and other variables that can better see the effect on brand trust and customer buying decisions.","mediation variables in prudential insurance co. a. soegihono and john tampil purba department of management faculty of economics and business universitas pelita harapan, tangerang-15811, indonesia corresponding author: john.purba@uph.edu sidik budiono department of management faculty of economics and business universitas pelita harapan, tangerang-15811, indonesia sidik.budiono@uph.edu",

114,Strategy Formulation Of Health Clinic Service Improvement  In Covid-19 Condition Using Fuzzy Ahp And Qfd Method,"clinics are one of the sectors affected by the covid-19 pandemic. clinics are one of the sectors affected by the covid-19 pandemic. from the clinic that became the object of research, the number of customers in several polyclinics such as the dental poly and maternal and child health poly fell by 50%. this is because the change in customer habits to visit clinics and clinics is one of the places to be avoided during the pandemic. the role of clinics as the front line in handling covid-19 and people's fear of visiting clinics are things that must be balanced to improve the quality of health clinic services. this study uses makara ui clinic in indonesia, depok which provides services for general poly, dental poly, maternal and child health poly, counseling poly, pharmacy, laboratory and covid-19 services such as vaccination and swab antigen/pcr tests. this study uses the integration of analytical hierarchy process (ahp) and quality function deployment (qfd) methods to evaluate and improve services at a health clinic. ahp is used to obtain consumer preferences for clinical services mathematically. qfd is used to determine corrective actions and service targets according to patient needs. from the literature study and expert validation, there were 5 primary factors and 14 secondary factors that became customer needs. these factors and subfactors were assessed by weighting using pairwise comparison. based on these factors and ratings, this is the target for evaluating and improving services.","health care service, clinic service",,"jihan rihadatul aisy siregar and m. dachyar industrial engineering department universitas indonesia depok, indonesia jihannzri@gmail.com, mdachyar@yahoo.com",
115,Unpacked Selling: A Zero-Waste Alternative To Single-Use  Packaging But Is It Profitable?,"more than 28% of municipal waste comes from packaging (epa, 2020), generating one of the main sources of solid waste. although recycling may be a remedy to a certain extent, the difficulties in and high costs of collection, separation, and recycling, challenge its feasibility (bafu, 2019). hence, to prevent the problem at the source, companies search for ways to reduce or eliminate their product packaging, e.g., through unpacked (bulk) selling. while unpacked selling already exists in local markets, large producers' adoption is still new. one recent and innovative implementation is nestle's dispensers for cat food and coffee (nestle, 2020). but, how would unpacked selling affect these large producers' traditional sales and market share, and what are the conditions under which unpacked selling would be profitable? in this study, we aim to answer these questions using a stylized model in a duopoly environment with low- and high-end producers. the producers choose whether to offer single-use package products and/or unpacked products and corresponding prices. consumers make their purchasing decisions maximizing their utility. they factor in the utility from product and packaging separately in their valuations. our results reveal when it is profitable for each producer to introduce unpacked products.","unpacked selling, price competition",,"öznur özdemir-akyıldırım associate professor of operations management faculty of economics and administrative sciences akdeniz university antalya, turkey oozdemirak@akdeniz.edu.tr gökçe esenduran assistant professor of operations management department of management purdue university west lafayette, in 47907-2056 usa gesendur@purdue.edu",
116,The Use Of Gravitational Law To Assess Urban Balance: The  Case Of Makkah Region   In Saudi Arabia,"gravitational studies have been a key instrument in analyzing spatial flows. in this research, we will be highlighting the relevance of the data related to population and distances between urban centres in assessing the urban balance of human settlements using a gravitational law. our hypothesis stipulates that an urban centre's real urban population is different from the one included in its theoretical geographic boundaries. the assessment process is based on the functional weight of various urban centres. we will implicate the urban infrastructure then each centre's functional ""areas of influence"" in the entire region. we aim to test the validity of the mathematical reilly law on our study corpus, which is makkah province, using the mentioned parameters. in addition, there was an attempt to model the real urban attraction of cities. finally, the calculation results of the urban centres attractions are pulled down to be projected on the geographic map of our case study. the study findings reveal a discordance between the real weights and sizes of the urban centres and the theoretical ones, which discloses a clear unbalance of the urban system that needs to be addressed.","urban balance, the holy makkah, reilly gravity law","(12 font) By adopting a gravity model more general than the Newtonian one used by Reilly, we were able to reveal a significant disparity between the actual urban boundaries and the theoretical ones modelled and projected on the map of our case study. Empirical studies seem to confirm the existence of a very marked functional polarization in the urban system of the Makkah region. There is a significant difference within the administrated functional areas; the large centres such as Jeddah, Makkah and Al-Taef serve the centres located in their urban administrative territories and a large part of the rural populations of the lower levels. Their functional influence is much more significant than the actual projection of their regions. The geographic proximity of these large centres contributes to the over-concentration of the population and the over-exploitation of services, which are not provided for the centres with lower number of occupants. We don't claim to have an inclusive, comprehensive diagnosis of the urban balance complexity in Makkah Region. Yet, we believe that this research is a milestone in the broader investigation that will include other parameters. This urban imbalance needs to be first scrutinized and approved using more assessing parameters and then addressed in terms of goods and equipment, which could be the subjects of further promising research investigations.","dr amani derbali, dr salma dwidar, dr amal abdelsattar, dr hala sirror. assistant professors college of architecture& design prince sultan university, riyad, ksa aderbali@psu.edu.sa, swidar@psu.edu.sa, aabdelsattar@psu.edu.sa, hsirror@psu.edu.sa, prof abdallah farhi full professor, dean architecture department university of mohamed khedhir biskra algeria farhikam@gmail.com donia abdelgawad assistant professor of architecture department faculty of fine art alexandria university donia_abdelgawad@alexu.edu.eg",
117,Internet Of Things Technology Selection For Monitoring  Process At Palm Oil Mills,"the palm oil industry is one of indonesia's most important industries, contributing a significant portion of the country's non-oil and gas exports, which is growing every year. palm oil's selling price is impacted by its quality, which is maintained by continuous monitoring of the production process in order to ensure that the oil fulfills the required quality requirements. until now, the palm oil companies are still experiencing difficulties in monitoring the quality of palm oil in the storage process. the goal of this research is to find the best possible internet of things (iot) technology that could be employed inside the palm oil mill monitoring process while considering the internet of things' criteria. iot to monitoring processes could help the company monitor palm oil condition with less oversight, increase leads to an overall with actual proof of outcomes, and promptly includes recommendations discrepancies. to weight the factors for deploying monitoring technology, the best worst method (bwm) was employed. any proposed monitoring technology in palm oil mills has been rated using the complex proportional assessment method (copras). the final result is that scada is chosen based on the criterion of internet of things implementation.","palm oil mill, monitoring","This study shows that the objective of using a combination of BWM and COPRAS methodologies to determine the optimal IoT technology application was achieved. This research resulted in the selection of 28 sub-criteria from four existing criteria. The Ease of Use sub criteria has the highest weight in the BWM computation findings, indicating that this factor plays a huge role in adopting the IoT. According to COPRAS, SCADA technology should be prioritized when considering IoT technology deployment for storage tank monitoring process measures at palm oil mills because it has a 100% utility rate. Based on the fact that these technologies have high priorities in the majority of cases, the final results suggest that SCADA is the top priority for technologies that can be implemented.","namira hasna latifah and m. dachyar industrial engineering department universitas indonesia depok, indonesia namirahasna@gmail.com, mdachyar@yahoo.com",
118,Packaged Juice Warehouse Operations Improvement Using  Business Process Reengineering Approach,"indonesia's packaged juice sector has a large market and contributes to the country's gdp. it is necessary to have a supply chain that responds to high customer demand to meet these needs. the warehouse acts as a storage and a source of information on the availability of goods to meet consumer demand, giving a significant impact on overall business process operations. there are still challenges in the warehouse that might lower warehouse operations' efficiency and make them less responsive to customer needs. this study aims to design improvements of the warehousing operations in the packaged juice industry through a business process reengineering (bpr) approach by utilizing the internet of things (iot) technology to improve time efficiency. this research presents 4 process improvement scenarios for packaged juice warehouses, with varied handling processing times for each scenario. scenario 4 which uses automated inventory system using rfid, handheld mobile computers, and automated picking direction using voice which have the highest time efficiency, namely for raw material warehouses, inbound (8%), outbound (25%), and stocktake (35%) and finished goods warehouse, for inbound (3%), outbound (45%), and stocktake (25%).","packaged juice, warehouse","This research proposes using the BPR approach in conjunction with the internet of things to improve the packaged juice warehouse process. There are four scenarios for improving the packaged juice warehouse's operational process, including integrating technology and business process elimination..

Six sub-factors of strength, seven sub-factors of weakness, four sub- factors of opportunity, and three sub-factors of threats affecting the company's business performance and is used in the selection of business improvement strategies were obtained based on expert opinion. In line with the results of the weighting of the company's SWOT factors and subfactors, it is known that the weakness factor and broad market potential (O1) are the factors and subfactors that have the highest importance that must be considered by decision makers in formulating and choosing the right strategy for business improvement. Establishing a community of practice (CoP) to increase brand awareness (WO4), expanding the marketing network by implementing a joint marketing strategy (SO1), and offering a new business scheme approach through revenue sharing (SO3) is the selected business improvement approach with the greatest TOPSIS performance score. and level of effort assessment. Additionally, in conformity with the analysis of the effort assessment results, these three strategies will have a significant impact on the company's benefits, albeit with varying periods of benefit receipt. This study is restricted to SWOT analysis development, which only involves internal and external parties (industrial practitioners). Existing and potential customers are expected to be involved in further research to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the company's SWOT results. External parties are only considered when weighting factors and sub-factors from a SWOT analysis, and interactions and dependencies between listed factors and sub-factors are not taken into account. Further study should be capable of developing SWOT-MCDM integration utilizing a method that considers the interaction of these factors, notably the Analytic Network Process (ANP). Future research is also expected to explore recommendations for implementing other business improvement strategies (which are not prioritized in this study) and their impact on improving the business of ERP provider companies.","method kania raihan nabila and m. dachyar department of industrial engineering university of indonesia depok 16424, indonesia kania99@gmail.com, mdachyar@yahoo.com",

122,Enhancing Efficiency Of Plasma-Activated Water   Using Microbubbles/Nanobubbles Techniques,"this research investigated the treatment of plasma-activated water (paw) and microbubbles/nanobubbles (mnb) to increase the disinfection efficiency. the sequence of paw and mnb preparation, as well as the type of water, were studied, investigated four operating conditions by comparing the sequence of mnb (before paw or concurrent with paw) at two types of water (ro or tap water). plasma activated water characterized the effectiveness of paw/mnb in terms of chemical properties, consisting of ec ph orp and h2o2 concentration. the measurements of ec showed that the treatment with mnb before paw on tap water produced the highest amount of ec, which is 222.33 µs/cm. the ph measurements showed the acidic ph in mnb incorporating paw studies ranged from 3.24 to 4.32. in the meantime, the treatment mnb before paw on tap water also led to the highest amount of orp, which is 492.70 mv. finally, the h2o2 measurement showed that treated water with mnb before paw could induce the highest h2o2 concentration, 6.13 mg/l. this study concludes that the sequence of mnb and paw treatment and the water type have influenced ec in tap and ro water, orp in ro water, and h2o2 content in tap and ro water. further study based on this result will further investigate foodborne pathogens in the poultry industry.","plasma technology, hydrogen peroxide","This research investigated the enhancement of PAW by combining with MNB to increase the efficiency of disinfection using EC pH ORP and H2O2 measurements as chemical properties evaluation. The factors under investigation include the sequence of MNB and PAW and the type of water. The sequence experiment significantly affects EC, ORP, and H2O2 concentration, but not pH. Therefore, MNB should be used initially before PAW. Furthermore, the water type also significantly affects EC ORP and H2O2 concentration. In this study, tap water usually has a higher content of minerals than RO water, showing a more significant value of chemical properties after being treated with MNB and PAW. Therefore, tap water in the MNB/PAW experiment could have higher efficacy than RO water. Since the main effect of disinfection came from ROS, H2O2 concentration is the key to representing the efficacy of this combination technique. Consequently, the appropriate conditions for this study would be the treatment of tap water with MNB first and followed by PAW could lead to the highest amount of H2O2 concentration, ORP, and EC, which are 6.13 mg/L 492.7, and 222.33 µS/cm, respectively. Further research is needed to determine the impact of PAW combined with MNB technology on foodborne pathogens, and the optimal conditions for pathogen inactivate in the poultry industry.","kochakon moonsub* ph.d.'s degree program in industrial engineering, advanced manufacturing and management technology research center department of industrial engineering, chiang mai university chiang mai, thailand kochakon_moo@cmu.ac.th dheerawan boonyawan plasma and beam physics research facility department of physics and materials science, faculty of science, chiang mai university, chiang mai, thailand vishnu tonglek department of electrical engineering, faculty of engineering, rajamangala university of technology lanna, chiang mai, thailand wassanai wattanutchariya* advanced manufacturing and management technology research center department of industrial engineering, chiang mai university chiang mai, thailand wassanai@eng.cmu.ac.th",

124,An Integrated Intuitionistic Fuzzy Mcdm Approach To  Rank Alternatives Of Polycarbonate Thermoplastic Resins,"polycarbonate (pc) resins are widely preferred by manufacturers to produce a large portfolio of products. it is in the group of thermoplastic polymers. pcs are durable, flame-retardant, and have efficient electricity insulation performance. they can be used to produce many different types of products like capacitors, dome lights, roofing sheets, compact disks, water bottles, decorative bezels, etc. it is a crucial issue to select rational pc resin specific to the application area. the manufacturers can optimize their processes, as well as finances by selecting the most appropriate resin. many methods may be applied to optimize the selection process. in this paper, a multi-criteria decision-making (mcdm) model is proposed that considers both technical criteria and operational criteria. the intuitionistic fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (if-ahp) method is integrated into the intuitionistic fuzzy goal programming (if-gp) method to weight criteria, assess the alternatives, and suggest ranking of the alternatives. a sensitivity analysis completes the methodology to determine the boundaries of the solution. the results reveal that they are very sensitive to weighting preferences since pc resin alternatives show very similar properties considering defined criteria.",goal programming,"and Future Research By replacing alternative materials in production lines, the use and consumption of engineering plastics constantly increase. The market in 2020 was valued at USD 90 billion and projected to get bigger (Mordorintelligence, 2021). Being part of this market, PC is highly preferred to produce a variety of components. It is very important to select the most appropriate alternative resin to minimize operational and quality costs, and optimize process. In this study, we propose an MCDM methodology to rank alternatives of PC resins for the injection molding process. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study that integrates IF-AHP into IF-GP and analysis the results with sensitivity analysis. The methodology can reflect the concrete or uncertain preferences of DMs even the alternative may be evaluated with linguistic terms instead of crisp values. The results reveal that any subjective evaluation for weighting may easily influence the results of the ranking. This outcome consolidates the importance of sensitivity analysis. Another originality is in the case study. The dataset for the case study covers both operational and technical criteria of PC resins that are mostly handled separately in studies. As a future study, different types of MCDM algorithms may be integrated into IF-AHP to determine and compare IF- GP performance. Another point is the hesitancies in both weighting and alternative evaluations. Different types of fuzzy sets may be deployed to model these uncertainties and compared to IFS. 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 A1 A2 A3 A4 A5 A6 A7 A8 A9 A10 Rank Alternatives Sensitivity Analysis Actual S1 S2 S3 Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management Istanbul, Turkey, March 7-10, 2022 IEOM Society International 1109","ilknur karacan, ismet karacan, and inanc erdogan an-el anahtar ve elektrikli ev aletleri san. a.s. pendik, 34896, turkey anelprs145@an-el.com.tr, anelprs142@an-el.com.tr, anel@an-el.com.tr ozlem senvar, serol bulkan department of industrial engineering marmara university maltepe, 34854, turkey ozlem.senvar@marmara.edu.tr, sbulkan@marmara.edu.tr","References

132,Effect Of Preventive Maintenance On Coffee Shop  Operations And Performance,the coffee shop and coffee beverage business in indonesia is booming in recent years. indonesia’s domestic coffee consumption also continues to rise. indonesian coffee shops grew 8% in 2018 and forecasted growth 15% until 20% until the end of 2019 (zuhriyah 2019). modern and forward-thinking enterprises treat maintenance as a profit center rather than a cost center. scheduled preventive maintenance will reduce the likelihood of machine downtime that can interfere with production (rachman and nurcahyo 2016). this study was conducted to determine the effect of preventive maintenance on the operations and performance of restaurants or coffee shops in jakarta. the methodology used is taking primary data with questionnaires. a total of 30 respondents from various coffee shop businesses with a working period profile is one to two years. the author divides the characteristics of preventive maintenance into 7 (seven) characters and correlates it with the operational performance of the coffee shop. the spss was used to see the opinions of the respondents whether the proposed criteria and sub-criteria deemed suitable or not with this study.,"coffee shop, small business","Maintenance scheduling is a process in which jobs are matched against resources (crafts) and given time slots for execution. (Duffuaa et al. 2019) divides maintenance scheduling into three stages based on the planning and execution time horizon. The stages are: (1) Long term or master schedule for a period of 3 months-1 year; (2) weekly schedule, i.e. maintenance work covering one week; and (3) a daily schedule that includes work to be completed each day. The elaboration at this stage is introduced below following (Duffuaa et al. 2019). The maintenance policy also has a significant correlation to performance. From the results of correlation analysis with SPSS, inspection, spare parts and materials, failure and downtime and planning and schedule have no correlation to performance.

133,Interactive Constraint-Based Configuration:  Hybridization Of Filtering And Compilation Approaches,"who has never wanted to own a particular product, such as shoes, smart-phone, cosmetic, car, etc., specially designed for him/her, perfectly suited to his/her desires, and affordable ? for several decades now, customers want to bring a personal touch to their products to make them special and unique. to meet this demand of personalization, companies nowadays no longer offer standard products, but more and more personalizable ones. thanks to the web technologies, this personalization is done directly and interactively online. customers can play with the range of choices and options offered by companies: they can assemble, cut, color, choose, ... visualize the result of their desires and ultimately order it, in a few minutes with a few clicks. this concept of personalization or configuration of products consists in assembling modules or predefined components, to produce a unique and specific product. for businesses, this is a way to offer personalized products to stand out from the competition and build customers’ loyalty through more accurately reflecting their tastes and needs. the major difficulty of personalization or configuration of products lies in managing the diversity offered to customers: how to be sure that all the combinations of choices, variants and options offered to the customers are achievable in a reasonable time and affordable price ? constraint satisfaction problems or csp are very often used to formalize product configuration problems in both research and industry. csp formalize relevant knowledge through variables, each one associated to a definition domain, linked by constraints, limiting the combinations of their permissible values. thus, csp makes it possible to describe exhaustively the solution space, corresponding to a set of all possible products. two different methods of processing csp allow to exploit the generic models in an interactive way: problem filtering methods (reasoning directly on the csp network and removing inconsistent values) and solution filtering methods (reasoning on a representation of the solution space in the form of a compiled graph). both of the methods have advantages and drawbacks in online product configuration. this paper aims at putting the first ideas on the joint use of these two methods in the same interactive configuration problem.","configuration, csp, compilation, turkey",,"idir boumbar, élise vareilles isae supaero toulouse, france idir.boumbar@isae.fr, elise.vareilles@isae.fr hélène fargier senior researcher for cnrs in artificial intelligence irit toulouse, france fargier@irit.fr paul gaborit, xavier lorca imt mines albi albi, france paul.gaborit@mines-albi.fr, xavier.lorca@mines-albi.fr","references and knowledge representation), at the algorithmic level

134,Artificial Intelligence: Insights Into Industrial Purchasing,"the use of artificial intelligence (ai) is crucial in a world where manufacturing is experiencing a digital transition and embracing the concept of industry 4.0. as manufacturing processes become increasingly automated and digitalized, new activities and departments must adapt and integrate in order to provide a pleasant work environment where machines and humans coexist. this is vital for a company's existence. ordering and purchasing, risk management related with the supplier and product being purchased, creation of vendor and supply chain processes, and performance analysis of the suppliers and vendors involved are all responsibilities performed by purchasing and supply chain management personnel. decades of outmoded buying procedures must be changed to be more effective and profitable in the digital world. the purpose of this article is to provide a high-level overview of artificial intelligence, its advantages and disadvantages, future possibilities, and how it can be integrated into purchasing and supply management processes to increase their effectiveness and efficiency while also improving their quality. as a result of this, research was done with buyers from a variety of significant industries, manufacturers, and other firms in austria. surveys and interviews were used as a research method and the data were collected by a questionnaire. the findings of this research show that numerous businesses are seeing the value of investing in artificial intelligence, regardless of whether it has been used in their operations. large amounts of procurement data collect over time and get spread across the organization, making it difficult for procurement firms to extract the maximum value from the data. given that the pandemic has reintroduced this, a kind of technology is necessary to reply more rapidly and remotely. artificial intelligence may be used to fill in for absent personnel or to perform typical job activities. in return, it frees up individuals to participate in activities that need their physical presence. this includes, but is not limited to, difficulties with creativity and interpersonal connections. this has the potential to result in the development of new employment. humans, on the other hand, will always be necessary for digitization and process standardization/simplification, since robots will always require maintenance. it was said that the older generation will struggle with it, whilst the next generation will not. children should be regarded since they are already growing up in a digitalized culture with constantly changing requirements. in their daily lives, ai will be woven into the fabric of human life and will be unavoidable. while this study helps us understand how ai may increase buying, performance, and new task completion, it has some limits. interviews and archive data are particularly valuable. other data sources and gathering techniques may be useful. future research should address this problem using ethnographic methodologies. proceedings of the international conference on industrial engineering and operations management istanbul, turkey, march 7-10, 2022 ieom society international 1194",,,"laila el shafie student of software engineering and management institute of business economics and industrial sociology graz university of technology graz, austria laila.elshafie@student.tugraz.at volker koch post - doc institute of business economics and industrial sociology faculty of mechanical engineering graz university of technology graz, austria volker.koch@tugraz.at",
135,Smart Gas Grid Concepts At Greener Energy Era,"as the adoption of the internet of things increases, cities are becoming smarter. for the past decade, gas distribution companies are also focusing on adopting smart city concepts such as smart metering. in the eve of transforming into a smart gas grid, igdas – the gas distribution utility company for a city of 15 million residents (istanbul), needed a literature review for analyzing the latest smart grid concepts. a systematic review was carried out on leading research databases. after applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 21 papers were selected to be included in the systematic review. out of those 21 papers, it became obvious that the greener energy era has shaped the research profile drastically toward the adoption of novel methods such as hybrid systems. the focus on cloud computing is on the rise as well as the novel ai methods for solving demand forecasting problems.","smart grid, iot, smart metering, green energy","and Future Work The starting point of the current research has been getting the latest state-of-the-art research on smart metering technology for gas utility companies. A systematic review approach was followed to find the related papers. Even though quite a high number of research articles found out that hybrid energy grids are the way to go, the industry has refrained from adopting hybrid energy models (e.g., gas and electric grid). One of the blockers of that adoption is different utility companies managing different resources. The business goals might be conflicting with the greener energy goals. Demand forecasting and management are still complex problem areas where different AI algorithms are applied. Some of the methods involved the application of game theory but none of the game theory solutions went live with real customers. As a result of this literature review, IGDAS has decided to apply IoT along with novel AI methods for demand forecasting and customer segmentation. The pilot project will also include the water utility company of Istanbul as well. In the future, the electric utility might also be incorporated into this hybrid system. As future work, we are planning to carry out a systematic mapping including all the papers from the original research (around 800 papers), where the results will be not only focusing on the most cited ones but include all the papers related to smart gas grids. Such a detailed article will reveal the research areas which have not been thoroughly investigated yet.

136,Mobile Vaccination Clinic Routing Problem,"accessing covid-19 vaccines may be challenging for people with disabilities, the elderly, which are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of covid-19 disease, and the population in rural areas. the utilization of mobile vaccination clinics is studied in this paper to overcome this challenge. a mathematical model is proposed to route mobile vaccination clinics over a network consisting of a depot, candidate stops, and demand points. different service levels are considered to ensure that the mobile vaccination clinic is located within a given distance of demand points. the population at demand points is divided into priority groups with varying criticalities and requirements for service levels. an extension to the location routing problem is proposed and an integer linear model is presented that optimizes the routes and stopping points of the mobile vaccination clinics. the objective is to maximize the coverage of prioritized groups while providing high service levels. a case study based on van province in turkey is conducted to analyze the proposed solution method. the preliminary results indicate a tradeoff between the prioritization of groups and the network-level effectiveness of the solution.","covid-19, healthcare, mobile clinic, location-routing","and Future Directions Implementation of Covid-19 vaccines has drastically lowered the infection rates, however, there are challenges on the administration of vaccines. One of the challenges is to vaccinate the population in remote areas, the immobile groups, and the groups that are vulnerable to the disease such as the elderly. In order to address this problem, An optimization- based solution is proposed that considers the different characteristics of location routing problems and the Covid-19 disease. An ILP model is developed to determine the daily routes of mobile vaccination clinics, as well as the service time at each stop, and the number of people to be vaccinated from each group. The preliminary results are presented including a sensitivity analysis on the parameters. The results indicate that there is a tradeoff to be considered between the prioritization of groups and the network-level effectiveness of the solution. A possible future extension to the proposed solution is to consider a multi-period setting, where MVCRP is solved repeatedly until all demand groups are fully vaccinated. In that case, in order to prevent unnecessary trips between depot and settlements, logistics costs may become an important aspect. Another promising extension is to take the stochasticity of demand into account, and the possibility of no-shows to appointments.","ecem yucesoy, elvin coban, burcu balcik department of industrial engineering ozyegin university istanbul, turkey ecem.yucesoy@ozu.edu.tr, elvin.coban@ozyegin.edu.tr, burcu.balcik@ozyegin.edu.tr",
137,Pricing Decisions In Revenue Management:  An Experimental Investigation,"behavioral studies in revenue management usually consider only the capacity allocation problem. in this paper, we study both pricing and capacity allocation decisions and report the findings of a decision-making experiment on a two- class revenue management problem. for simplicity we consider a scenario where for the first customer-class the price is predetermined and the demand is (practically) infinite. for the other customer class, the price and the reserved capacity are determined by the decision-makers. under one treatment, subjects decide on only the price where the reserved capacity is automatically and optimally determined by the software. under the other treatment, subjects determine both the price and the reserved capacity simultaneously. we consider two different levels for the predetermined first customer class price; high and low. our findings indicate that on average pricing decisions are not significantly different from the optimal even when the complexity of the task is increased by a second decision. on the other hand, capacity decisions deviate from the optimal significantly and systematically resulting in a “too-low- too-high” pattern.",revenue management,"that the decision makers are not very good at making simultaneous decisions, especially capacity allocation decisions, in complex environments. Hence, as argued in earlier studies, decision support tools will be helpful in improving the performance of the decision makers in such environments (Ramachandran et al. 2018). However, rather than providing the decision makers with classic decision support systems that only provide demand forecasts and other relevant information, it might be more beneficial to induce tools that also detect consistent deviations in one’s decisions over time and inform the decision maker accordingly. These deviations are often in the form of an anchoring behavior, i.e. being affected by the irrelevant values present in the system (e.g. the price of a similar product, the average demand of the past periods, etc.) Moreover, the companies could establish training programs for the decision makers to make them aware of the possible behavioral biases as the ones noted in this study. In some complex environments, even automatizing some of the decisions might be considered to improve the overall decision quality. Hence, our results indicate that using smarter decision support tools which show the consistent deviations in one’s decisions or even make some decisions automatically could be beneficial in complex, joint decision-making settings. 6. Conclusion In this article, we present an experimental study of the pricing strategies in classical two-class revenue management problem. Our study contributes to the behavioral revenue management literature by investigating the alignment of pricing decisions of human decision makers with the theoretical RM benchmarks. The main takeaway from our study is that the number of decisions to be made at each instance affects the decision- making process. In particular, although our subjects manage to make pricing decisions similar to the values prescribed by the normative theory, they performed poorly in setting the protection levels when they had to make joint decisions. It is true that advanced optimization techniques and software are used in pricing and revenue management and the amount of automation is increasing day by day. However, human judgement is still a crucial component of the decision process in all business contexts.

138,Asset Management Models Brief Review And Framework  Development For Energy Sustainability & Sustainable,"despite, other operational disciplines like projects, risk, health & safety, environment, and quality management have a variety of global frameworks and models, asset and maintenance management has just recently been created. to help practitioners recognize the variables and constructs that might support decisions towards effective and efficient physical asset management, a variety of organizations, groups, consultancies, and researchers have provided numerous models, terminologies, and frameworks. according to global forum on maintenance & asset management (gfmam) most recent framework, ensuring the asset value is effectively exploited requires considering sustainability as one of the principal components. although companies have clearly established processes for asset management, there has not been a comprehensive framework to link physical asset management systems with energy sustainability towards meeting sustainable development objectives. with the growing demand for energy and the resulting worries about the reliability of associated asset that employs these energies to generate value for the organization, global asset sustainability becomes necessary. a sound business technique is no longer asset efficient if the energy performance that goes along with it, is not understood. using asset management systems to achieve sustainable development is still not thoroughly and independently investigated, both in industry practice and academic study. continuous enhancement of asset management systems under the context of sustainability requires a robust study and framework that will allow organizations to understand the various established subject groups and principles within the performance of asset management system and their contribution towards sustainability– thereby ensuring that: (i) the 6 subject groups and 39 principles of the asset management landscape by gfmam are evaluated based on their influence on the energy sustainability & sustainable development perspective: and (ii) organizational major targets and performance indicators under these subject groups are aligned in the context of sustainable development. the following issues will be addressed in this paper: the current state of energy sustainability measured and how they can be linked to asset management system performance, and how can this be tied back to business performance.","asset management, energy",,"development joseph akpan1, oludolapo akanni olanrewaju2 department of industrial engineering durban university of technology durban, sa 22176142@dut4life.ac.za1, oludolapoo@dut.ac.za2","References

139,Acceptance Expectancy For Cognitive Assistance Systems  Variants In Smart Factories,"this study intended to gain initial insights into which technical design options of cognitive assistance systems for manual assembly are predicted to have a higher acceptance between future potential users. the methodology is based on combining previously obtained results, indicating which acceptance factors are the most important in this field, together with new generated data with the same participants on the appreciated relevance of relationships between these factors and today existing technical design options. combining both results numerically enables a final qualitative statement about preference tendencies inside each of those technical assistance aspects of cognitive systems, identified by experts as the most relevant for potential future users. the results show a higher acceptance tendency for hand-carried/mobile, documentation-based, dialogical assistance systems with a high adjustment level for the assistance, a selective assistance frequency, an intervention module both while work process and by the result as well as a task-oriented assistance and the omission of at least personal-related data. based on these results, planners should be able to find better orientation, when designing a cognitive assistance systems for manual assembly.",however,"Anticipating to future challenges in work production is one of the most valuable contributions in Industry 4.0 research. Increasing complexity in manufacturing and the following cognitive load on employees need to be compensated through the introduction of cognitive assistance systems in production that support employees in their daily tasks. The multiple design options for such systems challenge engineers and so far, most previous research approaches have just focused on enabling the technical implementation of the systems, without considering the impact of specific design options on acceptance related factors at all. Therefore, the objective of this study was the linkage evaluation between already validated acceptance factors and specific technical configuration options of cognitive assistance systems as well as their prioritisation across all acceptance factors in sum. The following objectives were defined:  Translation of acceptance needs into design options for cognitive assistance systems in manual assembly processes  Prioritisation of configuration options for cognitive assistance systems in manual assembly processes. To accomplish both objectives, first in literature as-relevant coded assistance aspects, including specific technical design options, were selected and then sorted by a group of experts according to their suspected relationship with previously validated acceptance factors. Then, the specific user preferences were tested via survey. To obtain high- quality valid data, the survey just included potential future users of cognitive assistance systems as participants. The results show different fulfilment grades of the acceptance factors by each technical configuration option. Besides, it could be concluded that there is a higher acceptance tendency for hand-carried/mobile, documentation-based, dialogical assistance systems with a high adjustment level for the assistance, a selective assistance frequency, an intervention module both while work process and by the result as well as a task-oriented assistance and the omission of at least personal-related data. Based on these results, planners should be able to find better orientation, when designing a cognitive assistance systems for manual assembly. Moreover, the proposed improvements in this paper should as well be taken into consideration in the future. Accurate statistical methods to calculate effectively precise correlations by simultaneous inclusion of larger numbers of participants and the iteration towards more specific design options (Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, Pick-by-Light, etc.) of the assembly systems represent the next challenges.","bastian pokorni and christian saba department of connected manufacturing systems fraunhofer institute for industrial engineering iao university of stuttgart, institute of human factors and technology management (iat) stuttgart, germany bastian.pokorni@iao.fraunhofer.de, christian-oswaldo.saba-gayoso@iao.fraunhofer.de",
140,Comparative Statistical Analysis Of Supplier Performance  For A Retailer,"the critical role of supply chain management for the well-being of communities all around the world has been highlighted as a result of a multitude of disruptions, including natural or man-made disasters, pandemics, and geopolitical uncertainties, in recent years. supply chain management (scm) coordinates the flow of material, information, and services across functions and across companies. supply chain disruptions have become more frequent, and the external and internal risks on supply chains should be considered more seriously to prepare for such shocks better. supplier performance measurement is one of the most crucial processes to identify risks by quantifying the efficiency and effectiveness of supplier actions. in this study, the performances of three critical suppliers of a footwear retail company are statistically analyzed to identify the risks and to propose actions for improvement. normality tests are applied to the supplier data to determine the appropriate hypothesis testing procedures. due to the lack of normality in the data, kruskal-wallis test is performed to compare the performances of the three suppliers in terms of order delivery delay time measured in days and the number of split deliveries. the statistical analysis reveals important risks regarding over-reliance on suppliers with low service performance levels.",supply chain,"Given all the uncertainties and risks involved in the current global marketplace, choosing reliable suppliers as partners, especially in the rapidly growing e-commerce market, is becoming more important. Supplier performance measurement systems are necessary for quantifying and monitoring the efficiency and effectiveness of suppliers’ actions. Although several studies focus on supplier performance measurement, there are still research questions that can be explored and there is still room for improvement for many firms in practice. A statistical analysis of the supplier performance for a footwear retailer is presented in this study to provide insights about the shortcomings of the current state and to propose actions for the improvement of supply operations. The service performance metrics of three suppliers determined as the number of split deliveries and delay time are compared based on historical data. The differences between suppliers in service performance are identified, such as the significantly worse delay time performance of Supplier 2 and the significantly high performance of Supplier 3. Based on these results, reducing the number and size of orders made with Supplier 1 and 2 while utilizing the capacity of Supplier 3 more is suggested. This type of statistical analysis can be extended in the presence of additional data on supplier performance such as the logistical costs, lead times, distances, or responsiveness. More informed decisions can be made by considering several other criteria. Such analyses are valuable for retailers to understand the extent of service capacity of suppliers and to manage expectations accordingly. For retail companies to gain an edge over competitors in the marketplace, quantitative and statistical analyses are expected to remain essential for resilient supply chains in the future.","esra agca aktunc assistant professor of industrial engineering faculty of engineering and natural sciences kadir has university istanbul, turkey esra.agca@khas.edu.tr",
141,“The Influence Of Various E-Learning Techniques Upon  Technology Acceptance And Student Engagement In Differing,"the impact of technology is becoming increasingly relevant in its everyday use amongst a variety of different industries and practices. this most prominently includes educational systems and services. as a direct result of the on-going covid-19 pandemic, the majority of students and educators have had to relocate unto online platforms. therefore the implementation and acceptance of such technological resources has become widespread in its outreach. through the understanding and usage of predictive theories presented in technology acceptance models (davis, 1989), research review processes have suggested that student acceptance, engagement and retention of such essential technological tools varies based upon factors adjacent to motivation. the influence of motivation and interest to partake in the technology presented to them as well as balance in activities and opportunities made available to them can directly impact a student’s perception of their capabilities and subsequently their performance within a learning environment. by understanding the factors which directly impact and influence a student’s motivation and perception towards education. this can further allow educators and creators to structure educational technologies and tools for students of all educational levels, backgrounds and capabilities in the future.","virtual, learning, technology, acceptance","Overall, the benefits brought forth by virtual education are those which provide long-term benefits to students simply due to the accessibility it provides. As technological devices were introduced to facilitate curriculum throughout the COVID-19 pandemic will not cease to exist as society moves forward (Lieberman, 2020). Rather it will become increasingly integral as students will become more equipped than ever in asserting their autonomy within their education. They will have more resources available to them, not just the ones that are made available due to their zip-code or which tax bracket their families fit into. Education is often depicted as privilege, while it can and should be treated as a fundamental necessity and right when it comes to the equity of every individual who wishes to access it (Rocco & West, 1998). Therefore, denying students an additional opportunity to access their education through non-traditional (or physical) means is denying them an opportunity to access what was theirs to begin with. While the benefits established by technology can also be illustrated as exponential or bountiful, it cannot be successfully implemented, especially for children, without assuring that their educators are not being left behind.","classroom environments” tasfia bari m.s. doctoral student eastern michigan university college of technology ypsilanti, michigan tbari@emich.edu munther abualkibash eastern michigan university college of technology school of information security and applied computing ypsilanti, michigan mabualki@emich.edu",
142,Production Planning Perspective For  Hybrid Manufacturing–Remanufacturing,"recycling for used products, collected from customers for recycling and disassembly of them for remanufacturing, is very critical addressing of the sustainable manufacturing systems. the concept of remanufacturing, which is frequently used for the production stages of electronic parts, especially in the automotive sector, is preferred for reducing costs, increasing efficiency, and legal regulations. we discussed the operation of a hybrid manufacturing system that uses raw materials and returned products together in the production process in this paper. this type of system has system complexity compared with the traditional manufacturing systems. besides such challenges, remanufacturing can provide economic value considering sustainable benefits, as it preserves the geometric shape of the product.",remanufacturing,"We discussed remanufacturing systems and their complexities concerning production planning and control concepts. The main and most important difficulty for planning and controlling activities in the remanufacturing systems is the uncertainty issue. There are many uncertain components in the remanufacturing systems, such as quantity, lead time, quality requirements, repair time, repair requirements, additional investment requirements, managing the system performance, and other decision-making requirements. So, the development of the methodologies that capture the uncertainty component and model of them is necessary for today's sustainable, competitive, and complex production systems. For future studies, researchers can be developed such models to improve the remanufacturing production system performances.","systems yusuf tansel ic, esra dinler and kumru didem atalay department of industrial engineering faculty of engineering baskent university ankara, turkey yustanic@baskent.edu.tr, edinler@baskent.edu.tr, katalay@baskent.edu.tr",

There are many motivations behind: Value recovery from used products, new regulations, globally increasing environmental awareness of customers, and to have an environmentally friendly company image. Different material recovery options exist but remanufacturing is the only process where the quality standard becomes as good as a new product. Mercedes-Benz have been using remanufacturing techniques in Germany for a long time. Products are produced for ease of disassembly. Cores are collected from the Mercedes-Benz dealers and stored in the factory. Customer can buy remanufactured engines from the dealers. Reman parts lower costs with Mercedes-Benz quality. They are remanufactured to the highest quality standards as original Mercedes-Benz parts and then verified within internal assessment facilities. By remanufacturing in its production plant in Istanbul/Turkey, Mercedes started to produce engines at a more affordable price. In this way, it delivers high quality engines to more customers at low prices.","adnan corum department of industrial engineering bahcesehir university istanbul, turkey",

150,Dynamic Modeling Of Line Start Permanent Magnet Assistance  Synchronous Reluctance By Different Rotor Designs For Industrial And,"recent studies show that line start permanent magnet assistance synchronous reluctance (ls- pma-synrms) present promising technologies because of their advantages such as simple structure and minimized amount of permanent magnet. moreover, the ls-pma-synrms can operate with direct start for net voltage or drive by power converter with torque control methods. especially, the ls-pma-synrm has higher irreversible demagnetization level than ipm because it has less permanent magnet in rotor slots. this paper will develop different rotor designing and modeling of a line-start permanent magnet assistance synchronous reluctance motor (ls-pma-synrm) with permanent magnets arrangement in i-w-u type using both industrial and ev applications. the dynamic speed and torque performances are analyzed and compared by finite element analysis fea. the performance of ls-pma-synrm is analyzed considering the position and i-w-u shape of its permanent magnet, as well as its manufacture. the proposal model of ls-pma-synrm has been improved efficiency, torque, and output power. finally, the ls-pma-synrm with u layered magnets rotor is prototyped to verify by full efficiency map to evaluate evs application.",ls-pma-synrm,"This paper has analyzed and compared the electromagnetic performance of three multi-layered LS_PMA-SYNRM machines for industrial and traction applications.

152,Active Heat Sinks Design And Optimization Of Rru 5G  Considering Wind Speed Condition,"remote radio unit (rru) is the main part of the 5g base station that has a great size with a high density of chipsets and be operated with significantly high temperature. this paper introduces an optimization protocol of geometric parameters of heat sink on thermal dissipation for rru 5g 8t8r operation at 2600mhz. firstly, the heat sink is calculated by analytical method with minimization of entropy energy. in the next step, two more prototypes of heat sink are proposed to consider their performance on thermal dissipation. the simulation results demonstrated that in general, the heat sink with v-shaped fin has the better performance on thermal dissipation in comparison to conventional models such as in-line arrangement fin heat sinks. an optimal heatsink for rru 5g have been simulated by fem method considering different working conditions such as wind speed and high attitudes.",high reliability,"This paper has implemented FEM simulation and experiment methods for RRU 5G heatsink embedded vapor chamber and heat pipe to improve heat transfer efficiency. This research illustrated that V shape heatsink fin with vapor chamber and assemblies is potentially applied for the industry. 3D Thermal simulations have been carried out to find out the best V shape angle. The thermal performance of heat sinks design under forced convection, varying geometric and boundary parameters (inlet velocity and heat source temperature), was conducted by computational fluid dynamics simulation with ANSYS ICE park. Considering heat sinks with fins configuration, it was found out that the thickness of the fins should be as thin as possible and widely spaced. The optimal design is obtained by an agreement between both parameters. The wind speed has a greater impact on the pressure drop, the bigger fins spacing (2.5 mm) was considered for studies related to the wind speed of 1.5m/s. For this last iteration on the shape configuration, all geometric and boundary parameters were kept constant, varying only in heat sinks design. It was found that radial fins designed with V shape have great advantages and the design was the one with better performance. Finally, the RRU 5G heat sink with V-shaped fins was applied to fabricate and measure temperatures in the lab by supporting Viettel High Technology Industries Corporation, Vietnam Acknowledgment: This work was supported by project “Viettel Remote Radio Unit 5G”, Viettel High Technology-VHT, Viettel Military Industry and Telecoms Group, Vietnam)","1minh dinh bui viettel high technology industries corporation dinh.buiminh@hust.edu.vn 2duc-thinh nguyen, quoc hung nguyen and van manh khong 2department of mechanical engineering viettel high technology industries corporation, hanoi, vietnam. thinhnd28@viettel.com.vn, hungnd52@viettel.com, manhkv@viettel.com.vn,",
153,Estimating Remaining Useful Life Under Multiple  Operational Conditions Using Ensemble Learning,"prognostics is an important part of advanced manufacturing and maintenance. recently, many sensors have been adopted for monitoring units before the end of their cycle time. also, this sensor data is usually noisy and correlated which is challenging for traditional techniques to capture the information and estimate the remaining useful life (rul). in practical cases, there are many operational conditions that the unit goes through which also complicate the task of estimating rul. to encounter these challenges, an ensemble learning model could be used to extract the correlated information and predict the rul. ensemble learning models produce many weak learners each learns part from the data, and in the end, these weak learners vote to get the best prediction possible.","machine learning, ensemble learning, prognostics","To sum up, this paper addressed multi-sensor multi-operational condition prognostics using a tree-based ensemble learning models. By using the simulated aircraft engine degradation dataset, ensemble models approach showed significant savings in computational time although there was a small drop in the accuracy. Based on the application required the needs an estimation for RUL, there could be a tradeoff between the accuracy and the computational cost. Note that with highly correlated data, PCA failed to capture the important information and reflect it on the model. Also, feature selection based on regularized regression techniques produced poor models. In the future, the normality assumptions could be checked to build prediction and confidence intervals. Also, the time component in each unit could be exploited and modeled instead of taking the data as cross-sectional data. Moreover, the models introduced could be fitted on a larger dataset to check the accuracy and computational time, especially, finding if the neural network will converge in commodity hardware.

An increase in the pitch angles of the blades from the top to the bottom will increase the operating efficiency of the propeller. On the other hand, the results of a few other configurations indicate that one of the rotors may be either inefficient or subtracting the power and lift. This depends on the combinations of the pitch angles of the three rotors. This fact, in addition to the mechanical complications of three rotors, the variable- pitch hub makes the three rotors propeller critical. In any case, further analyses are required.","merve sali department of industrial engineering alma mater studiorum university of bologna viale risorgimento, 2 – 40136, bologna, italy merve.sali2@unibo.it",

It fulfills its role in detecting the suitable stressor for a particular tweet based on the hashtag using the methods of topic modeling. It also saw have a method to create a data model for stressor detection and the prediction that would have 70-71% performance among the three models, The reason why each model is like each other is that the algorithm of the model primarily focuses on multiclass predictions. The model that performed the best was Logistic Regression (71%) in our study because the algorithm prioritizes posterior class probability and is very effective on a linear classification problem. For future work, the researchers recommend mining tweets in different countries in the same generalized topic if possible since mining the same topic on the same area (area-specific topics) to compare two different languages will fall to code-switching. The researchers also suggest using a better cleaning method if there is one created in terms of Tagalog text because data cleaning for Tagalog text seems to be minimal compared to other languages and does not have a dedicated function. The researchers also suggest having other similarities-based methods to find stressors and other NLP techniques to make a cluster for the stressor creating.

158,Horace: A Digital Classroom Management  Software For Computer Laboratories,"computer laboratories are met with tedious and time-consuming tasks. significantly, these tasks affect students' learning curves. therefore, this research aims to solve time-consuming, repetitive methods by developing digital classroom management software; horace. a software evaluation survey was done. it is for teachers that are teaching non-computer-related subjects. on the software evaluation, the functionality (x̄ =3.15, σ=0.33) of the software gained the highest approval among the participants to be followed by efficacy (x̄ =3.11, σ=0.31), usability (x̄ =3.08, σ=0.28), and reliability (x̄ =3.05, σ=0.18). moreover, all factors gained a descriptive interpretation of agree. in conclusion, the software is effective and efficient in terms of their teaching in computer laboratories, assisting the teachers and the students in an effective transfer of knowledge towards achieving the desired goal and competencies.",digital classroom,"With the advancement of technology, school computer laboratories and computer teachers must also catch up with its fast-phasing changes. Amidst the pandemic, video conferencing sites (e.g., Zoom and Google meet) have become a household name. Different software features like share screen, private chat, whiteboard, mute, etc., are helpful tools in video conferencing sites. As face-to-face classes are being slowly implemented in some areas with low cases of Covid-19, these software features must also be adapted in computer laboratories for a better learning experience. Horace aims to provide efficient computer laboratory management software to effectively enhance the students' learning experience and teachers' pedagogies. Based on the respondents' evaluation in terms of functionality, reliability, usability, and efficacy, it was evaluated effective and efficient by the teacher-respondents. First, the functionality of the software gained the highest mean rating. According to Moumane et al. (2016), functional correctness is defined as the output being identical to the input with a possible minor mistake. With the rise of big data, the web environment, and cloud computing, efficiency and accuracy difficulties in data processing have become a key concern for software functionality services (Norzaidi, Chong, Salwani, and Lin 2016). The program Horace has shown high functionality among the respondents in terms of performing the tasks required, showing the result as expected, interacting with another system, and can prevent unauthorized access. Second, efficiency has typically been defined in the context of software development as the ratio of functionality, measured in lines of code or function points, to effort invested (Chinubhai 2016). According to the respondents, Horace quickly responds and utilizes resources efficiently. Improved efficiency results in increased production, shorter product life cycles, reduced time to market, and, eventually, a higher bottom line (Kumar 2020). Third, based on the respondents, the usability of the software management system overall interface looks good, enabling the respondents to know how to use the system quickly and without much effort. A programmer's quality- oriented mindset implies that they should always consider methods to improve the software's quality. A developer must be user-oriented. They must constantly think about user needs to attain an appropriate quality of software (Uddin, Azeem and Anand, Abhineet 2019). Lastly, software reliability refers to the chance of software operating without failure for a certain amount of time in a specified environment. Reliability estimate enables the determination of the number of losses that occur over a particular period, the mean life of software, and the primary cause of failure, among other things (Uddin, Azeem and Anand, Abhineet 2019). The management software showed no faults or bugs in the software, that it is capable of handling errors, and that it is capable of resuming work and restoring lost data after a failure.

159,A Framework To Develop And Evaluate Circular Economy  Readiness Within The Rail Sector,"the circular economy (ce) brings together the key aspects of sustainable development by creating solutions for environmental protection and economic gains. it is evident from the research that existing approaches do not rely upon systems thinking and therefore lack the holistic approach necessary to optimise ce value.the aim of this research project assesses the drivers and blockers for ce adoption within the context of the effective deployment of systems thinking in relation to the concept of a circular economic management system that promotes ce competition. the scope of research has focussed on ce deployment within asset management iso 55000 series of standards. however, during the course of the literature review it became apparent that the context of asset management systems are driven by business goals. if the business goals did not value the adoption of themes for example ce activity then the asset management system would not be obliged to consider them. this is a missed opportunity. systems theory/thinking is a prerequisite for effective deployment of ce. for the purposes of this research it will focus on the deployment of systems theory/thinking with the deployment of ce within the rail sector as a proxy, within an asset management context. the findings can be assimilated across multiple sectors. this study is based upon a comprehensive literature review of the incentives for ce activity within the rail sector. this research will contribute towards future research that looks to develop a circular economic readiness framework for the rail sector.","circular economy, system thinking",,"carl waring, kapila liyanage college of science and engineering university of derby, derby, de22 3aw, uk c.waring@derby.ac.uk, k.liyanage@derby.ac.uk","References

160,Comparing Alns And Nsga-Ii On Bi-Objective Travelling  Thief Problem,"real-life optimization problems consist of various conflicting optimization problems. due to the interdependency of these sub-optimization problems, their solution is more difficult than single optimization problems. for this reason, most of the real-life optimization problems are considered multi-objective optimization problems by nature, and different methods and approaches are applied. in this paper, a recent multi-objective optimization problem, the bi- objective travelling thief problem (bittp) was studied. two state-of-the-art algorithms, alns and nsga-ii, were hybridized with certain local search methods and applied on six problem instances of polyakovskiy’s problem benchmark set. as a result, the performances of these two algorithms were evaluated and a new set of pareto front sets were generated for the related benchmark instances.",nsga-ii,"In this paper, one of the state-of-the-art problems, BiTTP, was studied. Although there are many studies for single objective TTP, the bi-objective version of the TTP has recently been an attraction to researchers. BiTTP is closer to real-life problems but it is more difficult to solve due to its multi-objective nature. In this paper, these two objectives for BiTTP were taken into consideration: maximizing the total profit of the picked items and minimizing the total travel time of the thief. Two state-of-the-art algorithms, ALNS and NSGA-II, were hybridized with certain local search methods and applied on six problem instances of Polyakovskiy’s problem benchmark set. The experimental results show the outperforming performance of NSGA-II over ALNS in the BiTTP studied in this paper. The main reason for this conclusion is mostly because of NSGA-II’s use of population in the search process. NSGA-II can simultaneously evaluate multiple solutions in its population. Although this is an advantage for NSGA- II over ALNS, handling a population at each iteration extends the iteration time which in turn decreases the number of iterations. This fact can be very disadvantageous for NSGA-II when running on the instances having much higher 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000 7000 8000 7500 17500 27500 37500 47500 57500 67500 Profit Travel Time ALNS NSGA-II 0 5000 10000 15000 20000 25000 30000 35000 40000 45000 2500 3500 4500 5500 6500 7500 8500 Profit Travel Time ALNS NSGA-II Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management Istanbul, Turkey, March 7-10, 2022 IEOM Society International 1433","kazım erdoğdu department of software engineering faculty of engineering yaşar university i̇zmir, turkey kazim.erdogdu@yasar.edu.tr","References

161,Ecosystem Determinants Of Height And Weight Among  Poverty Ridden Children In India,"the 2020 global nutrition report by unicef highlights the high rate of deaths among children under five years of age, with india being one of the top five countries. studies suggest that more than half of these early child deaths were attributable to health issues associated with malnutrition, particularly in the case of countries with extreme poverty, scarcity of essential resources, lack of access to appropriate healthcare, and wide disparities of wealth. we situated our analysis on the lines of bronfenbrenner’s ecological systems theory and interpreted the results through the lens of this theory.observations from 70618 children between ages of 2-5 years old, from poverty ridden communities in india, were used. the poverty ridden households contain poorer and poorest populations classified by dhs based on wealth index. three measures, namely, stunted, wasted, underweight and overweight were calculated according to who child growth standards, and used as dependent variables. the independent variables include child’s biological characteristics, health status, dietary adequacy. we also analyzed the role of maternal factors such as mother’s anthropometry, health status, education, access to healthcare facilities. in addition, the variables include home environmental conditions, social welfare systems and geographical location. binary logistic regression model two sets of multinomial logistic regression models were developed for the analyses. we found that a child’s health, particularly anaemia levels, vaccination and multivitamin access play a vital role in influencing a child’s anthropometric measurements. moreover, dietary diversity has a crucial role to play in forming a child’s height and weight. finally, we conclude that maternal factors including health status (anaemia levels and anthropometric measurements) and access to healthcare facilities significantly influence a child’s likelihood to experience malnutrition. three levels, namely, microsystem, mesosystem and exosystem of the bronfenbrenner’s ecological systems theory emerge as most significant contributors to the likelihood of malnutrition. implications for policymakers include importance of access to healthcare as basic determinant of child well-being can help mothers to maintain and improve their health status and prevent the health issues which has direct impact on likelihood of children malnutrition.",,,"bita afsharinia senior research scholar department of management studies indian institute of science, bangalore, india bitaa@iisc.ac.in anjula gurtoo professor, department of management studies chairperson, centre for society and policy indian institute of science, bangalore, india anjula@iisc.ac.in",

163,The Framework Of Plantation Leadership:  An Insight From Indonesia,"the complexity of the business environment today becomes a factor behind the evolution followed by traditional leadership due to no longer effective and should be changed. planters who are the spearhead of the palm oil plantation have not been able to provide the maximum role in a plantation and losing their effectiveness. this qualitative research aims to develop the framework of plantation leadership in the global era and technological development. thirty-three informants in the palm oil plantation industry in indonesia were observed and interviewed then verified to a detailed and in-depth exploration of documents. the framework is defined by adjusting the leadership evolution process. it encourages the leadership capability in task orientation with a people-oriented approach and improves the competencies, which consist of managerial competencies, functional competencies, and leadership competencies. it is necessary to formulate and detail action plans to fill stakeholder expectation gaps on planter’s leadership, a thorough evaluation of field training curriculum or assistant trainee programs and immediately formulate and agree on planter competency standards that will become a reference for the palm oil plantation industry.",planters,"The evolution of leadership in the plantation industry was started from authoritarian leadership in the beginning period of the industry, followed by democratic leadership after the transformation era, and participatory leadership at this moment. The capability of plantation leadership depends on a leader-follower relationship. Task-oriented in the plantation leadership is needed without ignoring the people-oriented approach. It needs a long process and integration of the background of family and education, working condition and environment, work ethic and passion. The plantation leaders adapt in mindset, technical abilities, leadership behavior, and approach methods. The plantation leader must sensitive and aware of global issues which are technology and innovations development. It is the required competency related to the complexity in the plantation industry besides core competencies, managerial competencies, and functional competencies.

173,Exploring Non-Motorized Transport As A Transport  System: Lessons From Thohoyandou Cbd.,"globally, transportation has always encouraged diversity in growth and development. conversations have revolved on issues of current and future sustainability in the built environment. non-motorized transport is one of the key dimensions of sustainable transportation. exploring differentiated and nuanced understanding on how nmt support transportation sector norms and standards in respect to creating just, equitable and sustainable communities and societies is key for overall development. sustainable provision of nmt infrastructure and services has remained a stubborn challenge for municipalities throughout south africa. the location and quality of non-motorized transport systems plays a pivotal role in promoting sustainable flows and movement of people, goods, and services. the majority of nmt systems and infrastructure often face neglect by municipalities, are coupled with poor implementation tactics as reflected by inadequate expression in their spatial development frameworks (sdfs) and lack of a critical mass of nmt projects to enhance high impact implementation of nmt projects, programmes, and activities. the paper discusses the failures and issues surrounding non-motorized transport at a local level. the paper concludes by observing the critical need for local government to rethink the concept of non-motorized transport as a sub-discipline to motorized transport.",infrastructure,"The transportation system in the Thohoyandou CBD is not up to par in terms of creating a conducive structure to enable growth in all kinds of transportation options. The growth and usages of motorized vehicles need to be curbed with the development of alternative transportation modes. Key focus should be given to NMT modes. NMT modes can assist in instilling the element of sustainable transport and assist in alleviating the one-way traffic system in the Thohoyandou CBD. NMT infrastructure and services integration and alignment with the surrounding environments of Thulamela Municipality is evidently poor and miss-aligned with the wider town and district transportation system. Additionally, inadequate and grey literature on NMT has seemingly caused the poor development of NMT in Thohoyandou CBD despite the apparent recognition by the municipality of the importance and need to develop NMT infrastructure and services. In the study area, although fragments of poor implementation and practices in respect of standards for NMT modes were discovered, several functions of NMT act as a foundation on the ‘WHY’ reason NMT should be prioritised. Respondents unanimously argued for the need to have NMT being taken up high into the integrated development plan (IDP), integrated transport plan (ITP) and NMT municipal plans as a serious and important alternative and complementary mode of transportation to motorised travel that requires full development. The study concludes by recognizing the positive impact a well- developed NMT brings in the transportation system and in the quality of living for users.

174,Comparative Analysis Of Social Media Activities On Local  Skincare Brands In Indonesia During The Covid-19,"improvements in things done using instagram have now made various skincare brands reach the broader community with two-way communication. the business value proposition of skincare brands requires a customer-centered approach that can understand their needs, wants, expectations, preferences, and behaviors. generally, social media analytics tools for instagram have three main features, namely activity, audience, and content in the form of data visualization. the result of visualizing data from instagram analytics is called engagement. instagram engagement are numbers that show the two-way interaction between the audience and the brand through their official instagram account. the primary purpose of this scientific article is to analyze the comparison of instagram engagement on well- known local skincare brands in indonesia during the covid-19 pandemic, and to identify the factors that influence the engagement of the skincare brand’s instagram account audience. this scientific article using qualitative research methods, from several previous research journal articles and data visualization results from social media analytics tool, namely analisa.io. the results of this scientific article obtained three main factors that influence the engagement of the instagram account audience on skincare brands, including: (1) brand awareness and brand image, (2) parasocial interaction, (3) brand post or type of content.","instagram, engagement","It is important to analyze the comparison of engagement on Instagram against well-known local skincare brands in Indonesia during the COVID-19 pandemic to identify the factors that influence the skincare brand’s Instagram account engagement audience. We can conclude that it has been proven that a large number of followers does not affect the success of a brand if the audience does not consume the content. There is no good interaction between audience and brand, so that it is assessed through engagement and has been proven to be parasocial Interaction through brand ambassadors, namely well-known media figures who are currently very popular, can increase engagement with likes and comments. These Likes and Comments can guide brands to determine the best time to post their promotional content. And can be found and identified three leading indicators or factors that influence the engagement or enthusiasm of the audience for the skincare brand Instagram account including: (1) Brand Awareness and Brand Image are needed to give consumers confidence in buying a product or service, (2) Parasocial Interaction because it can lead the public to form interactions with well-known media figures so that it will have a positive impact on a brand when collaborating with artists, actors, and public figures, (3) Brand Post or Type of Content to attract an enthusiast audience by posting photos/video that contains colorful framing and aesthetic images.

175,The Impact Of Servitization On Manufacturing Industry: A  Literature Review And Prospects For Future Research,"the manufacturing strategy should be dynamic in order to adapt to the changes. one example of change is the customer’s preference influenced by service. the involvement of service in the manufacturing industry has resulted in a new term, i.e., servitization. this paper aims to investigate the effect of servitization on the manufacturing industry by reviewing 29 journals. in addition, the selected journals are mapped in accordance with the similarity of the discussion topics. based on the literature review, it is generally concluded that the involvement of services in the manufacturing industry has a major influence on manufacturing strategy. the integration between products and services causes a mix that sometimes does not see the boundaries between products and services themselves. in general, servitization is defined as the tendency of manufacturing companies to integrate services into their manufactured tangible products. furthermore, this review of the literature can be used to identify future research opportunities. some future research topics that are visible to carry out are the effectiveness of the role of service embedded in a product, the way to determine the amount of service dominance in a product, and the cost-benefit ratio analysis to integrate product and service.","servitization, future research","Based on the description of the development of servitization trends affecting the development of the manufacturing strategy above, several important points can be noted as follows: a. In regard to the increasing involvement of service in the manufacturing industry, several previous studies have proposed the definition of servitization and examined the limitations of servitization itself. From several previous studies, various definitions of servitization were obtained. However, in general it can be concluded that servitization is the tendency of manufacturing companies to integrate services into the manufactured tangible products. The existence of integration between products and services causes a mix that sometimes does not see the boundaries between the product and the service itself. Therefore, further research is required to determine the level of service added to the product so that the efforts to integrate products and services become effective. b. The involvement of service in the manufacturing industry has a big influence on the shift in customer tastes. Eventually, it forced the manufacturing company to adjust the selected business strategy. The shift in customer tastes is caused by additional value to the product that is acquired by the customer. Therefore, many manufacturing companies are transitioning from manufacturing products to integrating products and services. c. Currently, there are many studies that discuss product and service systems as an alternative manufacturing strategy. Some examples of these research topics are the product and service system development framework, product and service system evaluation, product and service system design case studies and the others. Research on the design and development of PSS will always be connected with the development of servitization trends that have a global impact.

During this period, many MTBF and MTTR still have not reached the target. The root of the problem that causes Downtime on Gas Engines is caused by the breakdown of parts or components on Gas Engines. The identification results of the root cause indicate that the Gas Engine is damaged in two Zones. Namely, Zone 1 - Engine System, namely emissions from combustion sticking and the Carburetor or Injection is not reset, Dust and dirt accumulate, oil mixed with iron flakes (dirt), friction between the Fly Wheel and Crank Shaft, a lot of dirt (Dust) that obstructs the air inflow, the fuel setting is too low, and the fuel injection is dirty. Meanwhile, in Zone 2 – Radiator or Cooling System, there is a lack of lubrication and errors in installation, the amount of crust in the pipeline, and the incoming air is mixed with Dust. Preventive steps to minimize damage to the gas engine are component adjustments, worker training, emphasis on SOPs, clearing checklists, component changes, and regular checks on radiator fluid properly.","sambudi hamali, danang prihandoko, shelvy kurniawan, kenny wijaya, rohmat hidayatulloh hazim habibi management department, binus business school undergraduate program, bina nusantara university, jl. k.h. syahdan no. 9, palmerah, jakarta 11480, indonesia sambudi_hamali@binus.ac.id, dprihandoko@binus.ac.id, shelvy.kurniawan001@binus.ac.id, kenny.widarsun@gmail.com, hazimhabibi@ymail.com",
179,Design And Evaluate A Process For Teaching Engineering  Students About Heuristic Decisions And Cognitive Biases,"in order to deal with challenges in daily activities and working hours, engineers need to be able to make decisions. project failure, late work, and missed chances can all stem from bad decisions. some of the many elements that influence decision-making and lead to choice errors include heuristic decisions and cognitive biases. these biases can be mitigated by providing decision-makers with greater information about them through training and education. as a result, educational institutions are a valuable resource in the development of good decision-making abilities. the next step in this research is to offer a method for teaching engineering students about heuristic judgments and cognitive biases in the classroom, using a lecture and a final project. the method was created with the idea of student-centered learning in mind. a pre-survey, a post-survey, and a final survey were created to assess the improvement in decision- making during the process. because they had more knowledge and could understand the influence of cognitive biases in decision-making, the results demonstrated that the knowledge transfer process could help decision-makers to make better decisions. furthermore, several of them were inspired to dig deeper into issues and develop strategies for dealing with them.","decision-making, de-biasing, transfer knowledge",,"narucha tanaiutchawoot full lecturer professor of industrial engineering faculty of engineering suranaree university of technology nakornradchasrima, thailand narucha@g.sut.ac.th","References

180,Analyzing The Impact Of Digital Payment On Efficiency And  Productivity Of Commercial Banks – A Case Study In China,"digital payment has become one of the most popular payment methods all around the world, especially in countries that witnessed the rapid development of internet. as a traditional financial institution, commercial banks have been impacted by newly developed payment technology since third payment platforms have attracted customers to use the digital payment for daily consumption, transferring, and even investment. this paper focuses on analyzing whether and how the commercial banks in china have been affected by digital payment by using empirical methods. systematic generalized method of moments (sys-gmm) is used to test the relationship between the productivity of commercial banks and digital payment. panel vector auto-regression (panel var) is then applied to evaluate the long-term impact of the growth in digital payment on the efficiency of commercial banks, which is calculated by the malmquist productivity index (mpi). the result based on data from 81 banks in china between 2013-2019 suggests that bank- involved digital payment is beneficial to both profitability and productivity of commercial banks, and third-party digital payment harms the profitability but is not a granger cause of productivity.","digital payment, commercial banks","The impact of digital payment on traditional commercial banks has been proved by using empirical methods, and the results of the empirical analysis indicate the hypothesis as well as demonstrate that the impact of digital payment on commercial banks can be analyzed by profitability as well as productivity. However, the impact cannot be concluded as simply positive or negative. According to the type of digital payment platforms, bank-involved digital payment and third-party digital payment have different effects on commercial banks. The development of digital payment poses opportunities as well as risks for traditional commercial banks. If commercial banks realize the benefits brought by the change in payment system, traditional banks can collaborate with digital payment and increase their profitability and efficiency. However, there are potential risks caused by the fierce competition with newly developed technology. To collaborate with digital payment, traditional commercial banks should employ and embrace new technology which can help them reduce cost, increase efficiency, and control risks (Dong et al. 2020). In addition to the benefits of technology upgrades, the information from digital payment and users of digital payment platforms can be shared with commercial banks since bank-involved digital payment requires a bank account. As a result, commercial banks can complement their shortcomings. Currently, the rapid growth in e-Commerce promotes the development of digital payment. Large digital payment platforms, such as Alipay and WeChat Pay, have a strong customer base and advanced technology, such as biological recognition, to ensure security. Collaborating with such companies can help the reformation within traditional commercial banks. On the other hand, those digital payment platforms which don’t need bank participation bring more challenges for commercial banks by providing higher interest rates of deposits and lower interest rates for loans. As a result, competition leads to a loss in customers of commercial banks due to attractive interest rates and better services provided by third-party digital payment platforms. To be better prepared for such challenges posed by third-party digital payment platforms, commercial banks should improve their competitiveness to maintain their customers by providing better services and more attractive interest rates. In conclusion, according to the results of these empirical methods, traditional commercial banks should be open to new technology and keep improving competitiveness under the current situation that digital payment is becoming more and more popular. More than that, traditional commercial banks must play their strengths. For example, commercial banks are more trustworthy compared to internet finance companies. In this way, commercial banks can increase their profitability and be more efficient.

182,The Role Of Customer Value Co-Creation Behavior In  Business Management,"this research aims to explore the role of customer value co-creation behavior concerning innovativeness and customer engagement in the business of the automotive industry. this research is a study with a quantitative approach. the sampling technique used is the accidental sampling technique. the data analysis technique used is structure equation modelling using smart pls. the result was showing that customer value co-creation affects the automotive industry, especially when influenced by innovativeness and customer engagement variables. customer engagement is shown not to mediate the relationship between innovativeness and customer participation behavior. customer engagement is shown to significantly mediate the relationship between innovativeness and customer citizenship behavior","innovativeness, turkey","Research on customer value co-creation behavior conducted in the automotive industry as a service provider plays an important role for automotive industry players. Customer value creation is divided into two variables, namely customer participation behavior and customer citizenship behavior. Factors that affect customer value co-creation are innovativeness and customer engagement. From the results of the study, data found that these two variables affect customer participation behavior, although not significantly. Customers do not mind sharing known information about the automotive world with operators at automotive dealers, but that does not mean customers are immediately willing to work with the operator to try something new on the vehicle as directed by the operator. The role of customer citizenship behavior is greater than the role of customer participation behavior in the automotive world. Customers in the automotive industry are easier to provide advice in terms of work or information about Auto 2000 to operators, other customers, or non-Auto2000 customers. Thus customer value co-creation still plays an important role for Auto2000 to create new value in the relationship between the company and the customer. In this case, it is recommended that the company still involve customers in customer value co-creation. Innovativeness and Customer Value Co-Creation behavior have a positive relationship in the automotive industry. This is possible because customers are very fond of innovations related to the automotive world, especially technology-based innovations in their vehicles. This can be a valuable input so that automotive companies keep the company's technological progress in creating innovations for automotive products. Customer engagement indirectly does not mediate the relationship between innovativeness and customer value co-creation in customer participation behavior variables. However, customer engagement indirectly affects the variables of customer citizenship behavior. Furthermore, to develop research on customer value co-creation behavior variables in other manufacturing industries that have never been studied using these variables.","tiurida lily anita faculty of economy and communication hotel management department bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia tiurida.anita@binus.ac.id tujuh martogi siahaan faculty of economy & business service management trisakti university jakarta, indonesia berdikari35@gmail.com asep suparman faculty of business and management department of sea transportation trisakti institute of transportation and logistic jakarta, indonesia suparman1501@gmail.com hermanto yaputra faculty of economy & business magister management trisakti university jakarta, indonesia hermanto.yaputra@trisakti.ac.id",
183,"Distributed Manufacturing And Supply Chains, Applying  Multi-Attribute Decision Supporting System","distributed manufacturing (dm) is a crucial interest area of operations management. that interest is rising since dm supports achieving sustainability goals, can mitigate risks of the global supply chains, and strengthen local economies. some of these advantages and disadvantages of dm analysed earlier mainly focused on the operations. still, there are many additional advantages across the supply chains, from local sourcing to serving the end-users and handling reverse supply chain challenges. while the economy of scale is essential in reducing costs and improving productivity, highly centralised manufacturing increases transportation costs and make operations more vulnerable and lead to supply chain disruptions by causing a ripple effect. it is a fundamental issue during the covid-19 pandemic when government impose strict restriction on transportation. the lack of understanding of trade-offs and proper comparison of the effects could hinder the further development of dm. increasing the confidence and reducing risks by a fair and comprehensive analysis is critical for early adopters of dm and could be the key to increased implementation. this study introduces a multi-attribute decision support system (madss) and an assessment process to consider the impacts across the supply chains and guide stakeholders, academics, and decision-makers. multi-attribute decision supporting systems need to handle qualitative and quantitative information, missing data, and uncertainty. a team of experts from the academy and the industry - coordinated by the authors - developed an indicator framework and evaluation process to fit dm and construction decision support but could be applied later in other sectors and regions. the developed madss was used to analyse distributed manufacturing and traditional construction alternatives from economic, social, environmental, and resilience perspectives in new zealand to demonstrate applicability. the critical research contributions are: proceedings of the international conference on industrial engineering and operations management istanbul, turkey, march 7-10, 2022 ieom society international 1685",,"While DM has practised for centuries, automatisation, globalisation, new technologies, and the need for resilient and sustainable supply chains provide new opportunities. At an early stage, applying a Multi-Attribute Decision Supporting System is helpful to explore the feasibility and discuss the operation model with stakeholders. We found that the key advantages are: • Can be used in case of incomplete or lack of quantitative data • Based on experts’ opinions, group decision • Support stakeholders’ discussions • Decisions based on predefined decision functions The analysed construction case studies indicate that DM is advantageous from sustainability.

Although there have been a few studies in the last two years on the economic impact of COVID-19, we emphasize the significance of the loss of tribal knowledge due to the workforce disruption, and the importance of preserving such knowledge for training new employees to maintain productivity. Many factors, which include but are not limited to supply chain issues, labor shortage, government’s COVID-19 relief programs, contribute to the rising production and consumer costs. The pandemic has challenged both scholars and industry to revisit many decade-long operations management practices and production strategies, and to propose new ideas to balance efficiency and flexibility, not just at the individual business level but also national level, in a global economy. It seems vaccines and boosters combined with vaccine mandates will help navigate through this pandemic.","sheikh f. ferdous and m. affan badar department of applied engineering and technology management indiana state university terre haute, indiana 47809, usa m.affan.badar@indstate.edu, sheikh.ferdous@indstate.edu yuetong lin department of engineering and technology embry-riddle aeronautical university – worldwide daytona beach, fl 32114, usa yuetong.lin@erau.edu",

188,"Third-Party Online Food Delivery Vs Silo Fast-Food  Restaurant Application, Which One Will Sustain In Greater","online food delivery has been growing rapidly in greater jakarta which is the most populous metropolitan area in indonesia. the rapid growth has opened lots of opportunities for businesses to join in the market. various types of online food delivery such as third-party online food delivery applications and silo fast-food restaurant applications have been emerging at the speed of light in the area. the competition between each business has been very intense that makes us wonder which type of application will sustain in the future. we have performed survey-based research to capture the preferences of the users specified on the university students as the potential target who use online food delivery service the most. the result of this research shows that the sustainability of online food delivery relies on its competitive advantages in terms of pricing, timesaving, and practicality.","sustainability, university student","and Limitation Based on the survey’s result, the third-party online food delivery application is more preferred compared to the silo fast food restaurants application. This is because university students prioritized promotion and price, and they also prefer to have an all-in-one application where they can order various menus from multiple restaurants. On the other hand, for the university students who often order from a specific restaurant only, they prefer to use the silo fast food restaurants application. For the silo fast-food restaurant application to sustain, they should offer more interesting promotion and focus on their loyal customers to keep ordering from them. Based on table 1, silo fast-food restaurant application is not as stable in terms of features compared to the third-party application since silo application is not focused on the application. But our data also show based on figure 3, that university students prioritize the price more than the feature. This means silo fast-food restaurant application still can compete as long as they can provide competitive advantage in terms of pricing. However, if the third-party application no longer can provide a competitive price, the users might also no longer use it and turns to the silo application. So, in order to sustain, both application needs to focus on giving a good price, practicality, and a good user experience for timesaving based on figure 1. To have a good user experience, silo application needs to be maintained regularly by having its own IT team or contract a trust-able vendor. When developing a new application, silo application the strategy needs to be evaluated first so the application will still be maintained when using a third-party vendor and not just a one-time contract. The limitations of this research are the location and generation. We conducted the survey in Greater Jakarta hence the result is exclusive in this area only. Different area segmentation might result different outcomes. This research is also limited to generations. Our respondents are restricted only to the university students born in 1995-2010. Different generations would produce different result and thus more research needs to be conducted.

However, this study finds that the attractiveness factor in the endorser credibility may not be significant in affecting the social media engagement behavior in the case of Indonesian sneaker footwear consumers that are members of Indonesian footwear brand endorsers’ Instagram community, But, two other dimensions of endorser credibility dimensions, i.e., the expertise and trustworthiness, may be significant and important to increase the consumer social media engagement behavior. Thus, local sneaker brands may focus on collaborating with local endorsers that have the expertise and trustworthiness about sneaker footwear to enhance consumer engagement (Jin and Ryu 2019). This study also shows evidence that social media engagement behavior may influence purchase intention in the case of Indonesia’s footwear brands. Thus, local sneaker brands may collaborate with the influencers and endorsers that have credibility about footwear and shoes to create social media posts that are beneficial and entertaining to boost the consumer social media engagement behaviors (Gummerus et al. 2012). For future research we suggest researchers examine endorsers of global footwear brands to have a better understanding of the difference between endorsers of local footwear brands and endorsers of global footwear brands and how they may impact social media engagement and purchase intention of their social media members.","nisryna nabyla putri and tasya safira putri sadewo student of creative marketing program management department binus business school master program bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia 11480 nisryna.putri@binus.ac.id, tasya.sadewo@binus.ac.id artha sejati ananda assistant professor of creative marketing program management department binus business school master program bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia 11480 artha.ananda@binus.edu",

Based on the results of data processing obtained, it can be concluded that the action research that Sprinkdays conducted through social media marketing activities on its Instagram account did not show a significant increase in Sprindkays’ sales performance.There is no improvement in Sprinkdays sales performance because the social media marketing strategy has not been carried out intensively. It can be seen from the Sprinkdays content upload time frame, with an average content uploaded of only three content per month, the lack of audience participation in the interactive content that Sprinkdays uploaded, and the minimum number of customers who filled out the feedback form. Based on the questionnaire obtained, the biggest contribution to Sprinkdays’ sales performance from social media marketing is customer relationships related to Sprinkdays friendliness in responding to customers.

196,Business Performance Management For Smes: Countryspecific Differences In Performance Drivers Lead To Different,"business performance management systems support companies in achieving their objectives and improving their performance. the content of the paper is based on surveys conducted as part of an international research project. the survey focuses on assessing the impact of external and internal factors on business performance. the results show that there are country-specific differences in terms of influencing factors. while there are many regional similarities in the internal influencing factors, the external influencing factors in particular diverge. the practical implications of the studies show which internal and external factors smes should focus on to improve their business performance. the results of the study can be used to develop business performance management systems tailored to smes.",,"The studies conducted in this research project as well as studies from the literature review show that there is still a need for research on SMEs and the topic of business performance management, both in science and in practice. The findings of these regional studies show differences here in that the companies in the two regions assess the influence of the various factors on company performance differently. It follows that performance measurement and management systems must also take these region-specific characteristics into account. The development of a management system must therefore be very specific to the needs of the SME. The practical implications of the studies indicate which internal and external factors SMEs should focus on in order to increase business performance. In particular, the external factors could have an influence on the company's performance. Here, it is important to consider which KPIs should be used to map the external factors. In the course of the interviews, it was also found that small companies in particular do not see the need for a formal BPM. Decisions tend to be made intuitively. One assumption for this attitude is that the introduction of a BPM is not required by law and therefore anything that does not serve the immediate core business is not implemented. A theoretical limitation is the generalisability of the results due to the small sample in both regions. Furthermore, individual regions of both countries were selected. It turned out that the impact of the factors on company performance is assessed differently by the companies in the two regions. Generalisability can therefore only be limited from this point of view. A further limitation is that there is a wide spread of different constellations within SMEs and therefore different approaches to BPM can also exist in these. Possible differentiations result, for example, from the range of products and services, the number of employees, the level of sales or the competitive situation. In this respect, too, it is necessary to take a closer look at the SMEs and thus to narrow down the subject area.

201,Mental Workload Assessment And Neuroergonomics  Approach Of Private Car Drivers Passing Along The Epifanio,"research has shown that driving is a task that demands high cognitive resources for drivers to manage visual and auditory functions, execute decision-making actions, and perform manual operations to achieve their motivation in traveling from and to different locations. this can influence the mental workload of the drivers. this study aims to assess the mental workload of private car drivers passing along epifanio de los santos avenue (edsa) and the factors that influence their driving performance. based on the subjective mental workload assessment tool, nasa task load index (nasa-tlx), an online survey was randomly distributed among private motorists driving in edsa. the responses were assessed to obtain the mental workload scores. further analysis of the responses shows the significant factors of the drivers’ mental workload through the use of student’s t-test, pearson correlation, and simple linear regression, and the contribution of the neuroergonomics approach. the results indicate that private car drivers in edsa experience an overall high mental workload in performing their driving tasks in relation to the factors that significantly impact their performance. on this basis, it is recommended that the mental workload of private car drivers is seen as a key factor in edsa’s traffic congestion and accident-prone nature. proceedings of the international conference on industrial engineering and operations management istanbul, turkey, march 7-10, 2022 ieom society international 1858",,,"de los santos avenue (edsa) ma. isabelle j. delos santos researcher industrial engineering department, adamson university ma.isadelossantos@gmail.com regille kyle c.villareal researcher industrial engineering department, adamson university regille.villareal@gmail.com sheily mendoza, pie, asean eng. research co-adviser adamson university sheily.mendoza@adamson.edu.ph dr. venusmar c. quevedo, pie, asean eng. research adviser vice president for administration adamson university vcquevedo@gmail.com",
202,Improving Stock Market Intraday Prediction By Generative  Adversarial Neural Networks,"in this study, we introduce a novel framework for enhancing intraday stock price forecasting by leveraging synthetic data to train a predictive model. recognizing the inherent challenges of short- term stock market predictions due to their volatile and noisy nature, we propose a solution that employs a conditional wasserstein generative adversarial network with gradient penalty (wgan-gp) and a mode-normalization procedure to generate highly realistic synthetic data. the synthetic data, which closely mirrors real stock price data, is used to enrich the training dataset, providing the forecasting model with a broader range of examples to learn from. for the forecasting task, we utilize a long short-term memory (lstm) network, a type of recurrent neural network renowned for its ability to model sequential data and learn long-term dependencies, making it particularly suited for intraday stock forecasting. our framework employs a wgan-gp, a variant of the traditional gan architecture, known for its stability and ease of training. the wgan-gp uses a wasserstein loss function, a robust measure of distance between two distributions, and a gradient penalty term to prevent overfitting of the discriminator to the training data. to further enhance the stability of our gans, we incorporate a technique known as mode normalization. this process normalizes the activations of the generator network to ensure a constant mean and variance, preventing the generation of unrealistic samples. we evaluate our proposed framework using both quantitative and qualitative criteria. that includes : distributions similarity, distributional metric, ablation study, temporal autocorrelation and, predictive score. 1876",,,"badre labiad amips research team ecole mohammadia d’ingénieurs, mohammed v university in rabat, morocco labiad.badre@gmail.com abdelaziz berrado amips research team ecole mohammadia d’ingénieurs, mohammed v university in rabat, morocco berrado@emi.ac.ma loubna benabbou département sciences de la gestion universit du québec rimouski (uqar) campus de lévis québec canada loubna_benabbou@uqar.ca",
203,Evaluating The Accuracy Of Lstm Forecasting Model And  Intervention Programs In Combating Covid-19,"this paper extends the research on the accuracy of long short term memory (lstm) deep learning model to forecast covid-19 daily cases in the philippines with features affecting the transmission of virus. the study utilized a mixed method; qualitative research to analyze and understand experiences to generate ideas and quantitative research to gather measurable data that will be used for statistical analysis. the study examined three factors affecting the forecasting of covid-19. the modeling procedure was completed using python 3.0. the research results indicate that the forecasting of covid-19 daily cases using the lstm forecasting model has an error of no more than 17% error which depicts as an acceptable accuracy. it also specifies that the model shows more meaningful trends in the two (2) week forecast rather than the two (2) month forecast. the study triangulated the trends of forecast with the help of focus group discussion with health experts and health administrative personnel. the results specify that 75 percent wear the necessary ppes when going out and 60 percent always keep physical distance. using the lstm deep learning model, the study provides a framework that helps understand the behavior of the virus and forecast covid-19 cases months ahead. proceedings of the international conference on industrial engineering and operations management istanbul, turkey, march 7-10, 2022 ieom society international 1887",,,"pauline kay s. de guzman researcher industrial engineering department, adamson university pauline.kay.de.guzman@adamson.edu.ph addie rafaella p. honolario researcher industrial engineering department, adamson university addie.rafaella.honolario@adamson.edu.ph nestley i. sore, pie, asean eng. research co-adviser director, office of program and standard adamson university nestley.sore@adamson.edu.ph dr. venusmar c. quevedo, pie, asean eng. research adviser vice president for administration adamson university vcquevedo@gmail.com","References

204,Cross-Sectional Dependency And Panel Unit Root Tests:  Foreign Direct Investment In Indonesia,"indonesia has a unique characteristic, namely a large area separated by islands and diverse people in culture and religion and abundant economic resources. indonesian president joko widodo faces various domestic political opponents and foreign interests over indonesian resources. since the export of mining raw materials is prohibited, foreign investors must invest directly in indonesia. therefore, attracting foreign investment to manage natural resources is very important. this paper wants to explain the problem of econometrics, namely stationarity in indonesia's foreign direct investment panel data. the panel unit root test can be carried out in various ways: the levin-lin-chu test, harris-tzavailis test, breitung, im-pesaran-shim test, fisher type test, and hadri lm stationary. the software of data processing is stata release 15. we use panel data covering all 34 provinces and 12 periods from 2009 to 2020. the result of this research is that foreign direct investment data is stationary and can be used to need econometric items. thus, indonesia's panel data for foreign direct investment is robust.","panel data, cross-sectional, panel unit root","The unit root and static tests in table 1 Levin-Lin-Chu Unit Root Test, table 2 Harris-Tzavalis Unit Root Test and table 3 Hadri LM Test show the same among them. Foreign Direct Investment data is stationary. if FDI data is flat, stationary does not contain a trend component, has a constant variance, and has no periodic fluctuations. Thus, FDI data can be processed through regression with other independent variables that are also stationary. The results of the parameter coefficients of each independent variable explain the influence between variables, not a false statement. By doing regression testing through various model approaches, we will get robust parameter coefficients (Sidik Budiono, Purba, & Purba, 2021). In other words, the coefficients are truly best linear unbiased (BLUE) in the econometric equation.","sidik budiono department of management faculty of economics and business universitas pelita harapan, tangerang-15811, indonesia sidik.budiono@uph.edu john tampil purba department of management faculty of economics and business universitas pelita harapan, tangerang-15811, indonesia john.purba@uph.edu",
205,Employees’ Performance Of Production Division In A Textile  Firm In Indonesia,"this study aims to describe the effect of work motivation, competence, and job satisfaction partially and simultaneously on the performance of employees of pt semesta alam*) in the production department. the method used is a quantitative method, with a population of 400 respondents, using the slovin formula with an error rate of 5%, obtained a sample of 200 respondents. sem (structural equational modeling) on students lisrel 9.1 was used for data analysis. the data analysis technique of this study employs descriptive statistics. based on the results of the normality test, it is found that the skewness value is less than 2, and the kurtosis value is less than 7. thus, these results indicate that these values are normally distributed. in addition, the p-value of skewness and kurtosis is above 0.05. the results showed that, first, there was an effect of work motivation on job satisfaction with a coefficient of 0.34. second, the influence of employee competence on job satisfaction with a coefficient of 0.35. third, there is an effect of work motivation on employee performance with a coefficient of 0.09. fourth, there is an influence of employee competence on employee performance with a coefficient of 0.26. fifth, there is an effect of job satisfaction on employee performance with a coefficient of 0.53. in addition, work motivation and employee competence can explain job satisfaction with a determination value of 0.28. finally, work motivation, employee competence, and job satisfaction can explain employee performance with a determination value of 0.45.","work motivation, job satisfaction","5.1. The effect of work motivation on job satisfaction Motivation positively affects job satisfaction with the coefficient value of 0.34 and the t-calculated value of 4.46. This result is realized by the management since work motivation, such as job promotion, has been the parameter in improving job satisfaction. Job promotion is the goal of every employee. In addition to job promotion, bonuses and life insurance also affect job satisfaction. Employees will be satisfied if the company provides their physical needs, appreciation, and safety. Those factors, therefore, need to be paid attention to by the company. 5.2. The effect of competence on job satisfaction Competence has a positive effect on job satisfaction with the coefficient value of 0.35 and the t-calculated value of 4.64. The management realizes this result because employee competence is the result of training and education as well as working experience supporting employees’ competence. Training enhances the skills of employees needed in their work. Thus, the company needs to provide equal opportunities to its employees to attend training. 5.3. The effect of work motivation on employee performance Motivation has a positive influence on employee performance with a coefficient value of 0.09 and the t-calculated value of 2.07. The management realizes this result because so far, the motivation provided to the employees was minimum. Seeing this fact, the company must increase the motivation of employees by first maintaining the relationship and communication, especially between leaders or superordinates with employees or subordinates. This action is expected will increase the motivation of employees and finally increase their work performance. The motivation of employees is also supported by bonuses, job promotions, and guarantee or safety aspects at work. 5.4. The effect of competence on employee performance Competence positively affects employee performance with a coefficient value of 0.26 and the t-calculated value of 6.27. The management realizes this result since the employees with more working experience have a higher performance. Thus, it is necessary to increase the performance of the employees who have minimum experience by, for instance, conducting skill training. 5.5.The effect of job satisfaction on employee performance The job satisfaction positively affects employee performance with the coefficient value of 0.53 and the t-calculated value of 8.17. This result is considered a sensible result by the management. The most dominant factor which affects employee performance is opportunities to attain carrier achievement. In addition to the chances of getting achievement at work, a good and harmonious relationship among employees also contributes to job satisfaction. Another factor that may affect is the fair treatment from the superordinates to the subordinates or employees. 5.6. The effect of work motivation on employee performance through job satisfaction Work motivation has a positive effect on employee performance through job satisfaction with the coefficient value of 0.259. It means that happy employees, while doing their work or afterward, will be motivated to make the extra effort and have a better performance.

207,Combining Customer And Sustainability Requirements   In Quality Function Deployment For A Composite Aircraft,"today, companies that produce economically, taking into account the social and environmental effects of production processes, as well as meeting customer needs, are more successful. quality function deployment (qfd) is a methodology that listens and analyzes customer voices then transforms them to engineering characteristics. in this study, an extended qfd is proposed by considering not only customer needs but also sustainability requirements. while defining the priorities of all requirements, analytic hierarchy process (ahp) is used. the proposed approach is applied for a composite horizontal stabilizer. the horizontal stabilizer is a fixed aircraft wing section that is used to maintain the aircraft in longitudinal balance, provide stability for the aircraft and keep it flying straight. it is a composite-based aircraft component. with the increasing popularity of composite materials for aircraft construction, it is crucial to make suitable product design for customer needs and sustainability requirements. the proposed methodology is appropriate for use in product design to handle customer needs and social, economic, environmental aspects of production together. in literature, integration sustainability with qfd is few studied. new discoveries of the proposed approach are illustrated in detail using a case study of a composite horizontal stabilizer that is used in a military aircraft.",product design,"There is a growing demand and interest in considering social and environmental effects of the products. Therefore, companies need to have a sustainable approach to determining which engineering characteristics are the most important while designing products. In this study, an extended QFD with sustainability is proposed by combining customer needs and sustainability requirements to achieve long term competitiveness. Aircraft industry face more challenges to achieve sustainability in the product design phase while considering of having safety, reliability, environmental and cost requirements. For this reason, the proposed approach is applied for a composite horizontal stabilizer of an aircraft. In literature, studies mainly focus on environmental design aspect sustainability. In this study, combining customer needs and all aspects of sustainability has addressed in an integrated manner. In the future study, other charts will be employed in QFD. Also, a model using fuzzy numbers can be presented instead of crisp values.","structure sezen ayber ph.d. candidate of industrial engineering institute of graduate programs eskisehir technical university eskişehir, turkey sezen.dulger@gmail.com.tr nihal erginel professor of industrial engineering faculty of engineering eskisehir technical university eskişehir, turkey nerginel@eskisehir.edu.tr","references, Expert Systems with Applications, vol. 37, no. 3, pp. 2186–2196, 2010.

208,Towards A Basis For Policy Framework For Stockouts And  Shortages Of Drugs,"stockouts and shortages of essential medicines in hospitals and health facilities are severe and well-known public health issues worldwide, including in the philippines, with well-known adverse effects for morbidity, mortality, and disease epidemiology. this complicates medicine delivery for healthcare units and makes it challenging to get therapy when medications are unavailable, and no substitutes are supplied. the research was conducted in a tertiary government hospital in the philippines. respondents included in the survey are personnel involved in the pharmaceutical supply chain for three years. the study assessed the impact of medicine shortages and stockouts on a patient's healthcare and generated policy recommendations for the better supply chain management. the researcher used structured questionnaires for the survey to facilitate data gathering. the statistical analysis was used to develop a policy framework to address the issues. results showed that changes in the procurement and inventory practices in the hospital must be improved. the hospital is recommended to focus on training and capacity building on the pharmaceutical supply chain stakeholders, strengthen internal pharmacy strategies to make operations more efficient, engineering and administrative support, maximize information technology, maximize available funds, and enhance good governance.","drug stockouts, drug shortages, medicine stockouts, medicine shortages","Overall, the survey analysis revealed that medicine stockouts are widespread in the subject institution, with a mean of 3.75 and a standard deviation of 1.00. However, there is a medicine shortage in the hospital, with a mean rating of 3.70 and a standard deviation of.919. When medications are unavailable for an extended length of time, all respondents agreed that patients may develop drug resistance and treatment failure. This build has the highest mean rating of 4.50 and the smallest standard deviation of.682. In conclusion, the subject hospital, as a 500-bed, level 3 teaching-training, and tertiary government hospital, aims to provide patients with a continuous supply of high quality, safe, and effective drugs and medicines at least 90% of the time. Gaps in the current system have been identified, and solutions have been proposed. Hopefully, these would result in achieving the target, or even exceeding it, with the provision of 100% of drugs and medicines to all patients, helping in achieving the goals of the Department of Health of better health outcomes, financial risk protection, and a more responsive health system for all Filipinos. Acknowledgments I would like to thank Dr. Rodante A. Roldan for his insightful contribution to this study, my classmate, Engr. Jocelyn D. Abad for guiding and encouraging me to publish my dissertation and to my family and friends for their unending support.

209,The Affect Of Digital Transformation On Leadership In  Shariah Bank: A Literature Review,"in this paper, the literature on digital transformation and leadership in shariah bank was surveyed. the aim derived from doing the relevant literature review is to develop a research model to guide empirical studies. shariah bank has comparative advantages compared to the conventional bank which is presented by the unique product, different structure, and different concept. shariah bank has unique products such as products without riba which is defined as interest, investment prohibits goods or services that are contrary to shariah laws. the financial transaction in shariah bank demand that risk must be shared. the symmetrical risk and return distribution on participants must be applied. all activities in shariah bank must be monitored and advised by a board of shariah experts to ensure shariah bank activities are in line with shariah laws. eventhough have comparative advantages, in reality, shariah bank can not be a leader in the banking market compared to conventional bank. in terms of total assets, market share, literacy, and inclusion index, shariah bank still left behind the conventional bank. in the digital area, eventhough shariah banks already have digital banks but overall in the competition of digital banks, the conventional bank still stays ahead compared to shariah banks. this study describes and analyzes this phenomenon from the source factor of competitive advantage of shariah bank which are digital transformation and leadership. the phenomenon of leadership in shariah bank can be shown through the composition of the board of directors in shariah bank. most shariah bank bod is from the conventional bank which impacted the decision or business strategy of shariah bank. to investigate these phenomena, this study collects and analyzes the issues from literature (research journal, models, concept, and theory). the result of this literature review demonstrates a significant relationship between digital transformation and leadership as the source of competitive advantage in shariah bank. as for originality this paper as the best of authors’ knowledge that the study on digital transformation in shariah bank is limited.","leadership, shariah bank","This study has reviewed the last ten years' research about digital transformation and leadership. From the systematic literature review, we identify how far leadership has a relationship and impact on the digital transformation process. Specifically, we have proposed a theoretical model in the scope and conceptualization by presenting dimensions for each variable (digital transformation and leadership) Due to the amount of literature that we found and examined, This study examines how firms organize and manage their digital transformation through a multiple-case study. . The findings offer insight on the most significant social components in terms of leadership play a crucial role in incumbent firms' digital transition. The findings shed more light on how each identified social factor contributes to the achievement of performance outcomes for effective digital transformation. In the end, this research presents a comprehensive framework to start digital transformation journeys. It is also worth noting that this study has limitations. The study only analyzes one variable that impacts to digital transformation process which needs more empirical studies to get a better result. An additional interview is also suggested for future research. Furthermore, we call for further studies to investigate other variables such as culture, structure, combined with leadership, and customer experience.","nila astiti department of management faculty of economics and business padjajaran university bandung, indonesia nila20004@mail.unpad.ac.id yudi ahmad faisal department of management faculty of economics and business padjajaran university bandung, indonesia yudi.ahmad@unpad.ac.id",
210,Analyzing The Relationship Between Equipment Operation  Time Toward The Queueing Problem Of The Head Truck,"indonesia is one of the archipelago countries that has around 62% water area. to maximize the utilization of this condition, there are many freight and cargo shipping company that can be found in indonesia. this paper is focusing on the stevedoring activity in the container yard. during the observation, researcher found a problem that is during the loading and unloading the container, the truck must wait in a long queue. it causes the stevedoring activity require a longer time to be completed. the goal of this paper is to find out the relationship between the operation time of each type of equipment in the container yard and the queueing problem of the head truck during loading and unloading activity. the method used in this paper is multiple linear regression with the combination of some tools in quality control. after one month collecting the data, the researcher come up with regression equation to understand the relationship between the equipment operation time and the queueing problem.",control chart,"Based on the data analysis and findings, below is the conclusion that can be derived from this paper: 1. From the control chart constructed from the data of TRT, Haulage, LOLO RTG, and LOLO CC, it can be said that some data exceed the upper control limit (UCL). Since the data used is the time needed by the equipment to complete the task, when there is data that exceeds the UCL, it means the related equipment needs a longer time to do the activity. Exceeding a control limit can also be concluded that there is a problem that happens during the operations. 2. The fishbone diagram shows that there are two types of causes which are internal and external. The internal cause is from the operator skill, maintenance, and container placement. The external cause is the traffic jam. 3. The linear regression equation said that the CC & HMC has a positive significant influence on productivity. From the equation, it can be concluded that every increase of the CC & HMC will contribute to productivity by 0.314. 4. The Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) table shows that the variable that has the most significant impact in the model is the Head Truck because the P-value of this variable is less than 0.05. 5. Based on the value in the model summary, the model used in this paper is not the best one. It is because the correlation between the operation time spent by the equipment with the productivity is only 16%. The determination coefficient also only 6.09%, which means that there are 93.91% of factors of productivity have not covered in this paper yet. By that, it can be concluded that the equipment operation time only contributes around 6.09% to the queueing problem that happens in the container yard.

213,Usability Evaluation And User Acceptance Of Cobot:  Case Study Of Universal Robots Cb Series.,"cobots have been increasing its importance due to the new stage in the development of industrial robots, in which humans and robots will collaboratively operate tasks whenever and wherever possible. by integrating cobot to coworking with humans, it can increase the competitive advantages to the industry in term of flexibility, quality, and productivity. however, the quality of its interface plays crucial role since it requires more interactions between operator and cobot in completing the working tasks. thus, the purpose of present study is to evaluate the usability of cobot's user interface and user acceptance of cobot, universal robots cb series. twenty senior undergraduate students in industrial engineering participated in this study. these experiments were remote moderated experiment. all participants were trained by using original training materials (training vdo) of universal robots cb series before start using cobot in experiment. testing task was to move box from point a to point b which is the basic task of cobot, this follows the vdo training instruction. during the experiment, occurred errors were counted (repeat count). after the testing task, participants were asked to evaluate the cobot’s program interface using sus questionnaire and user acceptance using tam questionnaire. results showed that only 10% of participants could successfully perform testing task using cobot interface. major error found during participants worked with testing tasks were that participants created irrelevant commands. participant’s attitude toward cobot remained positive. implication and suggestion are discussed.",universal robot,"This study aims to evaluate the usability of cobot's user interface and user acceptance using case study of universal robots CB series. Participants were asked to perform task of controlling the cobot to pick and place after learning the original e-learning VDO. The results revealed some issues in interface design that caused very low success rate from participants. This indicated that the interface was not well-designed enough for those who are non-expert in robotics and programming or operators. From the results of error analysis and user interview suggested that the structure or layout of the interface should be simplify in term of clear visual edge and be able to provide feedback for user so that they could recognize if there were any incorrect settings they have been made. Moreover, the terminology used for menu function should be user’s language and not ambiguous. The errors reported in present study should be further investigated in detail. Cobot software designer may consider using usability iterative design process to get insight to the quality of the interface design for specific target user. Additionally, SUS scores showed the result in the D grade of standard SUS usability. This reflected how participants perceived the usability performance of the system. The results from this study could be initially used to improve cobots’ user interface and raised the need to concentrate on the quality of the technology interface. The creation of user interfaces are as equally as crucial to the improvement of safety and process of effectively organizing resources and labor (Aaltonen and Salmi 2019). Furthermore, it may influence to the adoption rate of user that is critical for the introductory phase of the technology. On the same direction, user acceptance was accessed by using TAM questionnaire (Davis et al. 1989). Even though the overall attitude toward using was in the positive tone, the average rating scores of users’ perceived ease of use was still being concerned. Participants’ might have strong perceived usefulness from the technology of cobot, but the ease of use was a confirmed signaled that the usability issues of the interface were the barrier to adopt the cobot from user perspective. To support usability, the cobot’s user interface should be developed to be more intuitive or providing adequate guidance for using it by their target user. This will increase the likelihood of new technology adoption in industry. There were certain limitations to this study. Due to the severely spreading COVID-19 situation, so all experiments were remote moderated experiment.

214,Improving Of Financial Flexibility And Distress  On Consumer Goods Manufacturers In Indonesia,"this study aims to determine of financial flexibility and financial distress on consumer goods manufacturers in indonesia. this research used quantitative research that took data from the company's audited financial statement and proceeded with eviews 10. the population of this research is consumer goods manufacturers and used 8 samples that fulfilled certain criteria in 2017-2020 quarterly. this research used random effect model. the results reveal the values of adjusted r-squared of independent variables is 87.3184%, and 86.4835% simultaneously affecting financial flexibility and financial distress. return on asset is not significant in predicting financial flexibility and financial distress for selected samples. there are other four independent variables significantly influence financial flexibility and financial distress. the debt to equity ratio is the most influence variable on financial flexibility. the most influential variable on financial distress is market to book value. investors and consumer goods companies might utilize the implications of this outcome to evaluate the company's success. investors and consumer products makers might use the implication outcome to evaluate the company's performance.","financial distress, profitability",", the DER is the most significant variable in predicting FF. In Indonesia's consumer goods companies, the MBV ratio is the most significant variable of FD. In comparison to others with a value of 0.0000, the probability value is close to 0.0000. According to the positive coefficient of this ratio, a higher market-to-book value might be followed by increased FD. Therefore, the market-to-book value ratio is the most significant variable to consider in predicting FD. 5. Conclusion ROA has insignificant negative influence on FF. The company should be influenced by the magnitude of this value ratio. This shows that the company can generate profits compared to relatively high assets. The CR has a significant positive influence on FF. The high-value ratio shows that the higher the profit the company will achieve. The DER has a significant positive influence on FF. The health of a company can be seen from this ratio. This key ratio shows how the company's liability to make the financials looks good toward the company's FF in the future. MBV has a significant positive influence on FF.

215,Impact Of Technology Adoption In Forward Logistics: A  Quantitative Approach,"we are seeing our workplace digitally evolving with more and more processes now being completed using technology; this is all because of industry 4.0. industry 4.0 is all about connectivity, and it is an opportunity to revolutionize how the industry responds to societal requirements. the introduction of technology into the industry is evolving towards a sustainable digital supply chain in the face of increasing complexity. the benefits of industry 4.0 technologies in improving various supply chain performance measures have been well described theoretically and established in the existing literature. however, no integrated model compares available technological options in different supply chain stages and shows the impact in quantitative terms in cost, traceability, flexibility, agility, and other metrics. this study aims to quantify the benefits of implementing these technologies in the supply chain through multi-objective modelling. the objective of the study is to minimize the overall transportation cost function and carbon emissions due to transportation for minimal adverse effects on the environment. we begin by proposing a sustainable logistics model that considers various vehicle types such as autonomous and semi-autonomous vehicles and carbon emissions associated with product transportation. with the robust optimization approach, the methodology seeks to consider technological implementation at every stage of forward supply chain. we deploy our model to a sample toy dataset to analyze the administration of technology. findings suggest that industry 4.0 technology would be effective for supply chain performance parameters, resulting in sunless carbon discharge with a comparative increase in the operational cost.","sustainable, industry 4.0, optimization, supply chain","As the model shows with the toy dataset used to validate the linear program formulated, the transportation cost for autonomous vehicles is high as compared to normal vehicles which shows that the operational cost is high for AV which might be the case that it is not being utilized in such a high scale as normal vehicle and also the fixed cost associated with the vehicle is high which make its operations costly. But on the other hand, emissions rates of carbon discharge are low for autonomous vehicles in all the cases, it might be because of the technology used which reduces the fuel consumption optimizes the performance and increases the efficiency of the vehicle. Also, electric vehicle if used as autonomous vehicle will be the best suitable option for transportation having least adverse effect on environment. The main limitation of the model could be the dataset used, which is a toy dataset, since getting exact real-time data for the aspects we consider here, might not be possible because of the lack of total fourth industrial revolution in the industries. Because of it this model is only a representation and validation of the model constructed but will be applicable for all the industries in near future.","gourav tiwari and vijaya dixit operation management indian institute of management ranchi jharkhand, india gourav.tiwari20ph@iimranchi.ac.in, vijaya.dixit@iimranchi.ac.in",
216,"Comparative Study Of Manual Washing And Galangal  Machine Washing: A Case Study Of Uttaradit Province,","price fluctuation of agricultural products in thailand is caused by several factors such as market demands, economic downturns, increasing oil prices, and the covid-19 pandemic, which directly impacts employment and labor for galangal producers uttaradit. the high labor cost for washing galangal, rising shipping costs, and health problems faced by farmers from galangal washing led the research team to see the significance of these problems. consequently, the research team applied engineering knowledge to the design and construction of a galangal washing machine that is suitably sized for the farmers of nang phaya sub-district, uttaradit province, and to study the payback period for the galangal washing machine through comparison with current labor use to determine whether the device is suitable for investment and actual application. according to the findings, the galangal washing machine that replaces traditional washing with manual labor can reduce galangal production costs by 773.07 baht per day, with the payback period for the galangal washing machine at 88.04 days. furthermore, the galangal washing machine has an effective capability to support future galangal production growth of as much as 5,000 kilograms per day. with a payback period of only 3 months, this machine can enhance the agricultural production of galangal farmers to increase income while also improving occupational health.","payback period, social","and Future Work Currently, the agricultural area of Nang Phaya Sub-district, Uttaradit Province, is continuously increasing the cultivation and processing of galangal by up to 9,624 kilograms per week. This is in response to market demands in the industrial sector, which is interested in the galangal of Nang Phaya Sub-district for its large size, strong fragrance, and good flavors, and galangal farming has always been the primary occupation of the local people. Therefore, the design and construction of the galangal washing machine can enhance production potential. The study found that it can reduce the number of human resources involved in galangal washing from 4 to 2 persons, thereby saving 600 Baht in labor costs per day. In addition, the machine was able to shorten working duration from 8 to 4 hours and further reduce electricity consumption by 16.792 Baht per day and water consumption by 8.07 Baht per day, corresponding to average total production cost reduction in galangal washing by 773.07 Baht per day or 241,198 Baht per year. Moreover, the payback period is only 88.04 days. The galangal washing machine is capable of supporting over 3,600 kilograms per day of production, thereby providing an opportunity to expand production capabilities to compete in the national market while increasing the confidence of industrial factors that buy the products and increasing the income of local farmers as a result of lower production cost and growing galangal cultivation areas, which can lead to sustainability in the occupations of the local people. Because galangal-washing is an essential preliminary processing process, studies should be conducted into utilizing natural clean water from Nang Phaya streams in the washing process to cut production costs further. Moreover, other types of machinery should be designed to cut galangal production costs, such as galangal slicers, bakers, and powder makers, which will help enhance the value of Nang Phaya galangal produce, and studies should be conducted into the design of the experiment (Luangpaiboon et al. 2019; Aungkulanon et al. 2021) and supply chain system for further galangal production planning (Pramasari and Hariyati, 2018) and scheduling (Ruekkasaem et.al.2021).

220,Application Of Distribution Activity Planning With  Distribution Requirement Planning Method On Pump,"pt. xyz is a company engaged in oil and gas manufacturing. the products made are esp pumps or petroleum pumps. pt. xyz has not yet applied a special method of planning demand in each of its distribution areas. this company also does not have a distribution activity schedule for the products to be shipped. this condition results in companies experiencing problems meeting customer demands and incurring excess distribution costs because they do not have optimal distribution activities. therefore, the solution to this problem is to use the distribution requirement planning (drp) method. distribution requirements planning is a method used to determine every need in the distribution process. by applying this drp method, distribution costs can be reduced by idr 15.920.327 with a cost reduction percentage of 32.61%.","distribution areas, distribution costs","From the analysis conducted, it can be concluded that PT. XYZ produces ESP pumps with a make to order or pre- order production process depending on customer demand. PT. XYZ in collaboration with PT. Pertamina. The petroleum pump produced will be planted into the ground to extract petroleum. Products manufactured are made of stainless steel. Therefore, PT. XYZ makes various pump pressure variations and ensures good quality. In addition, the PPIC division of the company coordinates with the sales department to manage the fulfilment of consumer demands, coordinates with the production department to arrange production schedules, coordinates with the distribution department to manage distribution activities for ESP pump products. Based on the above, it can be concluded that the PPIC division must have good communication skills to coordinate the process well. PT. XYZ has three distribution areas: South Sumatra, East Java, and Central Java. This company has a sales system using tenders with various distribution areas. Therefore, the demand from each region varies according to customer needs. PT. XYZ does not have a method for planning distribution activity requests. Therefore, the total costs incurred by the company during 2020 for distribution costs were IDR 48.796.101.

224,Raw Material Warehouse Layout Design Using Class-Based  Storage Method With Promodel And Flexsim Simulation At,"pt. xyz is a company engaged in manufacturing that produces cargo boxes, flatbeds, and other types of equipment for transportation. warehouse pt. xyz uses a randomized storage policy. frequently pt. xyz was unable to reach its production capacity target because the workers were waiting to arrive at the materials. this material shortage occurs because the raw material warehouse is not optimally used, so there is little material storage space. the space for workers to walk becomes narrow because many raw materials are placed on the floor. finding raw materials is long because workers have to unload the boxes first due to random placement and there is no name on the box. the proposed layout uses the class-based storage method and is validated using promodel and flexsim. validation with promodel shows that the transfer time of raw materials is 6.33 minutes faster or more efficient in transferring raw materials increases by 16% from the initial layout. validation with flexsim shows that the total output increases by 202 units or 11.60%. the best-proposed layout results obtained with a total distance transfer of raw materials of 39698.39m or the efficiency of transfer raw materials increased by 38.34% and the total cost of material handling is more efficient by idr 63,052,221 or costs decreased by 29.08%.","layout design, promodel","The design of the proposed layout of the raw material warehouse using the class-based storage method obtained three proposed layout designs with the mileage, the shortest time, and the lowest material handling costs from the initial layout. The proposed layout three was chosen because it has a total distance of 39698.39 m of raw material movement. The efficiency of raw material movement increased by 38.34%, with material handling costs of IDR 63,052,221 or saving more by 29.08% from the initial layout. In the proposed layout, there is also an empty room so that if the company wants to order more material when there is an increase in demand for cargo boxes, then the ordered material can be stored in the warehouse.

Aggregate planning chosen uses mixed aggregate planning of shift and overtime because the costs incurred are the smallest compared to other aggregate plans, which are Rp 6,581,332,303. RCCP calculation is done using CPOF, BOLA, and RPA techniques; the result shows that the production capacity meets the demand for the master production schedule. The CRP calculation shows that the capacity/availability is greater than the needs. Therefore, PT. DSG can meet customer demand from April 2021 to March 2022 with the available resources. The lot-sizing technique chosen for the MRP calculation is the Wagner Within Algorithm (WWA) method with a savings of Rp 1,292,972 with a percentage of 22% compared to the company's current method. Distribution planning using DRP can save Rp 1,789,276 with a percentage of 52% compared to the method currently used by the company.

227,Production Layout Replanning Using Systematical Layout  Planning With Shared Storage Method Analysis And Flexsim,"pt. xyz is a small to medium business engaged in producing children's apparel that produces various product designs, such as jumpsuits, dresses, and clothes for children from 0-1 years old. pt. xyz still has problems in the production sector, such as the missed production process, the production layout, which is considered ineffective compared to production standards. the warehousing system is dangerous and takes massive time and energy. so the researchers conducted direct observations and implementations in the field using data obtained from operations such as the amount of production, flow, time, and the number of employees. the new layout is processed by using a systematic layout planning method. slp method calculation consists of from to chart (ftc), operation process chart (opc), routing sheet, multi-product process chart (mppc), activity relationship chart (arc), activity relationship diagram (ard), area allocation diagram(aad), and flow processes to design new layouts and use shared storage methods throughput, assignment, calculation of needs and space. after being processed, the results of the 2 alternative designs have effectiveness, distance, and shorter time than the initial layout. from the two alternatives, simulations were carried out using the flexsim application and compared the time and production throughput. alternative number one was chosen because the production throughput was 2 more pieces than alternative 2, with an increase of about 11.4% compared to the initial layout. the final step is implementing the final design that has been selected at the production site.","facility layout, shared storage, low prices","This research provides several alternative layout results with the calculation of shared storage and systematic layout planning. The result calculation obtained two alternative design layouts. The chosen design layout is obtained from the number of productions and better simulation results, The output obtained from layout 1 is 367 pieces, more than the result of design layout 2, which is 365 pieces. The average number of products in cutting, Kamp, and ironing machines shows higher results than the average production of alternative 2 which only shows high production in cutting and embroidery machines. The average production time in design layout 1 increased by 6.16% improvement. The simulation results show that Alternative 1 is 11.39% more productive than the initial layout. The results of the warehouse layout using the Shared Storage method.

228,Product Design And Experiment On  Espresso Machine Portafilter Using,"in the industrial era 4.0, it is easy for companies to meet consumer needs quickly. one of the industries affected is the food and beverage industry, especially the coffee industry. to produce espresso quickly, companies need a tool, namely an espresso machine. however, the capacity of the existing portafilter is not enough to produce large amounts of espresso. the solution to this problem is to increase the capacity of the existing portafilter. the design of this portafilter uses the vdi 2221 and reverse engineering methods. this research uses a 1:2 scale as a standard. the espresso obtained increases as the mass of the powder increases. as the capacity increases, the pressure needs to be increased. the resulting waiting time in making espresso is roughly the same between the two portafilters. however, the total output produced is more than the portafilter before modification.","portafilter, espresso machine","and Suggestions 6.1 Conclusion From the results of the research above, it can be concluded as follows: 1. From the questions of importance survey results, it can be concluded that each question of validity test results is valid. Through the reliability test, the confidence level of this survey is in the high category. 2. The selected design was modified by increasing the head and basket height by 10 mm. The total capacity increased by 10 grams. 3. From the results of the application of the VDI 2221 method, a portafilter design is obtained using aluminium and a wooden handle. This result was chosen because it has ingredients that are safe for making coffee, durable, and low prices. 4. By increasing the capacity of the portafilter, the espresso machine's pressure must be increased to obtain a balanced flow time. 5. By using a 1:2 scale as a standard, the espresso output increases due to the powder mass. 6. The resulting waiting time in making espresso is roughly the same between the two portafilters. However, the total output produced is more than the portafilter before being modified.

230,"Developing A Research Model For The Effects Of  Organizational Structure'S Agility, Team Autonomy, And","in a world where there is constant change and market pressure, organizations have to evolve towards agile structures in order to ensure continuous development and remain competitive in a complex environment. businesses have had to switch to a more flexible structure in order to get rid of inertia and increase efficiency. one of the most important elements of these flexible structures is self-organized teams consisting of interdisciplinary people with different functional expertise working for a common purpose. there is not much information and guidance in the literature on how to operate self-organization, how teams self-organize in practice, and how to measure agile project performance. on the other hand, it is observed that there are leaders who are not officially appointed but emerge informally in autonomous teams without leaders. studies reveal that these informal leaders have positive effects on performance. in this study, a research model was introduced that explores the effects of organizational flexibility, team autonomy, and emerging leadership characteristics of team members on agile project performance. the research model has four main constructs with an organizational flexibility construct with variables organizational structure, openness to change, people-focused, and organizational creativity; the team autonomy construct with variables role distribution in the team, constructive feedback, trust, collaboration, and assigned manager; the emerging leadership construct with variables humility, influence, creative thinking, and adaptability; and finally, the dependent variable the agile project performance construct with variables customer satisfaction, team perception, and triple constraint.",team autonomy,"In this study, a conceptual model has been discovered, including factors that influence agile project performance. Following this qualitative study, a quantitative study is targeted. Firstly, survey questions will be prepared for construct and variables in the model with focus group study again. On the scale generated from these questions, explanatory and confirmatory factor analysis and validity and reliability analysis will be conducted.

232,Development Of Traveling Friends Search Service Through  Mobile Application “Destinasi”,"traveling is a moving activity with the aim of recreation. the purposes of traveling are usually to relax, explore, discover or learn at someplace. a solo traveler is someone who enjoys traveling alone, while a group traveler is someone who travels together with other fellow travelers. when people want to travel together but do not have a partner to go to, a travel agency is often an option to get a traveling partner. for some people, a travel agency is inflexible, making the trip unenjoyable. moreover, the fees charged to agents and tour guides are not ideal for backpackers with a low budget. this research aims to develop an application-based traveling companion search service called ""destinasi"". the research method is carried out by distributing questionnaires to the traveler communities in indonesia using google forms to find out how the traveler's interest is in developing application-based services. all the responses will be contributed as the input for the application features. the results show that some of the essential application features for indonesian travelers are a tour guide, information on traveling places, sharing stories, ratings, selection of partners based on gender, chat, news, nature lovers, and mystical tours.","service development, traveling, traveling-buddy, mobile application","The conclusion obtained from this research are: 1. Tourism is a trip to individuals or groups for recreation from one place to another. The classifications of tourist attractions are ethnic tourism, culture tourism, recreation tourism, nature tourism, resort city tourism, and agro- tourism. 2. The needs found by most tourists when traveling are the need for a tour guide, clear directions, accommodation, transportation, internet connection, and others. 3. The complaints that most tourists find when traveling are difficulties finding places of worship, clean toilets, halal food, places to eat according to taste, and others. 4. The survey results show that tourists like to do solo traveling, mini-group traveling, and big-group traveling. From all the answers, 59.5% prefer mini-group travelers, 36.9% choose big group travelers (> 5 people), and only 3,6% like to do solo traveling. 5. The traveler community is very interested in a traveling companion search application. This is evidenced by a survey that has been conducted showing 82% of respondents agree with the idea of this project. 6. The features selected to be implemented in the Destinasi application based on the survey results are the tour guide feature, information on traveling places, share stories, ratings, selection of partners based on gender, chat, news, nature lovers, historical and mystical tours. However, one feature idea is not implemented because the respondents answered that they do not need it, namely the short trip feature.","tallita almira harvy, talitha manggiasih, and rienna oktarina industrial engineering department faculty of engineering binus university jakarta, indonesia tallita.harvy@binus.ac.id, talitha.manggiasih@binus.ac.id, rienna.oktarina@binus.ac.id",
233,Aufound: Retrieval Of Misplaced Personal Belongings Through  Mobile Application And Web-Based Management System,"individuals are always concerned when they lose their belongings and searching for the items is quite challenging and difficult, especially for the students. notices concerning missing items are often put on notice boards in each department, but due of the constant updating of notes on the board, it does not last long, leading them to disregard it. with the advanced technology, system about lost and found can help with these kinds of issues by tracking and managing its records. to gather the effectivity of the aufound system, students and admins were given a survey with the use of 7-point likert scale. following an analysis of the collected data and the survey results, it is concluded that the system will greatly benefit the locale by bringing awareness, give an accurate data and enhance the manual system.","lost and found, reporting, retrieval","Upon the analysis of the data gathered and the conducted survey, the researchers concluded that the system will greatly benefit the locale. Firstly, bringing awareness towards its students that the Angeles University Foundation does not only care about the intellectual knowledge, but also to deliver a perception that their belongings are also part on how the University care for its students, as mentioned earlier one of the primary features of the system is that connection and communication is made easier and faster with the help of cloud messaging notification. Secondly, it is beneficial to the admin since it allows them to get an accurate data more efficiently and effectively from the reported item; the proposed system works, mainly the student, will be the one to input the parameters in the end of the admin – this will be done with the help of the mobile application and the data will automatically record without the admin interfering. Lastly, the researchers were able to enhance the manual system that the client is currently utilizing. The manual system consists of logbook which is prone to error and confusion. With AUFound, the data are more secured simply because it delivers safe environment: tables are organized, items are categorized, search bar is present, and generated number of reports are shown.","designed for angeles university foundation erwin castro, kaila david, kim de silva, lester roxas college of computer studies angeles university foundation angeles city, pampanga, philippines castro.erwinjohn@auf.edu.ph, david.arizakaila@auf.edu.ph, desilva.kimbrian@auf.edu.ph, roxas.lester@auf.edu.ph, joyce macaspac faculty college of computer studies angeles university foundation angeles city, pampanga, philippines majoycevm@auf.edu.ph",

Warmigami offers fashion products in jackets that can be folded and turned into smaller bags. As a startup business in the fashion industry, Warmigami also exposes the impact of the changing situation due to Covid-19. Warmigami's primary target market stopped its activities, and the people's purchasing power weakened, so the company had difficulty selling its goods. This study aims to find the right business strategy to increase sales from Warmigami during the Covid 19 pandemic. This study uses a SWOT analysis tool to analyze the company's internal and external conditions. The analysis results are inputted into the TOWS matrix to facilitate strategy analysis. Researchers also use the Business Model Canvas to form a business model or framework for Warmigami. Based on the analysis results, it is proposed that the company maintains the old target market and targets the new target market, the sports enthusiasts. The company should build close relationships with consumers, provide after- sales service, and increase promotions on Instagram and the marketplace to enhance sales.

239,Electricity And Gas Potential Of Abattoir Waste,"slaughterhouse operations generate huge volumes of organic wastes which include dung, fats, blood, animal trimmings, urine, and paunch contents. slaughterhouse wastes should be carefully handled and processed because are a potential source of bacterial, prion, viral, and parasitic pathogens, that can infect humans and animals. disposal methods include composting, rendering, anaerobic digestion (ad), alkaline hydrolysis (ah), incineration and incineration. slaughterhouse waste especially that with high fat and protein of slaughterhouse is excellent substrate for anaerobic digestion processes that leads to both disposal, nutrient recycling, and in methane generation. slaughterhouse waste can pollute air, soil, and water if disposed of untreated or poorly managed. this study demonstrates the potential of abattoir waste in the energy transition to renewable energy and low carbon electricity. the performance of operating slaughterhouse was used as a basis feasibility assessment. the composition of slaughterhouse waste was presented, and production output estimated under current and optimal conditions. slaughterhouses can be meet their own internal energy use and export excess as biogas, biomethane or electricity. this will earn extra revenue, mitigate against greenhouse gas emissions by displacing fossil fuel sources and solve the challenge of waste treatment and disposal. key words anaerobic digestion; slaughterhouse; slaughterhouse waste; biogas production, biogas from slaughterhouse waste. 1.0. introduction abattoirs or slaughterhouses produce significant quantities of biodegradable organic wastes such mainly in form of blood, fat, feaces, fat, blood, animal trimmings, paunch contents and urine. slaughterhouse waste can be disposal of by composting, alkaline hydrolysis (ah), rendering, anaerobic digestion (ad), rendering, incineration and burning. by composting slaughterhouse waste nutrients are recycled back soil. the high fat slaughterhouse waste with high fat and protein content is excellent substrate for anaerobic digestion hence methane production. alkaline hydration has ability to inactivate almost all known microorganism (franke-whittle & insam, 2013; kabeyi, 2022; moses jeremiah barasa kabeyi & oludolapo akanni olanrewaju, 2022). these wastes have potential to pollute the environment like air, water, and soil, if left untreated or is poorly handled(selormey et al., 2021). the most used method of slaughterhouse waste disposal is landfilling which pollutes the environment in form of greenhouse gas emissions, pungent or bad smell/odor and leachate management. for high waste loads and stringent environmental regulations, anaerobic digestion is an appropriate method for slaughterhouse treatment(selormey et al., 2021). slaughterhouse waste is energy rich having high concentrations of carbohydrates, mainly in the like lactose, proteins and lipids(selormey et al., 2021). main inhibitors of slaughterhouse to biogas production are high concentrations of ammonia, long chain fatty acids and hydrogen sulphide as they inhibit methanogenic activities as they are often digester upsets(moses jeremiah barasa kabeyi & oludolapo akanni olanrewaju, 2021a, 2021b; selormey et al., 2021). the general methane potential of slaughterhouse waste streams generally ranges from 49.5 to 650.9 mlch4 gvs−1 while energy potential can meet the entire needs of the slaughterhouse from mixed waste stream and still have excess for commercial use like export of electricity or sale of biogas and biomethane(kabeyi & olenwaraju, 2020; kabeyi & oludolapo, 2020c, 2020f; ware & power, 2016). there is a global determination to fight environmental degradation, guarantee food security and stabilize environment to realize sustainable development by use of green sources of energy (kabeyi & oludolapo, 2020b, proceedings of the international conference on industrial engineering and operations management istanbul, turkey, march 7-10, 2022 ieom society international 2287",,,"moses jeremiah barasa kabeyi 22064693@dut4life.ac.za industrial engineering department, durban university of technology, durban south africa oludolapo akanni olanrewaju oludolapoo@dut.ac.za industrial engineering department, durban university of technology, durban south africa","References

240,Sugarcane Molasses To Energy Conversion For Sustainable  Production And Energy Transition,"bioethanol is a potential replacement for the conventional fuels mainly gasoline because it possesses similar and few superior properties that can help reduce greenhouse emissions and fossil fuel reserves. the sugar industry is in a serious crisis in many developing countries due to cash flow challenges and inability to produce sugar cost effectively. the market is flooded with sugar from cheap producing countries. diversification into ethanol manufacturer is one of the options to increase their competitiveness. this study examines the feasibility of establishing an ethanol plant for sugar factories. the study demonstrated the potential ethanol production a sugar factory to create an additional revenue stream and production of a potential renewable energy resource. ethanol production process involves a series of stages starting with fermentation of the molasses. the fermentation product is distilled to separate ethanol and water through fractionation. the main parts of an ethanol plant include, the fermenter, boilers, condensers, and distillation columns, all well sized and processes. ethanol can be blended with petrol to make a fuel blend for automotive applications besides other industrial applications. the production and use of ethanol from sugarcane molasses will improve the economic sustainability of sugar factories and farmers, improve the gross domestic product and food security due to value addition created and conserve the environment by substitute for fossil fuels if used as a fuel. the conversion of sugar cane to molasses is about 4%, about 20% of molasses is converted to ethanol by fermentation. the molasses and ethanol yield of sugar factories of varying can crushing capacity. actual output of molasses is a function of cane milled while the actual ethanol capacity is based on the molasse produced. milling is affected by many factors like planned and forced outage as well as availability of sugarcane for milling by factories. ethanol as an energy resource can be used to substitute diesel and gasoline fuel in engines and other applications. key words ethanol from molasses; bioethanol from sugarcane; bioethanol; fermentation; ethanol production; ethanol plant design. 1. introduction bioethanol has established itself as a feasible substitute for conventional fuels particularly gasoline and can be used directly or as a blend. these has dual benefits of reduced emissions and consumption of gasoline which is a non- renewable energy resource (edeh, 2020). molasses is one of the cheapest feedstock for ethanol production produced as a by-product of sugar production in sugar factories. biogas has a wide range of industrial and domestic applications like beverage manufacture, manufacture of glycerol, acetic acid, baker’s yeast, and lysine as well as animal feed and even fertilizer(carioca & leal, 2011; wang et al., 2021). one of the leading goals for humanity globally is to produce renewable energy that is easily accessible, effective and safe to use (núñez caraballo et al., 2021). the global concern over greenhouse gas emissions and global warming have accentuated the need for sustainable and environmentally friendly energy sources to replace fossil fuels biofuels have a potential to contribute towards the achieving environmental goals and energy demand(huang et al., 2020; moses jeremiah barasa kabeyi & oludolapo akanni olanrewaju, 2022b; kabeyi & oludolapo, 2020b). ethanol is an important proceedings of the international conference on industrial engineering and operations management istanbul, turkey, march 7-10, 2022 ieom society international 2299",,,"moses jeremiah barasa kabeyi * mkabeyi@yahoo.com industrial engineering department, durban university of technology, durban south africa oludolapo akanni olanrewaju oludolapoo@dut.ac.za industrial engineering department, durban university of technology, durban south africa *corresponding author, contacts: 22064693@dut4life.ac.za; mkabeyi@uonbi.ac.ke",
241,A Techno-Economic Assessment Of Diesel To Gas Power  Plant Conversion,"diesel is the main fuel for use in industrial, transport, and in diesel power plants; unfortunately, it is polluting and non-renewable. this study proposes conversion of a 120 mw diesel engine power plant is converted to a natural gas-powered plant with the objective of reducing emissions and cost of power by avoiding and reducing generation from heavy fuel oil. the study showed that the use of natural gas simultaneously reduces the cost of generation per kwh and emissions, particularly sox. the conversion process involves modification of the fuel injection system to cope with new fuel injection and ignition requirements, new control for fuel injection and reduced air to fuel ratio and lowering of the engines’ compression ratios through increase of the engine cylinder clearance volume. these fuel savings will influence renegotiation of the power purchase agreement resulting into lower tariffs, higher load factor and power plant utilization which translates to more revenue and reduced unit cost of power with lower environmental impact as well as better return on investment from the largest grid connected diesel power plant in east and central africa. this study showed that dual fuel diesel power plants running on both natural gas and diesel exhibit better performance indicators in terms of engine specific fuel consumption, engine brake thermal efficiency, diesel engine indicated thermal efficiency, the power plant electricity generating unit cost of power, the total engine emissions and hence leading to less environmental impact. therefore, the engine fuel conversion will reduce the cost of power and emissions. key words diesel power plants, internal combustion engines; diesel to gas engine conversion; fossil fuel power plants; natural gas power plants. 1. introduction diesel is the main fuel for use in many industrial, transport, and in diesel power plants. however, it is polluting and non-renewable (arefin et al., 2020). hence, there is a dual need to reduce emissions and cost of power from diesel engine power plants (niemi, 1997). the current trend of using diesel fuel has a negative impact to consumers in terms of high electricity tariffs (andae, 2017).the environmental impact of diesel power plants includes emission of sox, nox emissions and oil spills and leakages to the environment (barasa, 2020; jeremiah, 2018). the emissions also react with the ozone layer leading to its depletion. the greenhouse gases are responsible for the global warming in addition to other health effects to humans like chronic respiratory diseases, lung cancer, heart diseases, and damage to brain, liver and kidneys. on average basis, it costs ksh. 6.00 (6 us cents) to produce 1 kwh of electricity using natural gas (eurostat, 2020) which is much lower compared to diesel power generation which costs about ksh. 30 (us cents 30) (andae, 2017; kabeyi & olanrewaju, 2020b). therefore, conversion to natural gas will reduce the cost of power generation. proceedings of the international conference on industrial engineering and operations management istanbul, turkey, march 7-10, 2022 ieom society international 2312",,"Conversion of diesel engine power plant to dual fuel diesel power plant using both natural gas and diesel has better performance indicators in terms of specific fuel consumption, brake thermal efficiency, indicated thermal efficiency, unit cost of generated power and total emissions and hence less environmental impact. Therefore, conversion will reduce the cost of electricity generation and amount of pollutants associated with diesel in power generation. The conversion will also lead better return on investment of the plant because of reduction in fuel related costs. Conversion from diesel fuel powered engines to full gas and dual fuel (gas and diesel) is both technically and financially feasible. Partial conversion to dual fuel mode is faster, cheaper, and more feasible as it requires less modifications and allows for more fuel diversity. The main engine modification done was reduction in compression ratio. The conversion will reduce specific fuel consumption reduces by 523.28 kg/h which will lead to reduction in the cost of fuel and related environmental impact. The main challenge of conversion of an existing facility is generation interruption and extra investment in storage and handling infrastructure for gas and the need to renegotiate the existing power purchase agreement. The long impact on the energy transition is delay in the achievement of zero carbon emissions. And the risk of creating transition related carbon lock-in and stranded assets by developing natural gas infrastructure during the global energy transition.","moses jeremiah barasa kabeyi * mkabeyi@yahoo.com industrial engineering department, durban university of technology, durban south africa oludolapo akanni olanrewaju oludolapoo@dut.ac.za industrial engineering department, durban university of technology, durban south africa *corresponding author, contacts: 22064693@dut4life.ac.za; mkabeyi@uonbi.ac.ke",

245,Preliminary Design Of A Cogeneration Plant For A 120 Mw  Diesel Engine Power Plant,"the conventional method of electric power generation in diesel power plants involves running of a generator directly coupled to an engine which releases exhaust gases at high temperature to the atmosphere. this is wasteful as recoverable heat energy is wasted to the environment through exhaust heat and the engine cooling and lubrication system. in this, a study performance analysis was done to determine the performance of the 120 mw kipevu iii power plant and feasibility of developing a cogeneration plant using a rankine cycle steam turbine with exhaust gas boiler for waste heat to steam conversion. it was established that about 10 mw extra electric power can be generated by developing a rankine cycle cogeneration plant from the combined 119.7 mw kipevu iii diesel engine power plant hence 8.4% extra electric power. this will lead to dual benefit more power output and hence revenue, reduced impact on the environment by avoiding use of extra oil to generate up to 8 mw power and reduced cost of power because of lower specific fuel generation and profits on fuel energy consumed. therefore, cogeneration is a more efficient use of fuel in diesel engine power plants with financial, energy and environmental benefits. key words combined heat and power; diesel power plant; exhaust gas boiler; greenhouse gas emissions; kipevu iii power plant. 1. introduction the high efficiency of compression-ignition or diesel engines has endeared themselves as a leading power source in transport especially heavy-duty vehicles and in diesel power plants. the engines are also finding themselves in light- duty cars which were dominated by petrol or gasoline engines. the main challenge of diesel engines is the emissions mainly in the form of carbon dioxide, nox due to oxidation of nitrogen in the air at high combustion temperatures., particulate matter (pm) and sulphur dioxide from oxidation of sulphur component of the fuel (iea, 2021; kabeyi & oludolapo, 2020a, 2020i).diesel power plants constitute diesel engines and auxiliary systems of the power plant. diesel power plants convert fossil fuels to electricity using diesel engines as generator prime movers(ogunkunle & ahmed, 2020). the diesel power plants are widely used in off grid electricity generation, emergency power applications and grid electricity supply mainly as peak load and emergency power plants especially in developing countries (katiraei & abbey, 2007). other than fossil fuel combustion in coal and diesel power plants, there are various generation technologies like cogeneration that can be used to generate electricity cost effectively while reducing carbon emissions (sims et al., 2003). diesel power plants are mainly used as standby generating units alongside grid power supply or grid connected units for supply of peak power (idc technologies, 2020; kabeyi & oludolapo, 2020h). the construction of diesel power plants consists of the diesel engine prime mover, the generator set and supporting auxiliaries and systems(idc proceedings of the international conference on industrial engineering and operations management istanbul, turkey, march 7-10, 2022 ieom society international 2348",,,"moses jeremiah barasa kabeyi * 22064693@dut4life.ac.za industrial engineering department, durban university of technology, durban south africa oludolapo akanni olanrewaju oludolapoo@dut.ac.za industrial engineering department, durban university of technology, durban south africa *corresponding author, contacts: 22064693@dut4life.ac.za; mkabeyi@uonbi.ac.ke","References

246,A Systematic Review On Contractual Challenges In  Construction Industry During A Pandemic Situation,"this paper aims to develop a systematic review on the contractual challenges faced by the construction industry in a pandemic situation. the construction industry and its stakeholders had never experienced a pandemic such as covid 19 after the spanish flu in the 1920s. hence, many disputes are evolving within the construction industry based on contractual provisions. for the systematic literature review (slr), the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews (prisma) statement was used as a formal systematic review guideline. data were obtained through articles from the year 2020 to 2022. the analysis includes 20 articles filtered using 328 articles from emerald, science direct, and scopus databases. the study only reviewed the contractual challenges and indicated 15 contractual challenges strongly connected with project cost and time escalation. disruption in project works, issues in the supply chain, labour shortage and productivity loss, delay payments, and nine others were recognised via systematic literature review as the main contractual challenges the industry encounters during a pandemic. furthermore, future researchers are encouraged to investigate proper solutions to minimise the destructive impacts of the respective issues to the construction stakeholders. key words contractual, challenges, pandemic, construction industry, covid 1. introduction the construction industry plays a leading role as a fundamental pillar in any country’s economy (famiyeh et al. 2017). according to mokhtariani et al. (2017), time, cost, and quality represent the main attributes of a construction project, which cannot be accurately determined or evaluated before contracting and ceasing the project. the success of construction projects is one of the frequently discussed subject matter in project management (thomas and fernández 2008). this success refers to the project completion within expected time and cost and achieving scope objectives (ika 2008). frimpong et al. (2003) stated that project success accomplishes project objectives and goals as planned-it means successful technical performance and performing within budgeted cost and scheduled time. the construction industry is unique and continuously facing rapid changes (enshassi et al. 2009). in addition, construction projects involve numerous risks, and management of these risks also comes under project management (ali and kamaruzzaman 2012). memon et al. (2011) stated that due to the nature of the construction industry, it perpetually faces serious problems, including low productivity, low quality, delays, and cost overrun. according to mills (2001), the construction industry is an excellent example of a more dynamic, risky, and challenging business. tarawneh (2014) identified that the construction environment is characterised by a high level of competition, complex operations, high-risk conditions, and stressful and knowledgeable clients. coronavirus/ covid 19 pandemic is the current serious problem the construction industry faces like other world industries (bailey et al. 2020). due to the continuity of covid 19, governments and the private sectors of many countries view this pandemic may drastically impacting the economy of any country (franzese 2020). therefore, most countries have decided to limit people’s movements and encouraged them to adhere to the work from home (wfh) concept. however, the inability to accomplish the wfh concept in the construction sector is an issue due to project members’ high involvement in onsite activities (gamil and alhagar 2020). in this context, several challenges and constraints are directly set upon the construction industry, including project time and cost increment due to disruptions in site works and material supply (jreidini 2020). proceedings of the international conference on industrial engineering and operations management istanbul, turkey, march 7-10, 2022 ieom society international 2361",,,"(covid 19) r.d.w.w.jayathilaka and k.g.a.s.waidyasekara department of building economics, university of moratuwa, sri lanka vimarshijayathilaka@gmail.com, anuradha@uom.lk","References

247,Integrated Structural Damage Assessment Using Aerial  Images For Bridges,"in the present research, an efficient structural damage assessment approach was investigated using aerial drone images for bridges. in the paper, a damage assessment algorithm was presented using aerial images for bridges in the us. image processing was explained and applied in the damage assessment procedure. visual survey and bridge inspection procedures were described and the applications in the us were provided as a part of the study. a representative bridge analysis was presented as a case study and in the conclusion, the damage assessment process was detailed. as technology develops, structural damage detection gets faster for transportation systems. aerial images can be integrated into the structural damage assessment methodology. collected images can be entered in image processing algorithms to identify damage patterns in highways. since image processing is a fast and accurate technology of processing images to identify and compare differences and unexpected incidences, it can be used particularly for natural disasters and emergency cases. periodic automated image processing of aerial images can help inspect wide areas to detect various damages in buildings, structures, bridges, highways, and infrastructures. this can offer time and cost savings in the long run. pre-event and post-event satellite images from the disaster areas hit by earthquakes and tsunamis can be investigated using a propriety automated damage detection system to determine the structural damage caused by these natural disasters. drone images can also be used in such investigations. such investigations can be improved with high-resolution, real-time, and multiple consecutive aerial drone images. the advantages of aerial drone images include safety and reasonable cost of equipment use. an automated structural damage detection technique would be beneficial for structural damage assessment to examine buildings, bridges, and highways using drones.","aerial images, drone","In this paper, a detailed investigation was presented about the damage detection approach for bridges. The damage assessment process is a very critical process for the bridge systems. With new technologies, it gets more accurate and rapid as detailed in the present research. In the paper, the image processing approach was given as a part of the damage assessment, and it is one of the new technologies to implement in the damage assessment. In image processing, defining the differences between pre-event and post-event is very important and makes the results meaningful. Once the detection algorithm is established, based on such different definitions, the next step is to integrate all evaluations in the overall damage detection procedure. Damages are defined in the structural components and their effects on the entire system as given in categorization. The damage level can be defined in the urban scale, not only the structural component scale. For instance, a damaged bridge is not only defining a structural member but also represents the blockage to access the city. Therefore, such integrated algorithms are important. In the present research, a damage assessment algorithm has been developed and implemented on a model. This model represents a real city with all structural components as buildings, bridges, highways, and infrastructures. Images were compared for pre-event and post-event conditions. Damage detection has been carried out throughout the entire city with its all components. Segmentation was carried out for damage assessment procedures. Damage levels were determined through the developed algorithm. In the proposed damage assessment algorithm in this paper, an image detection tool was used to determine the damage profile for existing highways. In the research, a damage detection algorithm has been applied for the determination of damages. In big cities, damage detection is a critical problem and needs more implementation with real-life examples. This is also important to save lives after disasters. Disasters are causing live losses and live losses should be prevented in the cities in short term and long-term planning and scheduling. As detailed in Figure 6 and Figure 7, bridge behavior was determined by Finite Element analysis. Such investigation gives accurate results in the investigation of the bridges. Especially for old bridges, determining behavioral shapes and displacement variations are very critical to determine which is called health monitoring of bridges. In addition to this approach, image assessment can be implemented in the assessment to get a more accurate result. As detailed in Tables 2 to 4, grades are assigned to bridges and bridges can be described. With such a description, bridge inspection can be done in an easier and faster way with accurate results. Results are used in the decision-making process at each step. The structural assessment would be integrated with visual assessment. Linking these two investigations validates the structural resistance of existing buildings and bridges. As a result of this study, an integrated damage assessment philosophy has been introduced as an urban civil tool. Such assessment is very important to complete for structural health and lifesaving. The most common way to investigate the bridges is structural assessment. However, only one tool cannot be sufficient for damage detection. It should be noted that each tool has a different perspective and all of them should be used and integrated. Over the years, with developed technology, it is more common for an accurate evaluation. Especially for bridges, surface failure detection is the most common practice. Transit agencies are looking for integrated evaluations and assessments for existing bridges. The proposed approach can be adopted by the agencies for accurate damage detection for bridges.","kasim a. korkmaz school of visual and built environments eastern michigan university ypsilanti, mi, usa kkorkmaz@emich.edu munther abualkibash school of information security and applied computing eastern michigan university ypsilanti, mi, usa mabualki@emich.edu",
248,Innovative Mixed-Reality Simulations To Enhance  Collaborative Team Skills In Global Engineering Teams: A,"in the age of globalization and internationalization, the management of a global team with diverse backgrounds is one of the biggest challenges to an organization to gain competitive advantages in the global markets (shrm, 2020). to ingratiate the need of the expectations of the international labor market and requirements of the organization in a global world, global business management education needs to provide students with skills and abilities to be able to successfully collaborate and work in diverse global teams in order to surmount language and cultural barriers which hinder team building and effective communication in global teams (chen et al., 2021). advances in mixed reality (mr) enable interdisciplinary teams across the globe to work collaboratively on projects requiring technical and engineering skills. mr merges the real environment and virtual environment to provide a hybrid platform for interaction through manipulating virtual objects by using realistic gesture-based interaction. the visualization of 3d models on real or larger scales enables realistic and intuitive experiences while enabling individuals to remotely collaborate as teams. mr also enables remote meetings with virtual avatars displayed in the vision which benefits the global team collaboration with people around the world. we propose a research study to measure the effectiveness of mr in helping learners’ develop collaborative skills in global engineering teams. specifically, we design an mr simulation in which teams composed of three members work remotely to complete engineering related tasks in real-time applying their technical knowledge, skills, and abilities while developing team skills such as knowledge sharing, debriefing, feedback exchange (crans, proceedings of the international conference on industrial engineering and operations management istanbul, turkey, march 7-10, 2022 ieom society international 2381",,,"research proposal mesut akdere professor of human resource development polytechnic institute purdue university west lafayette, in 47907, usa makdere@purdue.edu yeling jiang doctoral candidate of human resource development polytechnic institute purdue university west lafayette, in 47907, usa jiang424@purdue.edu minsoo choi doctoral student of computer graphics technology polytechnic institute purdue university west lafayette, in 47907, usa choi714@purdue.edu",

We performed a bibliometric analysis of scientific documents, subject categories' distribution, publications' venues, and geographic distribution. Our analysis shows that in the pandemic years, the research has been done in various subject areas, but 'Social Sciences,' 'Business Management' and 'Computer science' are the most frequent subject categories. There has been significant growth in the field. A small group of productive countries contributed to substantial articles: the top 10 countries contributed to ~77% of the total documents. The United States has the leading position in global sentiment analysis research. Similar to other research studies, this study is restricted in some directions. First, the data for the study is collected from the Scopus database. In future studies, other well- known databases could be included to collect data. Future studies can also analyze tourism-related books and other publications. We hope that this study will be useful for researchers trying to do targeted research in the sentiment analysis field for different domains and understanding the different aspects such as significant publications type, countries and keywords that have been used during the period of COVID-19.

252,4.0 In 40 Series: An Extension Program To Develop  Awareness For Industry 4.0,"“4.0 in 40 series : industry 4.0 applied at the best organizations” is an extension project developed by the research group in industry 4.0 (gpi4 – grupo de pesquisa em indústria 4.0) of the federal institute of são paulo (ifsp) that produced monthly webinars to both academic and industry communities in order to increase awareness around industry 4.0 and the post-graduate course in industry 4.0 that was implemented while the series was ongoing. the objective of this paper is to present the utilized strategies to keep proximity, even virtually, with our student base, society in general and partners of ifsp during the isolation period imposed by covid-19. we used the webinars as a digital marketing tool to generate awareness and keep the target audience engaged with both the school and the theme of industry 4.0. our results show that the objectives set for the 4.0 in 40 series were achieved.","extension programs, webinars","Even without the continuous increase in synchronous and asynchronous attendance the project was able to meet the expectations drawn at the beginning of 2020 and achieve the connection between IFSP and the exterior community as well as obtaining relevant information to develop the Post-Graduate course. The target synchronous attendance of 10 (in 2020) and 15 (in 2021) viewers was achieved during the 18 months the project ran, with continuous increase in members and awareness about Industry 4.0 and IFSP. The target audience represented the expectations, with a larger portion being students, which was one of the goals of the project – to maintain contact between students and the Institution during the pandemic. The events also allowed IFSP and GPI4 to increase awareness about the Post-Graduate Specialization Course in Industry 4.0 that was launched in the second semester of 2021. For the first enrollment cycle there were a total of 186 applicants for 20 vacancies on the program - a 9.3 student/vacancy ratio. The ratio achieved was the second highest ratio of all courses (technical, graduate and post-graduate) of the IFSP Sorocaba campus in that semester, with higher values than stablished courses such as Electronics Technician Course that is being offered since 2016. All obstacles to proper publicize and accomplish the synchronous events were overcome, and the change in streaming platform to Stream Yard showed to be the correct decision. With a regular monthly flux of Webinars and a standardized media format (for both banners and texts) the project achieved a steady method to create and publicize the events, yielding in the necessary online viewers target for both 2020 and 2021 years. YouTube was also a steady platform for the views with good tools to engage and interact with online viewers. Even though the Project will not continue in 2022 due to the return of presential activities and regular classes, the experiment showed itself to be effective and the learning experiences for the project members as well as the audience is unique.

261,A Literature Review On Multi-Echelon Inventory   Management Policies: Case Of Assembly Systems,"inventory control presents a major issue in supply chain management. many businesses understand the importance of an effective inventory management system. when dealing with demand fluctuations, proper inventory management assists in providing a high level of customer service. the necessity for an integrated approach to inventory management had become vital especially in the current complex supply chain networks where inventories are located throughout the system as raw materials or finished goods. multi-echelon inventory management allows considering various challenges and issues related to the interdependencies between different stages of the supply chain. stocks of raw materials, components, and finished goods are all interrelated in production. multiple multi-echelon inventory models for production systems were developed by researchers to solve issues related to either the supply chain efficiency or responsiveness. in this paper, we provide a literature review on multi-echelon inventory management policies for the assembly structure. different alternatives for managing multi-echelon inventory systems for the case of assembly systems are generated.",assembly systems,"Multi-echelon inventory management allows for the effective management of inventories while considering interdependencies between different facilities. In this paper, we presented a literature review on multi-echelon inventory management policies for the case of assembly systems. A classification of several multi-echelon inventory models developed by researchers for assembly systems was provided. After that, different alternatives for multiechelon inventory systems for the assembly structure were formulated. The definition of the multi-echelon inventory policies for assembly systems and the literature review conducted allowed for generating different alternatives for multi-echelon inventory management for the case of assembly systems. The detailed process for formulating the alternatives was presented in this paper. The process resulted in the formulation of five different alternatives that are based on the main inventory policies used in the assembly systems. Lastly, the literature review conducted, and the alternatives generated in this paper will help simulate and compare different options of multi-echelon inventory management for assembly systems to guide decision-makers in the field to choose and validate the appropriate alternatives that respond to their preferences in terms of the level efficiency and responsiveness.

262,How Dynamic Capability In The Port Industry? Systematic  Literature Review,this study aims to know the clear concept of theory and the proper implementation of dynamic capability in the port industry. this study uses the systematic literature review (s.l.r.) method. there were two steps in using the s.l.r. method: setting inclusion criteria and locating and selecting the potential studies. the strategy used in this study was by carrying out a computerized search using multiple,"emerald, sciencedirect, wiley","This paper aims to determine the relationship between dynamic capabilities in the port sector. This relationship can be demonstrated by describing and implementing dynamic capability in the industry. The model framework could describe dynamic capability by focusing on an expanded competitiveness matrix. Also, it used a strategy that focuses on dynamic adaptability to the external development environment and internal resources. The model framework has benefits for using appropriate strategies in maintaining central competitiveness. Moreover, a model framework focussed on port competitiveness combined with a detailed trading model and transportation network. Also could be used because this framework model has an essential role in describing the impact of strategy on the other port development and the development of hinterland transport in any specific socio-economic conditions and sectors. Dynamic capabilities apply focussed on productivity and flexibility of workgroups to achieve competitive advantage. However, strategies can also be used, such as strategies that focus on mergers and alliances, implementing complex adaptive systems, implementing hierarchical procedures, providing or replacing economies of scale approaches, balancing strategic responses and teamwork. Also, use the other variables that supported the implementation strategy on port authority, where port authority also could play an essential role in increasing efficiency and competitiveness toward the port. It's hoped that this strategy could help the port respond to the complex and dynamic environment and maintain and achieve a competitive advantage in the port sector. This study has some limitations. First, this study focussed on scientific articles published on a trusted source. Second, this study concentrated on empirical studies in scientific journals in the port sector and was published in 2000-2021 in peer-review journals. Third, this study focussed on Dynamic Capability in the port sector. And the last study concentrated on scientific articles that were published using English. Future research could develop research related to this research topic on other industries, such as industrial manufacturing, service, pharmacy, telecommunication, etc. 7. Implications for Practice The findings of this study have two implications for management practices. First, the port manager should be responsive, seeing opportunities and following environmental conditions in any situation. To do this, the port manager could use the dynamic capability as a supporting tool in managing the port to increase productivity and flexibility of the labor group and support the implementation of strategies in the port sector. In addition, the use of dynamic capability could also help port managers apply it to particular ports and hinterland ports. Second, the port should improve and renew the existing resources that focus on using dynamic capability as support tools. Therefore, the port still has the same position or even higher position than their competitors in facing the dynamic and competitive environment. Other than that, the port also should make good use of these repaired and renewed resources to achieve a competitive advantage in the strict industrial environment.","dicky hida syahchari, hardijanto saroso, cooky tri adhikara and melisa management department, binus business school, bina nusantara university, jakarta, 11480, indonesia dicky.syahchari@binus.edu, hardijanto.saroso@binus.edu, ctadhikara@binus.ac.id, melisa017@binus.ac.id",
263,Measuring Social Presence In Virtual Social Game  Experience,"the pandemic outbreak has caused a major crisis and change in all areas, resulting all sectors need to innovate and adapt to this condition. limitations and restrictions have made interactivity between human beings decreasing or even, disappearing. entertainment sector, especially gaming sector tried to resolve this interactivity problems by creating a virtual social game experience (vsge), which is a form of social game which is played virtually with interactivity and social presence as its basic principles. this study aims to identify social presence in vsge including the variable and what might cause it. the social presence in vsge is measured by looking at the sense of co-presence, behaviour of the players, and players’ psychological involvement when ‘experiencing’ the game. mixed method, both quantitative and qualitative methods were used for this study. online questionnaire was used to gain the perception of the players regarding social presence using likert scale, and fgd was carried out to expand the answers of the participants. the results of this research indicate that vsge is capable to facilitate players’ need in interactivity and social presence during the game. the host played an important role in leading the game and providing a good connection with the players.","virtual, game, experience","Virtual social game experience (VSGE) was built to facilitate the need for social interaction between people in the virtual world, and this study was hoped to give feedbacks and suggestions for its further development. Our results revealed that VSGE can give the players more positive interaction between players, especially in terms of co-presence, psychological involvement like emotions and feelings, and the players’ behavioural engagement during the game. Happy emotions and feelings tend to occur more than sadness or anger during the game. Emotional effects can also be influenced by the theme of the game, game content, and the characters in VSGE game. The emotions of the players can also be led by the host who is leading the game story line. That is why, host plays an important role during this game. However, there is always room for improvement. There are several aspects that are scored ‘Low’ in terms of behavioural engagement; they are social engagement and environmental engagement. In social engagement part, competitiveness and moments/stories sharing did not occur much during the game, and in environmental engagement part, we found that the chance of exploring digital world is very low. We believe with bits of improvement in challenge types and plots, the game could increase the social engagement. Also, by improving the gaming technology and more creative use of the platform, we are positive that this game would create a better environmental engagement. For example, in the future, an app integrated with VSGE game can create a more immersive experience. Moving forward, social presence in general is needed in every online social experience, especially VSGE. Since VSGE tries to bridge the gap between digital and physical world, many aspects of social presence need to be observed and presented in the game.","christabel parung faculty of creative industries university of surabaya surabaya, indonesia christabelannora@staff.ubaya.ac.id dian prianka faculty of creative industries university of surabaya surabaya, indonesia dianprianka@staff.ubaya.ac.id viviany faculty of creative industries university of surabaya surabaya, indonesia viviany@staff.ubaya.ac.id",

VSGE also a host-oriented game, it cannot play by themselves. VSGE is also universal, it is not necessary to use such high spec console or computer to play the game. In terms of gaming topology, the differentiation between VSGE and its predecessor is not much, but in each topology, VSGE has its unique approach to enhance the social interaction between players, such as in the Space topology, VSGE might be omnipresent and vagrant depends to the game, but its host oriented feature may distinct VSGE with the predecessors as the host has its special role to control and guide the game. However, for a better playing experience, VSGE require a universal-easy to access web app to support the visual components of the game.","dian prianka, christabel parung, viviany faculty of creative industries university of surabaya surabaya, indonesia dianprianka@staff.ubaya.ac.id, christabelannora@staff.ubaya.ac.id, viviany@staff.ubaya.ac.id",
265,Modeling Mode Choice Preference In A Mexican University  With Discrete Choice Models,"the study of the mode choice for urban regions has increased, with a growing set of recent works using joint methodologies of data gathering and modeling with machine learning models. this work details the design and application of a mobility survey to a private urban university in the north of mexico. decision tree based, machine learning models for multiclass classification, are shown to be effective with datasets in which categorical data predominates, having a better performance than the widely applied econometric models covered in literature. the interpretability of decision trees helps to identify relevant variables that influence modal choice. it can be concluded that, for the studied sample, people’s awareness of their access to collective modes is the most decisive factor, and thus the efforts of institutions to promote investments and availability of better modes will determine the mode’s adoption rate.","transportation, mode choice study","Every stage of a mobility study is interconnected. For example, an adjusted survey that considers the nature of its population of study and its current situation, along with adequate data processing, allows the development of effective choice models. Additionally, we note that machine learning models have a better performance than econometric models when using categorical variables that result from the perception of a surveyed community. Perhaps the econometric models would have a better outcome if working with quantitative data instead of focusing on categorical data. It was also found that the municipality is the feature that mostly determines the UDEM community’s value of time. People who live closer to UDEM have a higher value of time, which might be because they have the idea that they don’t have to spend much time traveling to and from UDEM since they live close. Also, it is possible to change people’s modal choice regardless of their socioeconomic level. The promotion of Urbvan, for example, would make more students know about the service and more would use it regularly. This would have an impact on the number of people who stop using cars to use Urbvan instead. This work was large and has room to develop a wider range of analysis and solutions for any of the stages followed in its execution. This work creates opportunities to further develop any of the proposed stages in the methodology or to explore alternatives on some of the modeling or data gathering activities.","juan estrada-garcía, juliana figueroa, ezequiel gonzález, jenny díaz-ramírez department of engineering universidad de monterrey san pedro garza garcia, mexico juanalberto.estrada@udem.edu, juliana.figueroa@udem.edu, ezequiel.gonzalezl@udem.edu, jenny.diaz@udem.edu",

269,Modeling & Optimization Of A Multi-Echelon Multiobjective Humanitarian Logistics Model Using,"humanitarian logistics management has recently become a trendy buzzword because of the number of natural disasters in recent years. managing relief & logistics networks properly when disaster strikes are of great importance, as any negligence may result in a severe penalty such as loss of precious lives & public property. the unpredictable and unexpected nature of natural calamities is another concern. in a catastrophic event, decision- making usually involves choosing the best locations for aid distribution, distributing relief goods to different demand nodes, and managing the appropriate routes for transportation of relief goods, medicines, etc. this study proposes a multi-echelon multi-objective logistics model based on a multi-objective approach to finding optimal locations for setting up regional relief distribution centers with the minimum facility set up cost and to see the optimal quantity of goods to be flowed between nodes and stages of the relief supply chain to minimize distribution and supply costs, and the unmet demand under uncertain conditions. key words humanitarian logistics, emergency facility location, relief distribution, multi-objective optimization 1. introduction in humanitarian logistics, the goal is to ensure that supplies are delivered and stored promptly during natural disasters and compound emergencies to affected communities. while most often used in retail supply chains, logistics are essential tools in disaster relief operations. a crucial issue in humanitarian logistics is the kind and quantity of resources, the way of procuring and storing relief goods, the means of transportation to the affected regions, etc. (zdamar and ertem, 2015). performance in humanitarian relief chains is very tough to measure due to some complex characteristics that humanitarian operations have, such as very unpredictable & uncertain nature of demand, difficulty to obtain data from procedures, unpredictable working environment, the impact of unknown variables, like geography or weather, etc. (holguín-veras et al., 2013). this research attempts to measure and optimize the performance of a relief network considering the uncertainty that a disastrous event possesses. a relief supply chain has three levels required for decision-making: supplier level, regional distribution center level, and affected area level. very few researchers have considered the decision-making in all three tiers of humanitarian logistics networks, including facility location selection and relief distribution. most of them took a deterministic approach to supply and demand to avoid the complexity of model formulation and optimization. in other words, the development of a method that will address all these issues in a single model is still unexplored. 2. literature review the humanitarian logistics field focuses on three phases of planning in the disaster lifecycle: preparation, response, and recovery (özdamar and ertem, 2015). recently, the area of emergency supply chain management was reviewed (jahre et al., 2007) in terms of practitioner contributions for humanitarian logistics, preparation, and reconstruction-related studies. according to altay et al. (2006), disaster management includes three phases (pre, during & post). using a multi-commodity, multi-modal network flow model for disaster relief operations, haghani and oh (1996) proposed a formulation and solution. barbarosoglu et al. (2002) proposed a bi-level modeling framework to address routing and transportation issues during the initial response phase of disaster management. proceedings of the international conference on industrial engineering and operations management istanbul, turkey, march 7-10, 2022 ieom society international 2550",,"A scenario-based technique was utilized to turn the deterministic model into a stochastic model in order to deal with the unknown components of the relief chain. The created Multi-objective Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) issue was solved using the Branch and Cut Algorithm. This study implies that a more effective and appropriate relief supply logistics model may be constructed if it is as near to the real-world scenario as feasible by integrating all potential risks. The more adaptable the model, the closer it will be to actual situations and the greater the efficiency in terms of lowering both logistical costs and property loss. There are several ways in which this study might be expanded and refined. Reliability concept can also be incorporated in the model to minimize associated risk in the logistics relief network. This model can also be extended to make the decision to evacuate the wounded people and transfer them to a safer place. Fuzzy Rule- Based System can be incorporated into the model to improve its flexibility.

271,The Moderating Role Of Job Enrichment: When Millennial  Characters Have A Negative Relationship On Organizational,"this study determines and proves that implementation of transformational leadership style and the character of the millennial generation development moderated by job enrichment can influence organizational performance optimally. the millennial is a unique generation characteristic and expected to become a successful leader who determines the future trend of leadership style and influences organization performance if they receive some approaches to build their capacity effectively. this study uses a random sampling technique with 160 junior and senior managers of the millennial generation. the data was analyzed with a quantitative approach, which classical assumption test and moderated regression analysis (mra) used spss. this study has found that job enrichment as the moderating variable does not strengthen the influence of transformational leadership on organizational performance and significantly influences millennial characters on organizational performance. it seems that organizations must overcome these challenges to create optimal leadership strategies for millennial employees and design job enrichment programs that suit the needs of millennial managers. further research can be carried out with other case studies using more relevant approaches, analytical methods, and specific leadership theories.",job enrichment,"The classical assumption test concluded that the research data is usually distributed. There are no symptoms of heteroscedasticity or multicollinearity. However, in regression analysis with Moderated Regression Analysis (MRA), the moderating variable often causes multicollinearity problems between independent variables (Liana, 2009). Therefore, this multicollinearity problem does not reduce the predictive power simultaneously but affects the predictive value of an independent variable. Regression testing was carried out in several stages with the results of the feasibility test of the regression model. The regression model in this study can predict the relationship of job enrichment moderating the effect of transformational leadership and millennial character together on organizational performance. The existence of job enrichment as a moderating variable can increase the influence of transformational leadership and millennial character on organizational performance to 71.1% in the regression model of this study. The coefficient of determination can show the magnitude of the contribution of the influence of the independent variable and the moderating variable on the dependent variable. The first and second hypotheses in this study are accepted. Namely, transformational leadership and millennial character have a significant positive effect on organizational performance. The results of this study are consistent with previous researchers' results and prove that if an organization implements and develops a transformational leadership style, it can improve organizational performance optimally. Furthermore, the assumptions related to the characteristics of the millennial generation that can positively influence the achievement of organizational performance are statistically valid and reliable. So, the character of the millennial generation has a positive impact on organizational performance. Based on the results of the individual parameter tests above, it is known that the regression model containing all independent variables and moderating variables, which are calculated together, shows different research results from several other research","performance (case study at social insurance company in indonesia) indri fajria musfiroh, masfu hanik and nugroho j. setiadi management department business management program, business school master program bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia, 11480 indri.musfiroh@binus.ac.id, masfu.hanik@binus.ac.id, nugroho.setiadi@binus.ac.id",
272,"Finding Faculty Dissatisfaction Through Incivility,  Commitment, And Being Engaged","workplace incivility is defined as low-intensity aberrant conduct with an ambiguous purpose to harm the target. uncivil conduct is a stressor that may have negative health consequences. interpersonal abuse may be psychologically damaging to one's self-esteem. incivility may hurt self-esteem, self-efficacy, self-confidence, and well-being. this research aims to look at the elements that contribute to teacher unhappiness. quantitative research is a strategy for evaluating objective hypotheses by investigating the relationship between variables. these variables may then be quantified via tools, resulting in numerical data considered statistically. the final written report contains an introduction, literature and theory review, methods section, results section, and conclusion section. this study used the variance-based structural equation model approach, allowing researchers to examine the model. marketing researchers have developed a greater interest in variance-based sem, commonly known as partial least squares (pls) analysis, in recent years. our result reveals that only variable involvement contributes to teacher discontent. it explains how participation at a particular level may lead to dissatisfaction. this study contributes that incivility itself leads to detrimental and unpleasant feelings. however, incivility does not relate to unhappiness.","dissatisfaction, incivility, commitment, engagement","According to the findings of this research, only involvement contributes to teacher discontent. It explains how participation at a particular level may lead to feelings of dissatisfaction. Other theories, on the other hand, are rejected, such as commitment to faculty discontent, incivility to commitment, incivility to engagement, and incivility to faculty dissatisfaction. This study is beneficial in a variety of ways. For starters, incivility is dreadful and may be detrimental and generate unpleasant feelings in people; nonetheless, people who are exposed to incivility continue to work for the company. Second, even if a person is rude, he or she still feels linked to the people and the organization. Third, incivility does not imply unhappiness. Notably, the findings reveal that academics in Indonesia are more likely to persevere in difficult conditions and stay committed despite their dissatisfaction. This study has limitations when it comes to future research prospects. First, we still need further confirmation from more responses. Our attained responders are still too young to be generalized by the results. Adding new provinces and profiles may assist to boost the robustness. Second, the research approach might be extended to include experiments or qualitative activities. Experimentation will need a longitudinal approach, which will aid research in gaining insight into the dynamic of incivility. The qualitative technique may increase the respondent's inner awareness about their genuine feelings of incivility, commitment, involvement, and faculty discontent.

The framework had the ability to diagnose based to activity level of detail. The designed performance system consisted of 5 metrics in the process level, 13 metrics in the attribute level, and 34 metrics in the metric level. The most important process which could be inferred from the design was plan process with 39.50% of weight. The most important metrics could only be determined after normalizing the metrics to the process level. The most important metric was Accuracy of forecast technique (PAFT) with 39.50% therefore the activity related to this metric plays significant role to the overall performance of supply chain. The designed system had been tested to PT MRS and showed 4 red level metrics in the traffic light system. It is suggested to the company to prioritize on improving the red level metrics. The supply chain performance system had been designed to measure specific to supply chain activity in a company. If company want to use the design for their performance measurement system, it was suggested to adjust the metrics based on the key activities in the company environment and not to fully copy the design. It was suggested for companies using the design for their supply chain measurement system to evaluate the system periodically. Because, over the time the key activities might be different.

278,Automotive Battery Cooling Systems For Electrical Vehicles,"the thermal management of automotive batteries is the key point to ensure the cells durability, vehicle autonomous and safety. nowadays, the chemistries used in automotive field are mainly based on lithium-ion technology. these chemistries are sensitive to the temperature and need to be maintained in a temperature range that allows them to work at their optimum capacity without safety hazards, i.e. between 15°c to 40°c approximatively. below 15°c, the cells cannot deliver their nominal power or accept high current level without any premature ageing. such cold conditions need a pre-conditioning strategy to heat up the battery and a derating of the cell use until they are hot enough. during this time, charging power or acceleration/breaking regeneration of the vehicle are reduced. at the other side of the scale, above 40°c the cells are facing two main problems: capacity losses through thermal ageing and safety issues. that can lead to thermal events and in some extreme cases to thermal runaway: fire propagation inside the battery pack, and at the end vehicle fire. the energy amount involved in such thermal runaway events is so high that it cannot be controlled once started, and should absolutely avoided. in those hot conditions, a preconditioning strategy can occur before any intensive usage to bring the cells at a temperature cold enough to prevent any derating or safety issue. in addition to the external temperature, these kinds of cells release some heat when they are solicited. their internal electrical resistance combined to the amount of current applied heat them up during intensive usage as fast charge and ultra-fast charge, strong and/or repeated accelerations. this heat should be removed thanks to a specific heat exchanger to avoid an over heat and to maintain the cell temperature below 40°c, ideally lower than 35°c. another key parameter to extend the battery life and capacity is the temperature unbalance in the battery pack. the thermal exchanger of the battery should be designed so that all the cells of the battery pack are at the same temperature level along the vehicle life in any conditions. the cell aging being function of its temperature, the goal is to ensure that all the cells of a same battery pack age at the same rate. typically, a temperature unbalance of 5k between all the cells is acceptable. the thermal exchanger should be consequently designed to reach that target. as top leader of tier1 suppliers of battery thermal management systems, valeo has developed along these last 10 years an unique expertise and competitive products that answer to battery thermal management problematics. we propose to review during that keynote the different technologies that we are able to deliver to ensure the thermal comfort of the batteries, function of the thermal constraints, battery pack layouts, casing integrations and system architectures. from passive air systems to high heat transfer coefficient liquid exchangers through refrigerant cooling plates, we will thus present of the pro and cons of each solution, finally to conclude on the trends for the incoming years.","electrical cars, thermal management, battery pack",,jean-damien muller advanced development technical leader battery cooling systems expert valeo thermal systems france jean-damien.muller@valeo.com,
279,Planning And Optimization Of A Post Disaster Multi-Echelon  Humanitarian Logistics Network: A Case Study In,"disaster planning and management has always been challenging for the relief agencies of the underdeveloped counties, since they usually do not have the well organized and well-funded system in place, like the developed counties. the models developed in the previous literatures either did not address all the relevant logistics issues or are often too complicated to be utilized by the underdeveloped countries. to mitigate the casualties caused by disastrous events, post disaster planning is very important. this research has developed a simple but inclusive multi-objective post disaster logistics planning model to addresses issues like distribution of relief commodity and medical supplies, staffing of medical facilities, evacuation of wounded people to the medical facilities, vehicular and transportation management, unsatisfied demands at affected locations etc., while maintaining service equity. the applicability of the proposed model has been tested via a real-world case study based on the recurrent flash flood problem in the sylhet district of bangladesh. a branch-and-cut algorithm has been used via cplex platform to solve the developed linear integer programming model. results have been demonstrated both numerically and graphically to aid the decision maker to properly visualize the solutions, which has offered several important managerial implications and insights on the post disaster management. this way the proposed research is expected to help the decision makers to plan an efficient and effective post disaster logistics network to minimize human suffering, wastage of relief goods, and associated operational costs.",,"and Recommendations This research tried to address various relevant logistics issues, in order to design and optimize the post disaster logistics network. Making sure that adequate amount of aids reaches the demand points, evacuation of the wounded people from the affected area, vehicle management, ensuring equity of distribution, minimization of the overall operational cost, etc. are some of the important post disaster issues addressed in the study. This research used a recurrent flash flooding problem in the Sylhet District of Bangladesh as a test case, to check the effectiveness of the proposed model. The obtained results have been demonstrated both numerically and graphically in the result and discussion section for better visual understanding of the decision maker. The scalarization method has been utilized to handle multiple objectives in this research. The simplicity and ease of handing the weights of the associated objectives in scalarization method will give the decision makers more freedom to generate the solution that they desire. This research is thus expected to help the decision makers in many underdeveloped parts of the world, to plan and develop humanitarian logistics networks, which will not only minimize human suffering and operational cost but also will improve the overall efficiency of the entire aid logistics operation. The research has several limitations, which can be addressed in future research attempts. For instance, more flexibility can be added to the model by incorporating ‘robust optimization’ methodologies in future. Time element has not been considered in this research. Hence, more responsive model can be developed from this research by incorporating time element into it. To make the model more realistic and flexible, a ‘Fuzzy rule-based system’ can be introduced into the future model design. Finally, a second case study can be added with the current one, to demonstrate the efficiency of the developed model to a greater extent.","bangladesh perspective a. b. m. mainul bari department of industrial and production engineering, bangladesh university of engineering and technology, dhaka-1000, bangladesh. e-mail: mainul.ipe@gmail.com k jamie rogers, jay m rosenberger department of industrial & manufacturing systems engineering, the university of texas at arlington, usa e-mail: jrogers@uta.edu, jrosenbe@uta.edu",
280,Exploration Of The Factors Affecting Efficient Production  Planning: A Case Study Of The Ready-Made Garments,"the ready-made garments (rmg) industries are the major contributors to the export-oriented economy of bangladesh. in the current competitive market, efficient production planning has become a key strategy to meet buyers’ timeline and ensure timely shipment of the finished goods. several issues or factors cause major deviation of the actual production from the planned production. this research has explored the major factors that affect the efficient production planning, by causing major deviation of the actual production from the planned schedule, in the rmg industries of bangladesh, by using a multi criteria decision making (mcdm) tool. in this paper, first, the factors affecting the efficient production planning has been identified through expert feedbacks and literature review. then, a decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (dematel) method has been utilized to find out the priority ranking of the identified factors and to explore the interrelationships among the factors through a casual diagram. from the results obtained from this study, ‘low productivity’ has been identified as the most critical of all factors, while ‘fabric delay’ has been identified as the least critical one. the research findings are expected to help the managers of the rmg and other similar industries to enhance the efficiency of their production plan in order to improve their overall profitability.","production planning, priority ranking, rmg industries","This study has explored different factors that influence efficient production planning using DEMATEL method, in perspective of the RMG industries of Bangladesh. Obtained results suggest that ‘low Productivity’, ‘defective product’, and ‘line not balanced’ are the three most important factors, while ‘Fabric delay’ is the least important factor that influences efficient production planning. Obtained results also suggest that ‘Machine Breakdown’, ‘Unskilled Worker’, and ‘Unskilled Worker’ are the most influencing factors in the cause group, i.e., they have significant influence on the other factors. Again, the results suggest that ‘Pre-production Delay’, ‘Line not balanced’, and ‘Frequent Layout change’ are the topmost factors in the effect group, which means they are highly influenced by the factors in the cause group. Based on this research, proper and regular training should be arranged for the managers and the employees, to make them more conscious about the influencing factors to improve the overall productivity of their industry. Although, this research has been carried out in the RMG industries, this technique can be applied to any production-related organization, such as beverage industries, steel appliance manufacturing industries, furniture manufacturing industries, etc. to perform similar study. The research has some limitations as well, on which future researchers can focus to overcome them. For example, the number of experts took part in this research were limited. The future research can be done with a larger number of experts to reduce opinion bias. Moreover, only DEMATEL method has been used in this research.

281,Academic Dishonesty And Financial Reporting Fraud  Intention,"the covid -19 pandemic has significant impact on education system. in mitigating health risks for educators and students, many higher education institutions across the globe opt to apply new ways of teaching and testing; online distance learnings (odl). the odl however lead to adverse effect on academic integrity as the online platform provided more opportunity for students to defraud the system and cheat. thus, the main objective of this study is to investigate the student’s attitude towards academic dishonesty on odl and how such attitude affect financial reporting fraud intention. using a questionnaire suvey of 158 accounting students of malaysian public university, the results show that academic dishonesty attitudes is significantly positive associated with financial reporting fraud intention.","academic dishonesty, intention","Adoption of online education in response to the Covid-19 pandemic across the globe give adverse impact on academic intergrity. Thus, this study aims to examine how academic dishonesty attitudes affect financial fraud intention among Malaysian accounting students.The result shows that there is a significant and positive relationship between academic dishonesty and financial fraud intention. The results suggest that if accounting students student’s attitude is positive towards violating academic rules and regulations and engaging in academic dishonestly activities, it is most likely that his or her decision intentions are inclined toward unethical corporate behavior in future including financial reporting fraud. Therefore, it is crucial for higher education providers in particular Malaysian public universities to strategically plan to create an ethical and integrity education environment.

282,Analysis Of Swallow Nest Export Strategies From Indonesia  To China With Export Restriction Regulations,"this research aims to provide information for indonesian swallow nest entrepreneurs who want to export to china, but do not understand how to comply with the restrictive regulations made by indonesia and china. this research uses a qualitative approach with the method used is a descriptive case study. the data collection technique used is semi- structured interviews with 5 informants, from the government association and exporting company. the informants were obtained using the linear snowball sampling technique. the data analysis technique used is the qualitative data analysis techniques using miles huberman approach. we show the current state of swallow nest exports after regulatory adaptation; 80% of swallow nest exports come from indonesia and china is the biggest consumer. we also explain about the impact of exporting legally and illegally. furthermore, we provide information about the real difficulties and opportunities facing indonesian swallow nest exporters, as well as what needs to be done to be successful exporters.","export, swallow nests, indonesia, china","The purpose of this research is to provide information for Indonesian swallow nest entrepreneurs who want to export to China, but do not understand how to comply with the restrictive regulations made by Indonesia and China. The limitations of this study are: This research focuses on exporting Indonesian swallow nests to China; Special regulations and qualifications that only apply in Indonesia; This regulation only applies as long as the regulation on Export Policy and Regulation by the ministry of trade, Regarding Animal Quarantine Measures For The Entry Or Exit Of Swallow's Nests To And From The Territory of The Unitary State of The Republic Of Indonesia, Regarding Certification of Veterinary Control Numbers for Animal Products Business Units by the ministry of agriculture, Decree of the Head of the Agricultural Quarantine Agency Regarding Guidelines for Requirements and Actions Animal Quarantine Against the Release of Swallow's Nests from the Territory of the State Republic of Indonesia to the People's Republic of China, Regarding Guidelines for Quarantine Monitoring of the Release of Swallow's Nests to the People's Republic of China, Regarding Guidelines Swallow's Nest Heating For Export To The People's Republic Of China, Regarding Guidelines for Examination of Nitrite Content Swallow's Nest for Export to The People's Republic of China, Regarding Verification Guidelines on Heating Swallow's Nests for Export to the People's Republic of China applies; and the number of informants is only a few, namely only 5 people. The lack of previous research that discusses regulations and export strategies for swallow nests. Previous studies have discussed a lot about the content of swallow's nests and the benefits of swallow's nests without being associated with the process and regulation of swallow's nest imports in export destination countries, especially in this case China. When examined in this study, the results obtained deepen insight and focus more on the export of Indonesian swiftlet nests to China as an export destination. Based on the analysis presented, it can conclude that Indonesia is the largest producer of swallow's nest in the world with China as the largest consumer of swallow's nest in the world. To be able to export Indonesian swallow nests to China, the company must be a registered exporter of swallow nests from the Ministry of Trade of the Republic of Indonesia and registered with the GACC (General Administration of Customs China). So far, only 23 companies have been able to export directly Indonesian swallow nests to China. Each of these companies has an export quota that adjusted to the company's capabilities. Swallow's nest that exported must be a clean swallow's nest with a maximum nitrite content of 30ppm. Business actors and the government hope for relief regarding this nitrite content, and currently the trade ministry is in negotiations with the Chinese side regarding the nitrite content to increase to a maximum of 80ppm. In all fields there must be those whom do it right or wrongly, this study also discusses the impact of legal and illegal export of swallow's nests. Exports of legal swallow's nests will bring many benefits for business actors, China provides very high prices for companies that have permits to export to their countries, China also has a very large demand for swallow's nests, and the high price also accompanied by quality and must comply with all existing regulations. Not only for business actors, this legal export also brings many benefits to the environment, government, and consumers. Meanwhile, illegal exports will have a dangerous impact that is very detrimental to the actors themselves, consumers, the environment, government, and industry, because it can have an impact on banning re-exports. Therefore, the illegal export of swallow's nests strictly prohibited because it violates Law number 21 of 2019 article 34. The main obstacle experienced by business actors in the process of exporting Indonesian swallow nests to China is at the registration stage at GACC because an audit will be carried out, it takes a lot of time and money to adjust to regulations. Other obstacles are related to forest fires, which can cause a reduction in raw materials, the number of people who do not know what a swallow's nest is and the name Indonesia which is not yet well known as the world's largest producer of swallow's nest. Meanwhile, the opportunity for Indonesia's bird's nest industry in the future is to have bargaining power to offer processed swallow's nest products so that not only clean swallow's nests are exported, this will bring more profits and more labor absorption. The swallow's nest industry still doesn't have many competitors in it, and Indonesia has abundant resources that can be used as well as possible while being wise in protecting the environment. The key to the successful export of Indonesian swallow nests to China is to follow existing regulations, attend training and assistance provided by the Indonesian government, be patient, have good relationships with regulators, continue to monitor the progress of the registration process, and have enthusiasm. If the company feels that it has not been able to meet the existing regulations, the company can export to non-China or sell locally, which is much easier to regulate, Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management Istanbul, Turkey, March 7-10, 2022 IEOM Society International 2663","dony saputra, prima feminita asihatka, and elena putri sutanto management department binus business school undergraduate program bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia dony.saputra@binus.ac.id, prima.asihatka@binus.ac.id, elena.sutanto@binus.ac.id","References

286,"Solar Infrastructure: Mbkm Village Community Service  Program, Narotama University, Surabaya, Indonesia,","this study aims to determine the involvement and benefits that can be obtained by students when participating in mbkm. the mkbm discussed was the mbkm village community service program, narotama university, in particular the mbkm program which contributes to renewable energy for better village environment. the research uses a quantitative approach. the populations in this study were all active narotama university students, which amounted to 1633 students. data was collected using a questionnaire. data analysis was performed using descriptive and crosstab analysis. crosstab is an analytical method that presents two different variables into one matrix. crosstab research shows tabulations that include rows and columns. the results showed that narotama university students had actively participated in the mbkm building a village activity. student interest in this program is high and students are willing to recommend the mbkm program to other fellow students. the mbkm activities that have been followed have been able to improve the competencies and skills needed by students later when they graduate and enter the world of work. this mbkm activity can be a solution to reduce the gap that exists between university graduates and industry needs.","renewable energy, solar power","The MBKM program at Narotama University Surabaya has involved eight departments, namely the management department, the law department, the civil engineering department, the accounting department, the information systems department, the information engineering department, and the early childhood education department. This study focuses on students who take part in the MBKM building a village program. The activities carried out in this program are various, one of which is the installation of a renewable energy system for a better village environment. The civil engineering study program students most participate in the building a village program compared to other study programs. Student interest in this program is high and students are willing to recommend the MBKM program to other fellow students. The MBKM activities that have been followed have been able to improve the competencies and skills needed by students later when they graduate and enter the world of work. This MBKM activity can be a solution to reduce the gap that exists between university graduates and industry needs. The suggestion that can be given is that Narotama University continues to improve MBKM activities, especially building a village. Many villages in Indonesia are still underdeveloped, and universities need intervention so that these villages can continue to develop and progress. Lecturers who join this program must also actively provide direction to students during the process so that the benefits that can be felt by students can be maximized.

301,A Study On Improving The Vaccination Process Of Local  Government Units (Lgu) In The National Capital Region Of,"this study determined the problems in the current covid-19 vaccination process in the national capital region (ncr) and proposed improvements to improve the current process. a survey questionnaire to gather information on vaccination experience was created using google forms and was deployed to 120 respondents. the current vaccination process was presented using a systems flowchart, while the problems observed in the process were evaluated using a stream diagnostic chart. findings showed that citizens experienced a delay during vaccination due to the inefficiencies of the online registration system, the first step in the current covid-19 vaccination process, and insufficient resources in the vaccination site. an improved covid-19 online registration system was designed to improve the registration process. this improved system will facilitate a more efficient vaccination process and provide more reliable information readily available for lgus. it is also recommended to increase the workforce available in the vaccination site to assist the citizens seeking the service. an integrated or unified vaccine registration and scheduling system may be studied and created in the future so that all lgus will have a single system to utilize for covid-19 vaccination. future researchers may use the findings in this study to conduct further studies related to the covid-19 vaccination process. other areas that may also be explored in the future include facility layout and design of the vaccine centers, simulation studies, and workforce allocation modeling.",,"This study aims to improve the current vaccination process of LGUs in the National Capital Region. The stream diagnostic chart identified that the primary root cause of the problem is the inefficiency of the current vaccine online registration process. The website is sometimes inaccessible due to an internal error, and individuals who registered online experience delays in receiving the text confirmation of the schedule. The delays forced individuals to walk in on vaccination sites in the hope of getting the vaccine. It is therefore recommended to improve the information system used by LGUs, especially for online registration. Allowing individuals to choose their preferred schedule and location of vaccination will be very helpful as this will prevent long waiting times and enable the individuals to get vaccinated at their most convenient time. Additionally, walk-ins, people cutting in line, delays, and disruption in the process may be prevented, and safety protocols such as social distancing may be properly executed. Improving the information system for online registration of COVID-19 vaccination will facilitate a more efficient vaccination process and provide much information readily available for LGUs. Future researchers may use this information in conducting further studies related to COVID-19 vaccination. Other areas not covered in this study may also be explored in the future, such as facility layout and design of the vaccine centers, simulation studies, and workforce allocation modeling.

302,Determining Newspaper Distribution Routes To Reduce  Environmental Emissions With Saving Matrix Method Based,"compared to other businesses, the newspaper industry has a unique distribution strategy that avoids stockpiling goods. this problem is similar to the vehicle routing problem in that it aims to find the best newspaper distribution route while considering future demand forecasts. demand forecasting using the linear regression approach, with a 5% annual increase in demand. the saving matrix approach with nearest insert, farthest insert, nearest neighbor, sweep, and greedy algorithms determines the ideal distribution path to reduce distribution costs. in the final results, we found routes 1, 2, and 3 to have a total distance of 74.5 km, 80.1 km, and 21 km, respectively. the operation of a fleet of trucks emits 15,992 tons of co2 per year into the atmosphere.","newspaper industry, demand forecasting","Three optimal newspaper distribution routes were obtained based on data processing regarding newspaper demand forecasting and vehicle routing problem solving. 3 These routes have been arranged in order so that the total distance traveled for route 1 is 74.5 km, route 2 is 80.1 km, and route 3 is 21 km with a total of 15.992 kilograms of carbon emissions produced from the three vehicles used per year. This article can be developed further by increasing the reachable agent data. XYZ Company script can use a proposal designed to determine the distribution route of newspapers to agents, but this research is not the most optimal. Also, this study only considers economic and environmental factors by calculating fuel consumption, has not considered social factors, and has not calculated the value of electricity consumption. Then in the future, the company can carry out sustainable development by using more environmentally friendly fuels to reduce the resulting carbon emissions. It would be better to consider social factors and calculate the value of electricity consumption to apply the concept of sustainable supply chain management.","on demand forecasting for green logistics tasya santi rahmawati, wulan istifarrosa, yuanita maharani tampubolon undergraduate program in industrial engineering department, faculty of engineering universitas sebelas maret surakarta, jl. ir. sutami, 36 a, surakarta, indonesia tasyasantir@student.uns.ac.id, wulistifarosa@student.uns.ac.id, yuanita_ma@student.uns.ac.id isna nugraha industrial engineering department, faculty of engineering universitas pembangunan nasional veteran jawa timur, surabaya, indonesia isna.nugraha.ti@upnjatim.ac.id wahyudi sutopo university centre of excellence for electrical energy storage technology universitas sebelas maret, surakarta, jl. ir. sutami, 36 a, surakarta, indonesia wahyudisutopo@staff.uns.ac.id yuniaristanto research group industrial engineering and techno-economic, industrial engineering department, faculty of engineering universitas sebelas maret, surakarta, jl. ir. sutami, 36 a, surakarta, indonesia yuniaristanto@ft.uns.ac.id",
303,Determining The Optimal Route For Newspaper Distribution  To Reduce Environmental Emissions For Green Logistics,"in the digitalization era, newspaper customers choose to access electronic news because it is received more quickly and does not require a lot of money to access the news. the newspaper industry requires an optimal distribution system with the shortest route to save transportation costs and speed up newspapers reaching customers. traffic density is a factor that can slow down the newspaper distribution process. there are emission factors from the distribution process and affect the air quality in the environment. the factors of traffic density and greenhouse gas emissions need to support the concept green distribution and green logistics at xyz ltd. surakarta. this study to provide proposed optimal distribution route by adjusting the level of traffic density and paying attention to greenhouse gas emission factors using saving matrix method and nearest neighbor method. the results of this study indicate the distribution route with a total distance of 28.6 km with a distribution time of 114 minutes. the company save 31.5 hours/month. with the optimal total mileage obtained, the company produces 2,3875 x 103 kg of co2/year and only spends idr 29,744.00/day for gasoline costs, where the emission results and operating costs are relatively low.","distribution route, nearest neighbor, saving matrix","Based on calculations using the saving matrix and the nearest neighbor method, total travel time to all agents is 1 hour 51 minutes, with this travel time the company can save 31.9 hours per month. Taking into account the average vehicle speed data, it is recommended to start distributing it at 03.00 WIB. In addition, with the optimal total mileage obtained, the company produces 2,3875 x 103 kg CO2 emissions in a year and only spend IDR 29,744.00 per day for gasoline costs, where the emission results and operating costs are quite low. In this study using a qualitative settlement method, the data used are long enough so that data updates are needed, especially on agent data, speed data or vehicle density data. In addition, this study only considers CO2 emissions factor because the limition of data due to pandemic situation, only considers economic and environmental factors by calculating fuel consumption, has not considered social factors and has not calculated the value of electricity consumption. Suggestions for future research would be better if taking data directly from the Solo Police in order to obtain accurate data on traffic density levels and can also consider to other emission factor, social factors and calculate the value of electricity consumption so that companies can apply the concept of sustainable supply chain management.","using the saving matrix and nearest neighbor methods case study: xyz ltd. surakarta annisa syahliantina, ainun rahmansyah gaffar undergraduate program in industrial engineering department, faculty of engineering universitas sebelas maret surakarta, jl. ir. sutami, 36 a, surakarta, indonesia annisasyahliantina@student.uns.ac.id, ainunrahmansyahgaffar@student.uns.ac.id isna nugraha industrial engineering department, faculty of engineering universitas pembangunan nasional veteran jawa timur, surabaya, indonesia isna.nugraha.ti@upnjatim.ac.id wahyudi sutopo, yuniaristanto university centre of excellence for electrical energy storage technology research group industrial engineering and techno-economic, industrial engineering department, faculty of engineering universitas sebelas maret, surakarta, jl. ir. sutami, 36 a, surakarta, indonesia wahyudisutopo@staff.uns.ac.id, yuniaristanto@ft.uns.ac.id",
304,Selection Of The Best Newspaper Forecasting Method Using  Holt-Winters And Long Short Term Memory Method,"as a result of digitalization, demand for newspapers has become more volatile and difficult to predict. this research aims to determine the best forecasting method with the smallest error value to reduce the company's rate of newspaper returns and losses. the holt-winter and long-short term memory approaches are used to analyze the data. in addition, the results of this research's forecasts were compared to the previous research that used the arima method and trend line analysis method. the forecasting method will be chosen based on the lowest mean absolute percentage error (mape) criteria. according to this research and the previous research, the mape value for the trend line analysis method is 2.94%, 3.52% for the arima method, 3.87% for long short-term memory; meanwhile, the holt-winter has the lowest error rate, with a mape value of 2%. in conclusion, the best forecasting method for forecasting newspaper demand at pt. xyz is the holt-winter method.","holt-winter, forecasting, newspaper industry","Based on the results of this research, the holt-winter method had an error rate of 2%, and the long short term memory method had an error rate of 3,6%. Then, previous research with the ARIMA method had an error rate of 3,52%, and trend line analysis had 2,94%. It can be seen that the optimal forecasting method is the holt-winter method because it has the lowest error rate of all the alternatives. So, the company can use the holt-winter forecasting method to predict the number of requests for newspapers in the future to reduce the rate of returns and losses experienced by the company. The limitation of this research is focused on forecasting the secondary data sourced from the previous research. However, the latest actual demand and sales data are not collected, so we cannot see the actual prediction. So, future research can be conducted by collecting the latest sales data and comparing the holt-winter method with other forecasting methods, especially using Machine Learning.

308,Enhancing The Effectivity And Efficiency Of Production  System Using Discrete Event Simulation Approach (A Case,"as a newspaper printing company, pt solo grafika utama has the responsibility to be agile and produce on time so that customers could read the newspaper with an updated news early. this could be done with the implementation of balancing the system of production, system of distribution, and also system of content creation. newspaper printing companies have several characteristics which are limited time of production, tight distribution schedule, and the unavailability of a warehouse. aligned with its characteristics, in the real-world case, pt solo grafika utama still faces some obstacles in balancing its system and operations, especially in its production system. in this study, discrete event simulation approach is used to find the most effective and efficient combination of machine, layout, and resource to achieve a highly effective and efficient system of production by reducing idle value. by analyzing previous research and the actual production layout of pt solo grafika utama, two solution scenarios were considered. using the flexsim software, the results show that the first scenario, “one line one operator” succeeded in reducing idle value and the second scenario, “one source one operator” also succeeded in reducing idle value from previous research out of the two proposed solution scenarios, the second scenario was chosen as the most effective and efficient system of production that can be implemented.","production system, effective, efficient","This study implements DES to solve problems in making newspapers based on previous research conducted by Riskadayanti in 2019. This study has a weakness because the data used still uses data from the previous paper, and the limitation in this study is that the parameters that are changed are only related to the jobdesk of the operator. Two scenarios are proposed in this study, “One Line One Operator” where one operator are handling one line of machine and responsible for providing all of raw materials (ink, paper, and plate) in that line of machine, while the other scenario is “One Source One Operator” where one operator is handling one raw material only (e.g. operator A is responsible for the ink) and also responsible for assigning the raw material to each printing machine and handling one counter machine. It was proven that both of the two solutions give a highly reduced idle value compared to the previous solution in the research by Riskadayanti (2019). This study shows the importance of the equal distribution of the operator’s task. We can conclude that by assigning the operator in the equal and proper task, the idle value will decrease. Based on the scenario that we have proposed, we suggest the company to use the proposed solution II which is the “One Source, One Operator” scenario with the consideration of the smallest average idle value among other scenarios with a value of 14.66%. We suggest further research to make changes and adjustments to the layout of the production process to reduce idle value.

309,Comparison Of Trend Line Analysis Methods And  Backpropagation Neural Network With Lowest Error Rate,"in today's digital era, many industries are affected by digitization. one of them is the newspaper industry which causes demand uncertainty and is difficult to predict. this causes a very high rate of return or newspaper returns which will result in losses for the company. therefore, it is necessary to use a newspaper demand forecasting method that has a low error rate. the method used is trend line analysis method and backpropagation neural network. the data used is actual demand data, sales results, sales prices and stock from january 2020 to january 2021. the calculation process uses microsoft excel and matlab. in addition, the selection of the best method is obtained by comparing the smallest mse value. based on the mse comparison, it was found that the forecasting method with the smallest error rate was the backpropagation artificial neural network method with an mse value of 0.0104 therefore, the best forecasting method for forecasting the demand for the number of newspapers pt. solopos script is a backpropagation method for artificial neural networks","backpropagation, newspaper, mse, forecasting","Based on the results of research on predicting the number of newspaper requests using 2 methods, namely the trend line analysis method and the backpropagation neural network method, it can be concluded that the best method is the method that produces the smallest MSE (Mean Square Error) value. The MSE value of the trend line analysis method is 4.21 while the MSE value of the backpropagation artificial neural network method is 0.0104. So it can be seen that the most suitable method used to forecast the number of newspaper requests is the backpropagation neural network method. The advantage of this paper is that it is able to prove that the bacpropagation neural network method has the lowest MAPE value. While the drawback of this paper is to use hypothetical data. So that further research is expected to use real data and try to compare it with other methods such as Support Vector Regression (SVR). The results of this study can be used by companies to carry out production planning so that later the rate of return or newspaper returns can be lower, and the company can reduce losses that occur.","in solopos newspaper industry alifah rahmadiyani, ferina ruby alfiyanti, muhammad dani setiawan industrial engineering, universitas sebelas maret, alifahrahmadiyani@student.uns.ac.id , ferinaruby@student.uns.ac.id , danisetiawan@student.uns.ac.id3 silvi istiqomah industrial engineering department, faculty of engineering universitas mahakarya asia, diy, indonesia silviistiqomah23@gmail.com wahyudi sutopo3, yuniaristanto4 3) university centre of excellence for electrical energy storage technology 4) research group industrial engineering and techno-economic, industrial engineering department, faculty of engineering universitas sebelas maret, surakarta, jl. ir. sutami, 36 a, surakarta, indonesia wahyudisutopo@staff.uns.ac.id, yuniaristanto@ft.uns.ac.id",

312,Distribution Route Optimization Of Newspaper Publishing  Company With Saving Matrix Method And Milk-Run System,"the rapidly growing communication technology brings not only an opportunity but also a challenge to the printing industry. consumers are significantly moving from conventional media to digital. determining the optimal distribution route to ensure a smooth distribution flow is crucial to retaining customers by providing an optimal service. one of the limitations in the distribution process is related to vehicle capacity (capacitated vehicle routing problem). previous research has succeeded in determining a combined route between three newspaper industry companies in surakarta, but each company still needs optimal independent routes. using the saving matrix method with the milk-run system, this study aims to determine the optimal route for distributing newspapers independently, focusing on one of the newspaper companies by considering three conditions: when demand increases, decreases, and is static. nearest insert and nearest neighbor methods are used to optimize the distribution route. the results show that each of the three conditions has two optimal routes. when the demand is static, the total monthly cost is idr 618,750. when the demand increases, the total cost per month will be idr 562,650, and when the demand decreases, the total cost per month will be idr 592,350/month.","distribution, saving matrix","Based on the latest conditions, namely the savings in distributing newspapers to customers with joint delivery planning, but not considering static, decrease, and increased demand conditions. While the improvement results from this research are the calculation of the state of demand, such as when the demand state is static, decrease and increase so that in each situation there are two optimal routes, each of which has been carried out data processing with the saving matrix method. The result of data processing using the saving matrix method with the nearest insert and nearest neighbor approaches, two optimal routes with three conditions are obtained to distribute Solopos newspapers. When the demand is static, the optimal distance on route 1 using the nearest insert approach is 15.2 km, with the distribution route, namely W-C1-C4-C7-C6-W, and the fuel cost is IDR 250,800/month. For route 2, using the nearest neighbor approach, the distance needed to be travelled is 22.3 km. The distribution route is W-C2-C3-C5-C9-C8-W, and the vehicle fuel cost is IDR 367,950/When the demand is static, the total cost per month is IDR 618,750/month. When demand increases, the total distance of route 1 with the nearest insert approach is 16.4 km. The distribution route will be W-C4-C5-C7-C6-G8-W, and the vehicle fuel cost is IDR 270,600/month. Route 2, using the nearest neighbor, will have a total distance of 17.7 km with the distribution route: W-C5-C3-C7-C6-W. The entire vehicle cost will be IDR 292,050/month.

Xyz),"the development of technology and information has a significant impact on society, both positively and negatively. digitalization has resulted in many people switching from printed newspapers to digital newspapers. this could lead to demand uncertainty in the newspaper industry. at pt.xyz, the number of newspapers produced and distributed to realtors often exceeds customer demand. in 2017, the company's return rate reached 5%. however, every january, march, and april where the chinese new year festival, dalang cilik festival, and world dance day are held, the demand will increase. this surge in demand, if not anticipated properly, can result in unfulfilled customer demands. for this reason, in this research, forecasting is carried out by considering special event factor using holt-winter's, decomposition, and exponential smoothing event-based method. to decide which method is the best, the mape value was used as criteria. the mape value for holt-winter's, decomposition, and exponential smoothing event- based method respectively are 0,92%, 1,05%, and 3%. based on the mape value for each method, it can be seen that the most effective forecasting method is holt's-winter method with a mape value of 0.92%.","decomposition, forecasting, holt-winter's","In this study, demand forecasting for Solopos newspapers was carried out by comparing the Holt-Winter's, Decomposition, and Exponential Smoothing Event-Based methods. The data used in this forecast is demand data for the Solopos newspaper from 2019-2021. To compare which method is the best for forecasting, an indicator in the form of the MAPE value is used. Based on the calculation results, the MAPE values for the Holt-Winter's, Decomposition, and Exponential Smoothing Event-Based methods are 0.92% each; 1.05%; and 3%. From the three methods, it can be seen that the Holt's-Winter method has the smallest MAPE value. With MAPE value of 0.92% which is the amount of error resulting from forecasting. The more accurate MAPE value is in the forecasting process (ingesting a value of 0). Therefore, it can be concluded that the Holt's-Winter method is the best method for forecasting Solopos newspaper demand. This method could be used by the company to forecast the newspaper's demand more accurately in order to reduce losses.","eka anasrul hakim, kyrie anggito munthe, shafa keysa rinjani hananta undergraduate program in industrial engineering department, faculty of engineering universitas sebelas maret surakarta, jl. ir. sutami, 36 a, surakarta, indonesia anasrulhakim19@student.uns.ac.id, kyrieanggitomunthe@student.uns.ac.id, shafakeysa3@student.uns.ac.id nida an khofiyah industrial engineering department, faculty of engineering pelita bangsa university, jl. inspeksi kalimalang tegal danas, cikarang, indonesia khofiyah.nidaan@gmail.com wahyudi sutopo university centre of excellence for electrical energy storage technology universitas sebelas maret, surakarta, jl. ir. sutami, 36 a, surakarta, indonesia wahyudisutopo@staff.uns.ac.id yuniaristanto research group industrial engineering and techno-economic, industrial engineering department, faculty of engineering universitas sebelas maret, surakarta, jl. ir. sutami, 36 a, surakarta, indonesia yuniaristanto@ft.uns.ac.id",
314,A Usability Study On The Online Retail Platform Of  Local Pharmacies In The Philippines,"technology advancements have also turned pharmacies in developing their digital strategies. the usability and user interface are vital to establishing a more robust end-to-end service with the customers. this study assessed the e- commerce platform of one of the leading pharmacies in the philippines. the assessment was made on the context of usability to determine whether the pharmacy's website contains the preferred features of the consumers. a total of 156 respondents evaluated the website of an online pharmacy through an online survey questionnaire. the study utilized the multiple regression analysis to determine which among the key features from the usability test based on neilsen's heuristics has a significant impact on the pharmaceutical website. the results showed that the critical elements of a pharmaceutical website are a user-friendly interface, simple and recognizable interface, prevention of errors, and ease of transaction. the findings of the evaluation specified that most of the users were not generally satisfied with the pharmacy's current website design because it was too complex and cannot be easily identified as a pharmaceutical e- commerce website. the study also proposes a new website design that has a simplified feature to identify and navigate the website easily and removal of unessential features including adjustment of the font colors and background. the improvement on the pharmacy’s website design will help attract more customers, build trust, and influence customer loyalty.","usability, such as buying","In the present generation, where technology is used in almost all aspects, it is no wonder that e-commerce pharmacies should strive to make a website with better end-to-end service and the best presentation of website interface for their potential customers. The study focused on assessing a pre-existent website created by one of the leading pharmaceutical companies in the Philippines. Usability testing, such as the application of Nielsen's Usability Heuristics, aids in evaluating the different features of a website and helps identify areas for improvement. Results obtained from the survey showed that most of the respondents were not generally satisfied with the pharmacy's current website design as they did not immediately know what the website was all about at first glance, led them to errors, and thought that there were features on the website that are not useful. Several areas that need improvement are the website's interface, which needs to be more user-friendly, simple, and recognizable, seldom presence of errors, and ease of transaction. Generally, the website needs to be vastly improved in terms of user-friendly graphic and layout design and focus on enabling customers to have an easy, stress-free transaction in buying the products they need. Identifying which features should be added or removed as they are not necessary to the transaction will help assure the customers a great experience with the pharmaceutical website. Improving the user interface with the consideration of any potential customer will benefit both the customers, whether they are new or not, and the business itself. The improvements will help attract more customers, build trust in the company, and influence customer loyalty. It is recommended for future researchers to expand the scope of this study and increase the number of respondents when conducting similar e-commerce website evaluations. It is also recommended to conduct further studies on website layout and design based on cognitive ergonomics application for pharmaceutical companies and other industries. Future researchers may also conduct usability studies that apply other theories or models not only on the pharmaceutical industry but on other consumer products.","michaella alyssa t. aquino, leonard rasell s. manlapas, ashley marie n. margate, piolo miguel b. rivera, and josephine d. german school of industrial engineering and engineering management mapúa university intramuros, manila, philippines mataquino@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, lrsmanlapas@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, amnmargate@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, pmrivera@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, jdgerman@mapua.edu.ph",
315,Implementation Of The Trend Line Analysis Method On  Newspaper Demand In The Digitalization Era: A Case Study,"the rapid development of communication and information technology has given birth to new digital-based media that have changed people's behavior in consuming mass media. consumers are significantly moving from conventional media to digital. print media lost readers drastically, especially from the young group. this had some negative effects on the demand for printed newspapers, with frequent supply-demand inaccuracies resulting in many newspapers being returned. for this reason, it is necessary to determine the method of forecasting the number of newspaper requests that has the smallest error rate so that it can help companies reduce losses due to newspaper returns. this study calculates demand forecasting using the trend line analysis method in three conditions, namely when demand decreases, increases, and is seasonal. furthermore, the three conditions are compared with the forecasting results. the selection of the forecasting method for the best conditions is done by comparing the error rate (mape) of each condition with the trend line analysis method, then the trend line analysis method is chosen under certain conditions with the smallest error rate. based on the comparisons made, it can be seen that the forecasting method that has the smallest error rate is the trend line analysis method with an uptrend with a mape value of 4.56%. therefore, the conditions that are suitable for using the trend analysis method are obtained, namely when demand increases or has an uptrend.","case study, demand forecasting, digitalization era, turkey","This study describes the condition of forecasting demand for newspapers using the trend line analysis method. Several data trend conditions are compared to what data conditions the trend line analysis method chooses an accurate forecast. From the analysis that has been carried out, the trend line analysis method for the downtrend has an error rate of 5.41%, the trend line analysis method for the downtrend has an error rate of 4.56%, and the trend line analysis method for seasonal trends has an error rate of 5.12%. It can be seen that the trend line method analysis is most suitable to be used for forecasting in condition if the trend is up/increasing. The results of this study can be used by companies to carry out production planning so that later the rate of return or newspaper returns can be lower, and the company can reduce losses that occur. The advantage of the trend line analysis method is that it is very easy to understand and use in forecasting calculations. The disadvantage of this method is that it requires a lot of data from the past. So the trend line analysis method is used by traders over a long period, such as weekly or monthly. The development of this research can be done by comparing the trend line analysis method in various conditions with other methods such as the censored regression method. The use of censored regression models helps to devise a policy with a better statistical underpinning. A censored regression allows a formal assessment of the impact of a specific service policy in terms of service level and the trade-off with respect to excess supply it generates. At the same time, it allows a more formal identification of the influences that are relevant in the forecasting system.

316,Determining Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem Model  With Comparative Analysis Of Sweep Algorithm And,"the main factors in achieving maximum company profits is the distribution of goods/products. optimal distribution means that the product is received by the consumer in the right quantity, in good condition, at the time promised and at a low cost. one example in the case of the newspaper industry, there is a problem related to determining vehicle routes that aim to minimize route distances and minimize transportation costs from distribution warehouses to consumers or what is commonly called the capacitated vehicle routing problem (cvrp). cvrp is related to determining the distribution channel of a product optimally. the purpose of this research is the formation of the capacitated vehicle routing problem model on the daily distribution route problem of pt. abc in the solo raya area by using a comparison between the sweep algorithm and the heuristic algorithm. the results of the study showed that the best method to solve cvrp problems at pt. abc is a heuristic algorithm with less distance traveled than the sweep algorithm method.","distribution route, newspaper company","PT. ABC script experienced distribution problems which could result in delays in delivery. This is because newspaper distribution is unique because it has time windows and the plan–make–deliver–return process in the newspaper industry only lasts less than one day or 24 hours. Research on distribution is carried out to solve distribution problems. The approach of the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem model on the problem of the daily distribution route of PT. ABC in the Solo Raya area is solved by using a comparison between the sweep algorithm and the heuristic algorithm. Based on the results of research that has been done in the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem by using a sweep algorithm calculation and heuristic algorithm. And with the support of data collection obtained from various sources, including by using the Google Maps application in determining the distribution path that will be chosen by the researcher. Then the optimal route chosen is the route based on the heuristic method, namely by producing 3 clusters of distribution lines with a total distance of 31.7 km. Suggestions for further research are to try to calculate the estimated travel time or travel length by considering several elements, including the level of congestion that may occur or the number of traffic lights along the way which may also affect the length/time of the trip.","heuristic algorithm in newspaper company: a case study naufal adi wibowo, rahma sabilah nurbi, alifyan arza undergraduate program in industrial engineering department, faculty of engineering universitas sebelas maret surakarta, jl. ir. sutami, 36 a, surakarta, indonesia naufal_adi455@student.uns.ac.id, sabilahnurbi_19@student.uns.ac.id, alifyanarza@student.uns.ac.id nida an khofiyah industrial engineering department, faculty of engineering pelita bangsa university, jl. inspeksi kalimalang tegal danas, cikarang, indonesia khofiyah.nidaan@gmail.com wahyudi sutopo university centre of excellence for electrical energy storage technology universitas sebelas maret, surakarta, jl. ir. sutami, 36 a, surakarta, indonesia wahyudisutopo@staff.uns.ac.id yuniaristanto research group industrial engineering and techno-economic, industrial engineering department, faculty of engineering universitas sebelas maret, surakarta, jl. ir. sutami, 36 a, surakarta, indonesia wahyudisutopo@staff.uns.ac.id, yuniaristanto@ft.uns.ac.id",
317,Determination Of Distribution Routes With Joint Route  Planning Using Differential Evolution Algorithm In The,"the newspaper industry has different policies from other industries, especially in the distribution process. this is because there is a time limit for sending newspapers so that the information that reaches customers remains up-to- date. the process of distributing newspapers has determined the number of requests and several destination agents scattered in several areas, so the problem of newspaper distribution is categorized in the vehicle routing problem with time windows (vrptw). the purpose of this study is to obtain the shortest route and minimal distribution costs based on demand data and agent coordinate data that have been determined and the assumptions used by researchers. determination of the optimal route is done by using the de (differential evolution) algorithm with shipping plans with other newspaper industries (joint delivery). the results of the calculation of route distance, travel time and distribution costs will be compared with the current initial conditions. based on the results of calculations using the de algorithm, obtained a total distance of 142,95 km with a travel time of 2 hours 51 minutes and a total distribution cost of idr 45.565. with joint delivery planning, savings of 53,62% in terms of distribution costs are obtained.","newspaper industry, distribution, vrptw, de algorithm","Based on the results of data processing that has been carried out, the results obtained in the form of 24 stain pins with pin 1 as the depot.

Solving Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) using the DE (Differential Evolution) algorithm, the results obtained using 2 fleets, all requests can be fulfilled and the total travel time does not exceed the time windows or the maximum time limit for distributing newspapers is 3 hours 8 minutes with a distance of 157.15km. The capacity used in the first fleet is 5992 copies with a range of 15 agents, while the second fleet with a capacity of 2618 copies includes 8 agents. In the suggestion condition (joint route) the distance traveled is 157.15 km if the daily distribution cost is IDR 50,092 per day for fuel costs. The cost savings that occur by implementing the joint route as suggestion in this paper is 49.01% of the initial distribution costs each year. Suggestions for further research are expected to take into account the uncertainty of both demand, traffic speed and so on.","newspaper industry aldi pascagama nurracman, muhammad ilman zidni, rosifa sahara prasiwi undergraduate program in industrial engineering department, faculty of engineering universitas sebelas maret surakarta, jl. ir. sutami, 36 a, surakarta, indonesia pasca@student.uns.ac.id, ilmanzidni@student.uns.ac.id, rosifasp@student.uns.ac.id virda hersy lutviana saputri industrial engineering department faculty of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics universitas mahakarya asia yogyakarta 55285, indonesia virdahersylutvianasaputri@unmaha.ac.id wahyudi sutopo, yuniaristanto university centre of excellence for electrical energy storage technology research group industrial engineering and techno-economic, industrial engineering department, faculty of engineering universitas sebelas maret, surakarta, jl. ir. sutami, 36 a, surakarta, indonesia wahyudisutopo@staff.uns.ac.id, yuniaristanto@ft.uns.ac.id",
318,Supply Chain Network Model Development For Conversion  Electric Motorcycle Distribution In Central Java Using The,"an increase in the number of internal combustion engine (ice) motorcycles will have an impact on increasing carbon emissions in indonesia. one solution is to convert an ice motorcycle into a convertible electric motorcycle. this paper will explain the supply chain costs of a convertible electric motorcycle center in terms of manufacturers by develops a mathematical model to make a decision of an electric motorcycle conversion kit manufacturer opening with the mixed integer linear programming (milp) model. this paper also considers aspects of economic, social, and environmental sustainability as additional points of view in decision making. the results show that the model can be a decision-making tool for opening a motorcycle conversion kit manufacturer with more optimal results. the npv value > 0 indicates that the investment that will be carried out can be projected to bring profits to the company with a return on investment of 231.33%. then, with the reduction of carbon gas emissions by 0.98%, it is expected to improve public health and reduce mortality by 0.08% and increase life expectancy by 0.09%.",,"This research has succeeded in developing a supply chain network distribution system model for stakeholders. For manufacturers, this model can help make decisions in determining the investment in establishing an electric motorcycle conversion kit factory. For the government, this model can evaluate tax incentive policies so that they can attract investors to invest in the electric motorcycle conversion development sector. For consumers, with optimal costs from the producer side, it can reduce the selling price so that consumers get an efficient selling price but producers also still get the appropriate profit. This research succeeded in developing a mathematical model as a tool to formulate a distribution system policy for the supply chain network of convertible electric motorcycles. From the results of the mathematical model, it is obtained the decision to establish an electric motorcycle conversion kit factory, the number of conversion kits that must be produced, the number of warehouses and the location of the warehouse to be established, the number of conversion kits sent to each warehouse and each conversion workshop. In the next supply chain model development, it is necessary to develop a model that can measure the three aspects of sustainability simultaneously so that it can provide better results. In addition, it is necessary to develop a dynamic system simulation model taking into account the raw material tax and income tax to see the resilience of the electric motorcycle conversion project so that it can provide additional information on how long the conversion project can be carried out.

319,Supply Chain Risk Management In Newspaper Printing  Using Fmea And Fta Methods: A Case Study,"in the newspaper supply chain, the printing process, the procurement of paper, ink, and printing plates to the distribution of newspapers to consumers are the main business processes. the risk involved in the supply chain of the newspaper industry is particularly large. supply chain risk management is used to identify and mitigate the negative impacts of supply chain performance. this study aims to identify operational risks in the newspaper supply chain using the failure mode and effect analysis (fmea) and fault tree analysis (fta) methods and create alternative mitigation strategies. risk measurement in fmea is done by using a risk matrix, namely the risk priority number (rpn). as a result, 27 operational risks have the potential to disrupt the newspaper printing process, with critical risks occurring in the newspaper delivery process. then identify the factors causing the critical risk from the top event to the root cause of the risk (basic event). the results received are the causes of risk in the form of error splicing, unstable roller, inaccurate plate, unpredictable weather, lack of worker skills, pests and diseases, purchase forecast error, old transport, and traffic jam.","failure mode, risk priority, number","Based on the results and analysis, it can be concluded that there are 27 operational risks have potential to disrupt the supply chain of newspaper printing. These include 5 risks in the process plan, 6 risks in the source process, 9 risks in the make process, 4 risks in the delivering process, and 3 risks in the return process. The highest risk with a value of RPN 100 occurs in the delivering process, namely delays in newspaper delivery. Then análysis of risk causes include the machine stopped operating during the production process, failure from the customer, failure of inventory control, and disaster during delivery process. This event is used as a top event. While the basic event obtained is error splicing, unstable roller, inaccurate plate, unpredictable weather, lack of worker skills, pests and diseases, purchasing forecast errors, old transportation, and traffic jam. Furthermore, each basic event is given risk mitigation so that the supply chain in newspaper printing runs well. This study has not counting the risk cost so it is expected that future research can consider the cost.","aqshal raffa sandito, dina nurfitri rahma, niken utami tyastuti undergraduate program in industrial engineering department, faculty of engineering universitas sebelas maret surakarta, jl. ir. sutami, 36 a, surakarta, indonesia aqshalraffasandito@student.uns.ac.id, dinanrftr@student.uns.ac.id, nikenutami56@student.uns.ac.id arinda soraya putri industrial engineering department, faculty of engineering universitas muhammadiyah surakarta, jl. ahmad yani tromol pos 1, surakarta, indonesia asp835@ums.ac.id wahyudi sutopo, yuniaristanto 5) university centre of excellence for electrical energy storage technology 6) research group industrial engineering and techno-economic, industrial engineering department, faculty of engineering universitas sebelas maret, surakarta, jl. ir. sutami, 36 a, surakarta, indonesia wahyudisutopo@staff.uns.ac.id, yuniaristanto@ft.uns.ac.id",
320,A Manufacturer Opening Decision Of Electric Motorcycle  Conversion Kit Using The Mixed Integer Linear,"most people are now concerned about environmental issues. as the number of motorized vehicles grows, so does the consumption of fossil fuels. as a result, co2 levels in the atmosphere rise. starting to use alternate energy sources, such as electric automobiles, is one approach that can be implemented. by replacing the engine parts with a conversion kit, conventional motorcycles can be converted to electric motorcycles. in this study, the model is being developed by adding parameters. the cost of ordering raw supplies, storage expenses, transportation costs, and tax benefits are all factored into data processing. by using a mixed integer linear programming (milp) model, this research offers a mathematical model for deciding which electric motorcycle conversion kit business to open. the results demonstrate that the model can be used as a decision-making tool for starting an electric motorbike conversion kit manufacturer due to tax reductions, and then starting as a manufacturer is more effective than becoming a trader.","electric vehicle, facility location","This study aims to develop a mathematical model for making decisions about the opening of an electric motorcycle conversion kit manufacturer using the mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model. The inputs of this model are manufacturing investment costs, fixed manufacturing operational costs, raw material costs (imported and local), variable costs of production, tax percentages, tax incentives, transportation costs, and the demand for each workshop. The input constraint in this model is the manufacturing production capacity and the maximum number of manufactures that can be opened. This model is able to produce outputs in the form of manufacturing opening decisions, the number of conversion kits produced and the number of conversion kits sent from the manufacturer to the workshop. With these outputs, it can help for decision making to determine whether the conversion kit manufacture is worth opening or not. Based on the developed model, it was found that conversion kit manufacturers should be opened up and made into conversion kit assembly manufacturers rather than just being traders. This has an effect on the tax reduction effect. The limitation of this study is that it has not yet produced a simultaneous model to measure the 3 aspects of sustainability to provide better results. Researchers have considered the impact of reducing carbon emissions, so that companies can apply the concept of sustainable supply chain management in order to open conversion kit manufacturing.","programming method tasya santi rahmawati undergraduate program in industrial engineering department, faculty of engineering universitas sebelas maret surakarta, jl. ir. sutami, 36 a, surakarta, indonesia tasyasantir@student.uns.ac.id silvi istiqomah industrial engineering department, faculty of engineering universitas mahakarya asia, yogyakarta, indonesia silviistiqomah23@gmail.com wahyudi sutopo3, yuniaristanto4 3) university centre of excellence for electrical energy storage technology 4) research group industrial engineering and techno-economic, industrial engineering department, faculty of engineering universitas sebelas maret, surakarta, jl. ir. sutami, 36 a, surakarta, indonesia wahyudisutopo@staff.uns.ac.id, yuniaristanto@ft.uns.ac.id",
321,Development Of Location-Allocation Model Of Network  Design For Battery Swapping Station And Battery Charging,"electric vehicles have been shown to lessen air pollution caused by transportation. however, because the number of motorcycle riders in indonesia is fairly big, and because becak was once a major mode of transportation in indonesia, the usage of electric vehicles such as e-motorcycles and e-trikes is an interesting object to develop. a good establishment of battery recharging facilities can accelerate the use of electric vehicles. hence, planning for the establishment of a network of battery recharging facilities needs to be done. this study proposes a network design model for the battery charging station and battery swapping station facilities in surakarta city to achieve maximum coverage with minimum cost. market and mall locations in surakarta city are potential locations to be chosen as battery charging stations and battery swapping stations. the milp model is run using lingo to reach the optimal solution. the results of this study succeeded in determining the location of the battery charging station and the battery swapping station in markets and malls in surakarta with an investment feasibility study. this research is expected to provide input to solo technopark and the surakarta government in accelerating the use of electric vehicles.","electric vehicle, facility location","This study was able to find a solution for determining the location-allocation of two types of battery recharging stations to meet the demand. This study has also considered the costs that will be minimized by using a mathematical model to determine the location-allocation of battery recharging station facilities. The results of the optimization of the mathematical model determine the total number of battery recharging stations are 30 stations consisting of 13 battery charging stations (BCS) and 17 battery swapping stations (BSS). In addition, to get a positive NPV and ROI with a payback period of fewer than 10 years, battery charging station in the traditional market can be subsidized by 75% for equipment installation, as well as a land rental with an operating time of 10 hours. For battery charging station facilities at the mall, a 75% subsidy can be provided for installation and land rental with an operational time of 12 hours. Meanwhile, battery swapping station facilities in traditional markets and malls do not require subsidies to get positive NPV, and ROI with PP less than 10 years. In addition, this research can assist investment decision-making by analyzing investment feasibility using Break-Even Point (BEP) analysis, Net Present Value (NPV), Return on Investment (ROI), and Payback period analysis (PP). So that manufacturers or investors can have decision-making assistance to establish battery recharging station facilities.

331,An Evaluation On The Service Delivery Capacity Of  Engineering Educators From Selected Universities In The,"the impact of the covid-19 pandemic has undeniably affected the higher education sector, pushing higher education institutions to adapt to an abrupt online learning format. engineering programs are some of those struggling to mitigate the pandemic’s negative effects on the quality of education. this study evaluated the service delivery capacity of engineering educators from selected universities in the national capital region, philippines by measuring three main independent variables; namely, ict tools and platforms, training, and perception. the study also identified learning management systems and virtual laboratory software being used by respondents, and their take on the advantages and disadvantages of virtual laboratories in online engineering education. results of this study showed that the training program is the most significant independent variable in the overall service delivery capacity of engineering educators. institutions have acknowledged the challenges that their faculty members are facing with regards to online teaching and have provided sufficient and appropriate training programs to equip them in the shift to online teaching. thus, the service delivery capacity of the engineering educators was enhanced during the online setup.",engineering,"This study was able to deduced that the Training Program is the most significant variable for the service delivery capacity of Engineering Educators. It is evident that training programs for educators are a vital approach in maintaining good quality education in an online setting. Institutions must invest in training programs that would give Engineering educators the necessary skills, tools, and knowledge needed in an online setup. Furthermore, although virtual laboratories have great potential and advantages, there is still much to learn and improve in implementing these effectively. Although some software can function the same as actual equipment, there are still courses that cannot replace hands-on experience. Both physical and virtual have advantages, and this can be seen as room for improvement in our educational setting. Access to better resources, enhanced course design, better budget, and more research must be garnered in order for virtual laboratories to become more promising in the future. The results of this study paves way for more opportunities and discussions since training programs for faculty members in an online setup during the pandemic have not been explored as much in the related literature, especially in the local context. Virtual laboratories and ICT Tools and Platforms fit for Engineering are also not explored as much in the local context, which can be viewed as potential for further advancement in the educational setting and room for improvement for HEIs, especially in the Philippines.","national capital region, during the covid-19 pandemic vien ericka d. medina, marie nanz s. bacani, iane xavier e. go, kimberly e. cruz, joehanna k. ngo, ardvin kester s. ong department of industrial engineering, faculty of engineering university of santo tomas españa blvd., metro manila, philippines vienericka.medina.eng@ust.edu.ph, marienanz.bacani.eng@ust.edu.ph, ianexavier.go.eng@ust.edu.ph, kimberly.cruz.eng@ust.edu.ph, jkngo@ust.edu.ph, asong@ust.edu.ph ardvin kester s. ong school of industrial engineering and engineering management mapúa university, manila, philippines 658 muralla st., intramuros, manila 1002, philippines aksong@mapua.edu.ph",
332,Stakeholder Perspective Analysis: Factors For Sustainable  Policy Development,"sustainable development requires to identify and assess needs of all relevant stakeholders. for a construction industry stakeholder needs assessment is crucial as it is basis for long term development, as it is providing all infrastructure, while a construction project themselves are short term in long term planning perspective. stakeholder needs assessment in the construction industry is a challenging aspect due the various stakeholder group time and needs perspective including wide time offset, what would have to be considered in policy development. governance bodies define regulative norms for project planners and developers and project have to comply as direct requirements. regulative norms and requirements would have to define norms long term perspective, while project focus is primarily short term due to the project nature. problem: construction governance and planning requires assessment of all relevant stakeholder needs, but due to the construction industry specifics, there are challenges to extract and reflect all relevant stakeholder needs. purpose of current research is to identify policy development aspects for relevant stakeholder identification and need assessment for governance policy developers. main results: stakeholder identification aspects for planning analysis were identified. conclusions: sustainable development policy has to reflect long term needs, representing the interests of the non-stakeholder groups.","circular economy, governance, lca, stakeholders","Literature overview gave basis for synthesis of proposed stakeholder factor analysis model. Literature researched provided an overview on stakeholder analysis focused urban planning. During research it was identified that terms and keywords used for search of literature sources are leading to version scientific domains. Therefore, authors were doing iterations to select articles with specifics. Two main approaches were identified - project oriented and overall policy or general approach. There was a gap identified as project-oriented approach is primarily related to short term perspective due to the project nature, while policies are elements of long-term planning. Using synthesis approach linking aspects were identified as basis of model. The term “relevant” was found as a potential risk to miss significant stakeholder groups, possibly by deeming them “non-relevant” or with low relevance. Some relevant stakeholder groups are outside direct stakeholder analysis of a project and have to be reflected in relevant governance policies due to the time offset. Problematic aspects of correct stakeholder identification factor also lead to recognition of time horizon recognition for decision impact analysis. Analysis of model dynamics represents impact assessment within defined boundaries and condition. For overall aspects on stakeholder and policy planning, identifying long term stakeholder needs and including them in governance policies is critical for sustainable development as project level focuses on short term planning. Sustainable development policy has to reflect long term needs, representing the interests of “Non-Stakeholder” groups, which is not focus of project level planning. Policy makers, while developing policies, have to assess both short term (can be identified as project representing business) and long term (sustainability, society) aspects to comply with the interests of main stakeholder groups for overall sustainable development. Problematic aspects of stakeholder identification are closely related with interests of particular stakeholder groups. Different stakeholder groups have conflicting interests (social and sustainability versus profitability), thus in same situation a decision might require analysis of decision impact as conflict level or tradeoff of interests to balance interests of different stakeholder groups. A critical point for application of analysis is to assess importance of selected categories, as this might directly impact selected alternatives supported with decisions. Policies defined and/or known to become into force can be considered as infrastructure level for construction project planning along the technical landscape for project requirements.

By using the flower pollination algorithm method, it can be concluded that initially the uncovered area was 19,912m2, after optimization and new points were obtained for the four solar-powered pest control technologies, resulting in an uncovered area of 8599m2. With this comparison of placement locations, it is hoped that the facility in the form of solar-powered midges technology can function efficiently by looking at the installation location and reach of the tool, so that when this tool is to be implemented elsewhere, the party who will install this solar-powered midges technology can predict how much the appropriate amount for the area and where the location of the installation is effective and can reach all areas.","effectiveness of rojolele rice in delanggu gilang titah ramadhan master program of industrial engineering department, faculty of engineering universitas sebelas maret surakarta, indonesia gilangtr@student.uns.ac.id wahyudi sutopo university centre of excellence for electrical energy storage technology research group industrial engineering and techno-economic, industrial engineering department, faculty of engineering, universitas sebelas maret, jl. ir. sutami, 36 a, surakarta, indonesia wahyudisutopo@staff.uns.ac.id muhammad hisjam laboratory of logistics system and business, department of industrial engineering, faculty of engineering, universitas sebelas maret, surakarta, indonesia hisjam@staff.uns.ac.id bobby kurniawan laboratory of mechatronics and system modeling department of industrial engineering, university of sultan ageng tirtayasa b.kurniawan@untirta.ac.id",
337,Supply Chain Network Design Integration Model For  Opening-Closing Decision Allocation Terminal Salt,"pati regency is one of the leading producers of raw salt in indonesia and still have some potential in the future. however, the salt quality did not fulfill the specifications, resulting an unstable demand for the material stock. causing raw salt prices to fluctuate greatly, allowing salt farmers in pati to get little compensation. various breakthroughs that can give greater incentives to salt producers by enhancing their quality must be sought. this case study discusses how to use optimal terminal facility allocation, as well as decisions on opening and shutting terminal facilities. to maximize the advantage of all stakeholders, the linear programming approach is utilized to connect supply chain network design with warehouse receipt systems. the findings show that utilizing the model that was used, the decision was made to keep terminal 1 open.","optimization, facility location","The objectives of this paper is to construct a model that has been used in earlier studies to allocate warehouses/terminals with Supply Chain Network Design utilizing the Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) method (SCND). Following the development of the model, it was decided to maintain terminal 1 open while closing terminals 2,3, and 4. It could also be due to the high cost of building a single terminal/warehouse, therefore it's possible that opening a single terminal would be more beneficial, even if salt farmers can produce more, it's also because demand is relatively decreasing with each passing period. This decision indicates that having a terminal warehouse is beneficial and helpful to all parties involved. This is due to the high cost of opening and/or shutting warehouses, which makes the government as the warehouse provider incur losses if more warehouses are opened or closed. Thus, all party benefits and the price of the commodity will be less volatile, and the quality of the salt will be assured due to the warehouse receipt system. It is believed that this research would assist the government in making judgments on whether or not to close warehouses that have been shown to be ineffective. Salt farmers can also benefit from improved prosperity, which was formerly hampered by the variable salt selling price.

350,"Push-Pull-Mooring, Perceived Risk And Consumer Mobility:  Shaping E-Loyalty Behavior In Online Grocery Shopping","this paper draws a model based on push, pull and mooring (ppm) framework which acts as drivers of consumer e- loyalty in the context of online grocery shopping. the theoretical framework describes the potential influences of push, pull, and mooring on consumer e-loyalty intention. taking covid-19 pandemic era as the context of the study, consumer mobility and perceived risk are relevant to be added, considering the large scale restriction in the society . this is a descriptive research that measures individual’s perceptions to understand the influence of ppm components toward their e-loyalty behaviour. the unit of analysis in this study is individual purchasing groceries through online platform. data collection used convenience sampling. pre-test on 30 respondents was done to test reliability and validity of measurement item. another 218 usable responses were analysed using multiple regression to test the hypothesis. potential influences of perceived risk and consumer mobility towards the relationship of push, pull and mooring framework will also be demonstrated in the framework. the finding shows that the component of push (technical excellence), pull (word of mouth), and mooring (past switching behavior) are significantly influencing grocery shoppers’ e-loyalty. however, we cannot find support on the effect of customer services, excellence in delivered products, price perception (push components), alternative attraction (pull component), and low switching cost toward e-loyalty behaviour. meanwhile, the moderating effect of perceived risk and limited consumer mobility in pandemic area is evident in all linkages of push, pull and mooring components towards behavioural e-loyalty. this research fills the gap of the e-loyalty drivers by not only taking the ppm framework, but also specific aspects to large scale restriction during pandemic era; that is consumer mobility and perceived risk. this research sheds light to the understanding of how to maintain the e-loyalty of the consumers in the uncertainty period of the pandemic.","push, pull and mooring, online shopping, consumer mobility","This research shows that technical excellence, word of mouth, and past switching behaviour are crucial factors in generating behavioural e-loyalty in online grocery shopping. Online grocery retailers should keep maintaining technical excellence and quality, which will boost satisfaction and retain grocery shoppers using the online platform. This is important because technical issues likely influence shoppers to prefer on-site grocery shopping when the situation allows. Businesses operating online should also focus on word-of-mouth marketing as it is considered an essential factor in creating loyalty towards online platform usage. The research also found that a shopper's past switching behaviour will affect their loyalty. During the pandemic, shoppers who frequently switch grocery retailers will likely switch back and be disloyal in online shopping. Thus retailers operating online should create retention programs and loyalty benefits to prevent shoppers with a high tendency of switching to churning to other channels. During the pandemic, online grocery retailers and businesses can enjoy the advantage of high perceived risk and limited consumer mobility, as these factors strengthen the PPM component in creating behavioural e-loyalty.","during large scale restriction in covid-19 pandemic era evi rinawati simanjuntak faculty member in masters management program binus business school bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia esimanjuntak@binus.edu matthew abyra alumni of business management and marketing program binus business school bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia matthewabyra@gmail.com","references of online buyers and browsers differ on the design and content of

This study concludes that educational attainment is an identified factor that has the strongest and significant influence on safety comprehension, , that higher education is a strong influence on the safety comprehension at the workplace. On the other hand, regardless of position level, work experience and age it has no direct influence on comprehension score. The recommendation is to focus on resources of safety awareness and prioritize training more on workers concerning their level of educational attainment and work experiences. They were a group of workers that is at high risk of being involved in an accident in the workplace, and it is essential to give special attention to this group. Also, it further strengthens the theory that ergonomic principles improve the warning sign symbols comprehension, including the manufacturing industry. It is of high importance to design warning sign that is actively compliant to ergonomic design principles, and this study was able to successfully redesign a new set of warning sign that fails the initial comprehension level evaluation.","pablo b. mancia jr. and rex aurelius c. robielos school of graduate studies mapua university intramuros, manila, philippines pablomancia1030@gmail.com, racrobielos@yahoo.com",

time, and not considering them to be collected and scrutinized will lead to inaccuracy for future work of this study. 
Also, knowing the positive results of this study, it could be excellent to verify and validate the proposed system’s 
existing capabilities by applying it to other school departments of the university. Thus, this can be a stepping stone to 
finding the general model of the university’s examination timetabling problem, contributing to the body of knowledge 
since it is not yet well-defined globally. 
 
Furthermore, the researchers suggest a Student System Interface be added to the functionality scope of the proposed 
system because students are one of the key stakeholders in the examination scheduling process. Applying it creates a 
portal that eases and centralizes access to the published examination schedules for the students. On the other hand, a 
mobile application could also be developed and integrated with the proposed system to enhance its portability. 
The mobile application should initially cover the following for each system interface:  
 
• 
System Administrator: Viewing and exporting data reports, examination schedules, and chat system 
for preference discussion. 
• 
Proctor: Viewing proctoring schedules, setting schedule preferences for a particular examination 
event, and chat system for preference discussion. 
• 
Student: Viewing of examination schedules and course conflicts. 
 
All system interfaces of the mobile application should also have a built-in reminder/notification system and, for 
account security, a login system. In addition, applying miscellaneous logic for the automatic proctor scheduler to 
consider allocating the proctors to their teaching class could also be beneficial since this is one of the optional 
suggestions of the business clients. Significantly, the researchers assert that these enhancements will provide high 
satisfaction and positive innovation to the mentioned school department.

356,Food Company Manager'S Perspective   For Food Safety And Halal : Exploratory Study,"food safety and halal food is important aspect of the food industry. food safety affects health and food security while halal food complements islamic law. in the last few years, in various countries, there have been many cases that indicated a lack of awareness when implementing food safety and halal food in food processing companies which in company losses. the purpose of this study is to determine the manager's perspective regarding awareness and implementation of food safety and halal food related to company performance. case studies were conducted on two food processing companies using a semi-structural questionnaire method. the results of this study indicate that both companies have a high awareness of aspects of food safety and halal food. food safety implementation is carried out based on international standards (haccp, gmp, and iso 22000). halal food implementation is carried out according to the national standard (halal assurance system). although there are differences in priorities between the two companies regarding food safety and halal, both companies will say that food safety and halal affect performance.","food industry, food safety, halal food, firm performance","In this study, both food processing companies are aware of food safety and halal food aspects. This awareness is shown by the food safety and halal food certification, which influence the frequency of food safety and halal food incidents. Food safety and halal food aspects implementation is also supported by the company’s internal factors. The use of technology serves as an aspect leading to differences in these two cases. It was found that the use of technology is helpful to minimize food safety incidents. Food processing companies in this study view food safety and halal food awareness and implementation as important aspects that significantly affect the company’s operation, financial, and market performance. It is necessary to have a performance indicator that represents the success of food safety and halal food when measuring the company performance. Future studies are recommended to identify the performance measurement indicator in food processing companies regarding food safety and halal food using literature review, Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management Istanbul, Turkey, March 7-10, 2022 IEOM Society International 3356","melati kurniawati1,2 1department of industrial and systems engineering institut teknologi sepuluh nopember (its) surabaya, indonesia 2department of industrial engineering institut teknologi nasional bandung (itenas) bandung, indonesia melati@itenas.ac.id patdono suwignjo1, iwan vanany1, bambang syairudin1 1department of industrial and systems engineering institut teknologi sepuluh nopember (its) surabaya, indonesia psuwignjo@yahoo.com, vanany@ie.its.ac.id, bambangsyairudin@gmail.com","References

357,Online Learning Experience Of Malaysian University  Students During Covid-19 Pandemic,"the covid-19 pandemic has changed traditional teaching and learning worldwide to an online platform that includes lab activities and event mobility programs. thus, it is vital to investigate the online learners' performance during the new norms period. both public and private university students in malaysia comprising 403 respondents took part in this study. the frequencies and percentages were used to analyze the data. the findings indicated that the students’ performance in online learning was at a low level (mean = 2.96) which included student’s technical competencies (mean = 2.94), social competencies with the instructor (mean = 2.98), social competencies with classmates (mean = 2.97), and communication competencies (mean = 2.96). overall, the findings pointed out that the student's performance during the virtual space was at an average level.","turkey, march 7-10","The study revealed that the performance of student competencies during online academic activities was at average level. Considering the fact that nowadyas online learning has been a main medium in teaching and learning therefore, the readiness among lecturers or instructors and students need to be paid more attention. For the sake to boost student motivation and encourage them to take part actively during academic session, the diverse platform of learning need to be implemented. More hands-on projects can be divided among students so that they can explore by themselves effectively. According to the findings, technical competencies, social competencies with instructors, social competencies with classmates, and communication competencies at the higher education should be improved. University educators should hold seminars and employ a variety of instruments, as well as analyze the didactical principles of university education, in order to assist students in enhancing their skills. However, it was the role of the student to take an active role in the learning process by sharing ideas, reacting to colleagues, and expressing their thoughts and opinions through online learning.","khairunesa isa senior lecturer of social science center for general studies and curriculum universiti tun hussein onn malaysia johor, malaysia nesa@uthm.edu.my sarala thulasi palpanadan senior lecturer of language studies, centre for language studies universiti tun hussein onn malaysia johor, malaysia sarala@uthm.edu.my nurliyana md rosni research assistance of social science center for general studies and curriculum universiti tun hussein onn malaysia johor, malaysia n.liyanarosni@gmail nor shela saleh jabatan sains sosial universiti tun hussein onn malaysia 86400, parit raja, batu pahat, johor, malaysia norshela@uthm.edu.my mohd shafie rosli school of education, 81310 universiti teknologi malaysia shafierosli@utm.my",
358,Building The Model For Detecting Different Types Of  Accounting Fraud In Japanese Companies,"accounting fraud is defined as ""the intentional material misstatement of financial statements and financial disclosures (notes to financial statements and filings with the u.s. securities and exchange commission (sec)) and the commission of illegal acts that have a material direct impact on financial statements and financial disclosures"" (beasley et al. 2010, p.5). the impact is not limited to stakeholders, but is a problem that reduces the credibility of the financial reporting process itself. in response to accounting fraud, previous research has constructed models to detect companies engaging in accounting fraud using data obtained from financial statements, descriptions in reports such as form 10-k, and data on the financial market (beneish 1999; dechow et al. 2011; perols 2011; purda and skillicorn 2015, etc.). dechow et al. (2011) variableized the factors that influence the occurrence of accounting fraud based on previous studies, and constructed a model for detecting accounting fraud using logistic regression. following this, song et al. (2016) added variables reflecting the degree of substantive discretionary behavior and conservatism, as well as variables related to factors specific to japanese companies, to detect accounting fraud in japanese firms and built a model for detecting accounting fraud using logistic regression for japanese listed companies. perols et al. (2017) also aimed to improve detection accuracy using ensemble learning. specifically, they proposed dividing the explanatory variables according to the different types of accounting fraud, estimating accounting fraud using divided explanatory variables, and then building a single accounting fraud-detection model by combining these results. they reported that this method improves the classification performance of their detection models. however, there is a lack of research on the effectiveness of accounting fraud detection models for each type of accounting fraud in japanese firms. this study aims to build a detection model for each type of accounting fraud in a japanese company. this allows identifying the explanatory variables effective in the detection model for a particular type of accounting fraud and whether building a detection model for each type of accounting fraud improves detection accuracy. in this study, a profit-generating accounting fraud detection model was constructed for companies listed on the tokyo stock exchange from 2011 to 2019. furthermore, profit-generating fraud can be classified into four types: fraud related to revenue, expenses, assets, and liabilities. we constructed a fraudulent-accounting detection model and extracted effective explanatory variables for the detection of a specific type of fraudulent accounting. additionally, better accuracy exists for classifying the fraud by type in a detection model applied to certain types of fraudulent accounting than the accuracy of a detection model for the entire dataset.","accounting fraud, m. s., carcello",,"natsuki sato, ayuko komura, and hirohisa hirai department of industrial engineering and management kanagawa university kanagawa, japan r202170129yo@jindai.jp, komura-a@kanagawa-u.ac.jp, hirai@kanagawa-u.ac.jp",
359,Exploring The Risk Factors For Rear-End Collisions On  Indonesian Toll Roads,"rear-end collisions are the most frequent type of collision on toll roads in some countries. the potential risks of rear- end collisions were drivers, vehicles, roads, and the environment. in indonesia, rear-end collisions frequently occur on the jakarta-bogor-ciawi (jagorawi), cikampek-purwakarta-padalarang (cipularang) and cikopo-palimanan (cipali) toll roads. few previous studies have focused on risky driving behavior phenomena in indonesia on rear-end collision risks. this study aims to explore the risks of rear-end collisions on indonesian toll roads especially risky driving behavior. this study conducted a structured interview with 20 drivers and used voice call whatsapp application. the results showed that the rank (high-low) of rear-end collision risks based on participants’ perception were driver, road, environment, and vehicle. data show that 70% of participants choose to increase their speed to overtake the truck when it is directly in front of their vehicle. in other circumstances, 55% of participants drive at the same speed in a situation where the bus is the lead vehicle. it also happened in 90% of participants facing a passenger vehicle as the lead vehicle. in addition, the interview result show cipali and cipularang toll road sections have a high risk for rear-end collisions.","rear-end collisions, risk factors, toll roads","In this study, we explored rear-end collision risks in Indonesian toll roads as a preliminary study based on twenty participants. Several backgrounds of participants including age, occupation, driving experience, etc., were used in this study. The rank (high-low) of rear-end collisions risk based on participants’ perception were driver, road, environment, and vehicle. Our interview data show that 70% of participants chose to increase the speed and overtake the truck when facing a truck as the leading vehicle. In another condition, 55% of participants chose to drive at the same speed in the case that the bus was the leading vehicle. It also happened in 90% of participants facing the passenger vehicle as to the leading vehicle. In addition, the interview result shows Cipali dan Cipularang toll road section has a high risk for rear-end collision. This study has several limitations, namely the low sample size which may not represent Indonesian drivers as a whole and the interview process conducted may contain bias. However, more data may be needed for future research, especially surveys with large scale of driving behavior for mitigating rear-end collision risk factors and for developing these research findings.

367,A Comparative Study Between Linear And Non-Linear  Control Of Induction Motor,"induction motor is one of the most common motors in industrial applications because of its advantages related to its durability and low cost compared to other motors. in order to design the drive system of the induction motor, either scaler or vector methods are used. the vector control has a high dynamic performance in terms of response time and overcoming external disturbances. in this paper, a comparative study was presented between tow control methods for regulating motor speed based on the concept vector control. the paper focuses on the importance of regulating both components of the magnetic flux vector, in order to avoid the magnetic saturation that can occur when the system parameters change. the simulation results in matlab-simulink showed that back stepping controller has a robust performance compared to the pi regulator, where it achieves lower settling time and greater ability in overcoming external disturbances despite the change of system parameters.the both control systems was tested for the presence of a change in values of the stator and rotor resistances, the simulation results showed that a magnetic saturation has occurred in the machine in order to use pi regulator, but for a back stepping controller, this problem was eliminated. key words induction motor, magnetic saturation, back stepping, vector control. 1. introduction induction motors are classified as the most widely used motors due to their reliability, low cost and rigidity compared to other types of electric motors (ebrahim et al. 2010; nasir uddin et al. 2002 chen and zhang, 2015). despite that, induction motors were not commonly used in the past due to the difficulty of controlling their speed, rather, dc motors were relied upon for ease of controlling their speed. however, developments in electronic converters technologies effectively contributed to an increase in reliance on induction motors, until they became the most widely used in the world industry (chen and zhang, 2015; diyoke and okeke, 2016). in order to control the speed of the induction motor, various methods have been developed. the method of changing the frequency and voltage (v/f) is the simplest method [karthik and chelliah, 2016; peña and díaz, 2016.], the more complex methods are vector control methods, but these methods have high dynamic performance, so we rely in this article on vector control to design the control unit (ebrahim et al., 2010; chen and zhang, 2015; diyoke and okeke 2016). in order to design the control system, it is possible to rely on traditional regulators (pid) because they are simpler and easier to implement (chen and zhang 2015), but the performance of the control system in this case will be bad in terms of response speed and the system’s ability to overcome external disturbances and change system parameters (nasir uddin et al., 2002, chen and zhang 2015), so advanced control systems such as the linear quadratic controller (ebrahim et al., 2010; swargiary et al., 2015), sliding mode controller (liu and hao, 2006; benchaib et al., 1999), back stepping controller are relied upon [tan et al., 2003; trabelsi, et al., 2012.], it can also rely on intelligent and expert control systems to design the control system (fu and li 2015; kar et al. 2011; kwan and lewis 2000; bhushan et al., 2011). in our research, we will apply linear and non-linear control systems, but what distinguishes this research is conducting a test of the proposed control systems for the presence of a change in the parameters of the system, and studying the proceedings of the international conference on industrial engineering and operations management istanbul, turkey, march 7-10, 2022 ieom society international 3455",,"and Future Research Direction In this research, a comparative study was presented between tow control methods for regulating the motor speed based on the concept of vector control. The results of the paper indicate the importance of regulating the both components of the rotor flux vector, in order to avoid the occurrence of magnetic saturation in the machine when there is a change in the values of the stator and rotor resistances. The simulation results showed the superiority of the Back-Stepping controller compared to the PI in terms of response time characteristics (settling time and static error) and overcoming external disturbances.The using of back-stepping controller has clearly contributed to avoiding the problem of magnetic saturation and improving the dynamic performance of the induction motor. For future study, the control system should be implemented with a magnetic flux estimator design.","muhammet haşi̇mi̇, onur akbati department of control and automation engineering yildiz technical university istanbul, turkey muhammethasimi92@gmail.com, oakbatı@yildiz.edu.tr",
368,Blending Optimization In Traditional Diesel Oil Production  In Indonesia,"there are many old oil wells in indonesia which are no longer operated by the state-owned oil company pertamina. those wells have no longer a sufficient amount of oil to be extracted continuously. one such oil field is located in wonocolo district, bojonegoro in east java province. local miners are allowed to operate oil mining by using very simple equipment. currently, there are around 235 wells. each well produces 300 to 350 barrels of crude oil per day and was operated two times a week. the crude was sold to pertamina, but some of the crudes were processed by the miners by using a traditional distillation system called pawon. at least there are 190 pawon in the wonocolo district. the crude is processed into diesel oil. the oil is sold to the market with a price of idr 2,750. it is almost half of the price of the regular diesel oil sold by pertamina, idr 5,500 per liter. the objective of this study is to increase the quality of traditional diesel oil by applying simple blending operations. to achieve this objective, diesel oils produced by different pawon are treated as feedstock with different grades.traditional diesel oil is divided into 3 (three) grades based on its density. to obtain the cetane index value, the density and the distillation profile of diesel oil is needed. the astm d1298 astm d86 methods were used to obtain the density and distillation profile of the diesel oil. cetane index calculation was carried out by using astm d976 and astm d4737. blending is the process of mixing from several ingredients to obtain a new product which is in accordance with the desired specifications. volume comparisons of blending can affect the quantity and quality of new products produced. the purpose of this study is to obtain the optimal condition of the index of traditional diesel oil blended. the calculation results of the cetane index astm d976 are 50.66, 47.59, and 45.24 for grade 1, grade 2, and grade 3, respectively. the calculation results of the cetane index astm d4737 are 47.04, 45.08, and 43.47 for grade 1, grade 2, and grade 3, respectively. this information can be used to optimize the quality of the traditional diesel oil by diesel blending optimization. the optimization was carried out by applying response surface methods with design of experiment of three component mixture, i.e., the three grades of diesel oil. determination of optimal conditions the cetana index was performed by using design expert software with simplex lattice design with mixture design method. the optimum results were found and can increase the profit up to 66%. biographies rois fatoni, ph.d. is currently an associate professor of chemical engineering at the faculty of engineering universitas muhammadiyah surakarta. he also serves as dean of the faculty of engineering. before, he served as department chair in chemical engineering department in the same faculty between 2014-2021. he holds an undergraduate degree in chemical engineering department of faculty of engineering, universitas gadjah mada, jogjakarta, indonesia, a master’s in environmental process design, the university of manchester, u.k., and a ph.d. degree in chemical engineering program of university of waterloo, canada in 2012. during his phd studies he was supervised by professors ali elkamel and leonardo simon. his research interests include modeling, simulation, optimization, scheduling, process safety, mixture design, advanced materials, biomass, and innovative technology for medium-small scale industries. professor kun harismah, phd received his bsc in chemistry education from ikip semarang, indonesia; an msc in chemistry from the universitas gadjah mada, jogjakarta, indonesia and a ph.d. in organic chemistry from sheffield university, u.k., in 2009. she served in the department of chemical engineering, faculty of engineering universitas muhammadiyah surakarta. she also served as chair of intellectual property center of the university proceedings of the international conference on industrial engineering and operations management istanbul, turkey, march 7-10, 2022 ieom society international 3464",,,"rois fatoni, heni fidyayuningrum, kun harismah and a.m. fuadi department of chemical engineering faculty of engineering universitas muhammadiyah surakarta surakarta, indonesia rois.fatoni@ums.ac.id",
369,The Intention To Buy Europe Fashion Products Throught Ecommerce,"the existence of e-commerce has a positive impact on the economic, people nowadays are easy to buy the products that they need and want. this research’s objective is to determine the intention of buying europe fashion products through e-commerce. this research is using survey method. the respondents are people who buy fashion products through e-commerce. the sampling size is 100 samples but we take 150 samples to improve the reliability and validity of the propagated items and the collection is using a questionnaire. this research is using purposive sampling test for the data analysis. the results showed that customers intention to buy some products because of several factors, it is known that country of origin and product perception have significant influences towards brand image. further, brand image seems to affcet product purchase intentions through e-commerce marketplaces.","e-commerce, brand image, purchase intention, product perception","In this research country of origin, brand image and product perception have been studied to complete this research. Theories about country of origin variables, brand images and product perception have been elaborated and have a positive impact on the intention to purchase European fashion products through e-commerce or e-marketplace. The implications of this research is to explain that there are several factors to increase the intention to buy European fashion products in e-commerce for business managers. First, studies show the significant influence of the COO in the fashion industry in Indonesia. Nowadays in business world customers find it difficult to choose products because too much product information from the same category is provided by company. Therefore, consumers use country of origin image information as important information to evaluate a particular brand. The COO provides information on the level of education from country of origin, the level of quality of work and also creativity. Also, product perception can affect the brand image. As such, it is advisable for the European fashion brands to communicate intensively about their products through the e-commerce marketplace to enhance Indonesian fashion consumers’ perception of the brand image. Furthermore, this research identified that the importance of brand image is for the decision of buying intention. In the fashion industry sector, there is very intense competition a brandis demanding to find ways to stay competitive in the market. One way to achieve the goal is to create a positive brand image on the costumer mindset. Limitation and Future research The author still has limitations in this research, the author uses country of origin, brand image and product perception variables to measure purchasing intentions on European fashion products through e-commerce or e-marketplace. But for the furture research, all variables are still relevant for the research in impact on purchases, there are still other variables that can be recommended by the authors those are trust factors, ease of access and trend factors.","celine devina, tantyo yudistira business management program management department binus business school master program bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia 11480 celine.devina@binus.ac.id, tantyo.yudistira@binus.ac.id artha sejati ananda creative marketing program management department binus business school master program bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia 11480 artha.ananda@binus.edu",
370,Design Of Smart-Gate System For Monitoring Body  Temperature Detection During The Covid-19 Pandemic,"the current worldwide covid-19 pandemic created a vital need for innovative solutions to aid in early detection and control of the virus. high body temperature is one of the early symptoms of covid-19. thus, this project proposed to design and develop a smart-gate system that will be placed at an entrance of a public places such as markets, shops to detect the body temperature of a person entering and also calculate the level of social distance of the same place. the level of social distance is determined by the number of people in relation to the area. the system operates as follows; it calculates the level of social distancing of a public place showing the maximum number of people the place can hold at a time. when a person enters, the temperature is detected and if it is within the acceptable range, the system will send a signal to the gate to open only if the maximum number of people has not been exceeded. the system also displays the number of people on a screen. additionally, if the temperature exceeds 370c, the system will not send a signal to the gate to open while a buzzer is activated indicating the detection of covid symptom. this system developed for this study can be used in numerous applications such as stores, meeting rooms, classrooms, government buildings, courts, and hospitals.","arduino, smart-gate system, temperature sensor","and Future work An assumption can be made that the development and building of smart gate based on temperature detection could help reduce the risk of spreading the virus and provide a safe environment for visitors as much as possible. It also helps in identifying the individuals with the symptoms. The education system in world has suffered during COVID- 19 pandemic, and by using our electric and electronics tools, we build a project that may save lives from this pandemic. The project is built to be used in every public space, even remote areas. Our project supports the Saudi Ministry of Health in its fight against this pandemic. By providing a system that can test person's temperature and apply social distance. The result shows that the system is working as planned. For future work, we need to increase the size of motor so it can handle with large gates. Also, Iron gates can be replaced by aluminum ones, to reduce its weight for easy handling by the motor. Multi renewable power sources such as wind turbine, solar... etc. can be used in case of remote areas to make sure the system works almost all the time. The proposed design system can be attached to gates in airports, hospitals, subways, schools, train and bus stations, shopping malls, companies, universities, and other crowded places. Finally, with the current global population expansion and the possibility of future pandemics, the world needs to develop automation processes for effective and efficient task performance.

372,Productivity Improvement In Car Detailing Process At Java  Detailing Workshop With Mepis Productivity Cycle,"as the automotive world in indonesia has progressed, car vehicles are starting become a hobby item, car hobbyists consider their car is a life partner and want their car always in the best condition in terms of engine, interior, and exterior. in maintaining the condition of the interior and exterior, one solution is to use car detailing services, java detailing workshop is a workshop that provides car detailing services to make the interior and exterior conditions return to prime after only being used for a while. as the number of car hobbyists in the jabodetabek area grows, the workshop cannot meet the increasing demand for car detailing services every month so currently the company uses a reservation system and customers have to wait until the customer can be served after the customer has completed the reservation. to solve this problem, this research was made using the mepis productivity cycle method so that companies can increase their productivity in a sustainable manner assisted by an objective matrix to measure productivity and assisted by fishbone diagrams in conducting evaluations. it was found that the factors that affect productivity are the energy use and working time of each car, the improvements made in the fields of humans, machines, methods, and the environment with the results of electricity usage efficiency of 28% and car detailing time efficiency of 6% which can add service capacity one car per month.","productivity, mepis, objective matrix, fishbone diagram","The following are the conclusions of this study : 1. Factors that affect productivity in the car detailing process at the Java Detailing Workshop consist of human, machine, method, and environmental factors. The biggest factor related to the decrease in productivity in the car detailing process in the period November 2020 to October 2021 lies in the energy use obtained by the ratio of the cars served divided by energy use which has a total ratio value of 54 while the factor that can increase productivity is the time of work. each car obtained from the ratio of serviced cars divided by working hours of 84. So that these two factors need to be evaluated and planned for improvement in order to increase productivity in the car detailing process. 2. Based on performance indicators on energy use, November 2020 has the lowest performance indicator with a value of 265 which indicates that November 2020 has the worst productivity from energy use and May 2021 has the highest performance indicator with a value of 720 which indicates that in the month of May 2021 is the month with the best productivity of energy use in the period November 2020 to October 2021. 3. In planning and increasing productivity, it focuses on electricity consumption, improving human resources and also working methods. For electricity consumption itself, it can be done by rejuvenating the polishing machine which previously had 1250Watt power and replaced it with a new generation with 1000Watt power because it can reduce the power consumption of the polishing machine by 25% from the previous one, as well as replacing lamps that previously used 72Watt fluorescent lamps with 40Watt LED lamps which have a high level of the same brightness and can reduce lamp power consumption by 80%, which for the total electricity use of each car decreased by 28% which previously had an average of Rp. 179,004 after the improvement was made to Rp. 140,183. Then to improve human resources and work methods, it can speed up the car detailing work which was originally to complete one car it took 25 hours 22 minutes and after improvement it became 24 hours 12 minutes which shortened the total time for car detailing by 1 hour 10 minutes or equal to 6% faster than before the improvement. By accelerating the processing time, it will directly increase the service capacity and also increase the productivity of energy use.","alif akbar ramadhani student of industrial and system engineering faculty of industrial technology and system engineering institut teknologi sepuluh nopember surabaya, indonesia ralifakbar@yahoo.com patdono suwignjo associate professor in industrial and system engineering faculty of industrial technology and system engineering institut teknologi sepuluh nopember surabaya, indonesia patdono@ie.its.ac.id moses laksono singgih professor in industrial and system engineering faculty of industrial technology and system engineering institut teknologi sepuluh nopember surabaya, indonesia moseslsinggih@ie.its.ac.id",

374,Optimal Supply Chain Networks Under Failure Risks Using  Meta-Heuristic Algorithms,"many industrial companies continue to face global uncertainties in demand and failures in supply. the main purpose of this research is to design and optimize a supply chain network (scn) that performs under completely uncertain environment. in this paper, three advanced meta-heuristic algorithms based on broyden-fletcher-goldfarb-shanno (bfgs), powell, and non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (nsga-ii) are used to solve the optimization problem. a real-life case study for a steel manufacturing integrated supply chain is used to demonstrate the efficiency of the model and the solutions obtained by meta-heuristic algorithms. the objective was to maximize the total profit of supply chain network under disruption conditions. the presented mathematical modeling provides an understandable overview of the system for managers to make appropriate decisions to achieve the maximum profit. findings revealed that advanced meta-heuristic algorithms were the most efficient technique to solve the proposed model when compared with the traditional method.",stochastic demand,"Global Supply Chain Networks (GSCNs) experiencing failures in supply require investigation to discover the cause of supply delays. In this study, a mathematical model was developed to predict the delays and failures in supply. The problem was developed as a multi-objective function to optimize multi-stage supply chain networks under risks of failure in order to achieve the least cost and greatest profit. The model considered in this paper presented integrated supply chain decisions to optimize the delivery of products under demand uncertainty and failure risks (disruptions, 0.00E+00 5.00E+00 1.00E+01 1.50E+01 2.00E+01 2.50E+01 3.00E+01 3.50E+01 4.00E+01 4.50E+01 1 4 7 10 13 16 19 22 25 28 31 34 37 40 43 46 49 52 55 58 61 64 67 70 73 76 79 Optimal Solution (Profit) ($) Iterations Model (Validation) Model (Training) Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management Istanbul, Turkey, March 7-10, 2022 IEOM Society International 3551","abdulhadi altherwi department of industrial engineering jazan university jazan, saudi arabia aaaltherwi@jazanu.edu.sa, a.aaltherwi@hotmail.com daw alwerfalli a leon linton department of mechanical engineering lawrence technological university southfield, mi 48075, usa dalwerfal@ltu.edu william edwards department of industrial and systems engineering oakland university rochester, mi 48309, usa wedwards@oakland.edu","References

379,Saudia Dairy And Foodstuff Company (Sadafco)  Competitive Position,"this research studies saudia dairy and foodstuff company (sadafco) and its competitive position in the saudi market. a comprehensive background analysis of the organization was conducted. then, data were collected implementing strategic management tools to assess the organization's competitive position. the data analysis was executed using three different strategic analytical tools to understand and evaluate the organization's internal and external status. the employed analytical tools are pestel, swot, and porter's five-force model. the company background and products are discussed in the first section of the research, followed by the literature review, which discusses the theoretical and empirical overviews of the strategic management tools. this research study obtained data from secondary sources: published research articles, industry reports, and company websites to gain the maximum amount of information. based on the analysis, different strategic recommendations are provided to keep the company's competitive position. the findings have shown that sadafco offers the highest price range in some product categories, such as milk products, compared to its competitors, which declined its market share. based on the research results, it is recommended that sadafco should reconsider and reexamine its pricing strategies to attract consumers and improve its competitive position.","sadafco, swot, pestel","In summary, the two most effective and appropriate strategies for mapping factors that impact SADAFCO operations are SWOT and PESTLE analysis. In light of these assertions, the SWOT and PESTLE analyses conducted gave a birds-eye view of factors that affect SADAFCO's internal and external operations. The SWOT analysis identifies strengths, weaknesses, threats, and opportunities that the company faces. Some strengths held by the company include a wide range of products, using different pricing strategies, and substantial brand equity. While the company has considerable powers, a few weaknesses can disrupt operational sustainability. The dominant weaknesses include a lack of raw milk in Saudi Arabia since the company supplies milk products. Moreover, SADAFCO faces aggressive competition from AlMarai, making it challenging to introduce fresh milk, primarily because of changing prices. That said, competitors such as AlMarai have a wide product range providing a better diversity than SADAFCO. Amid desires to embrace optimization and quality assurance, the company incurs high operational costs that are sometimes difficult to source. High operational costs limit the profit margins that companies can potentially make. The SWOT analysis findings indicate that SADAFCO can utilize its lead position in the supply of tomato pastes. Therefore, the company must hold the position and leverage avenues for expanding its operations. Secondly, the company has a solid financial record and can use its resources to diversify its product line. The primary threat SADAFCO faces are competition, both domestic and international. Accordingly, the PESTLE analysis reveals that Saudi Arabia is stable politically. Still, disruptive trends such as border conflicts can hinder business operations while rising inflation rates reduce disposable income, while changes in social movements can be leveraged positively or negatively. The inclusion of SWOT, PESTEL, and Porter's five forces analysis was instrumental in understanding the company's position in the market. It is imperative for the company to effectively utilize its competitive advantage and address its weaknesses and threats to maintain its sustainability and reduce risk.","esraa aldabbagh master's of business administration dar al hekma university jeddah, saudi arabia emdabbagh@dah.edu.sa lojien jowharji master's of business administration dar al hekma university jeddah, saudi arabia lijowharji@dah.edu.sa mostafa fawzy, ph.d., cpem management and marketing department dar al hekma university jeddah, saudi arabia mfawzi@dah.edu.sa",
380,Using Microsoft Power Bi And Data Visualization Tools To  Study How Online Shopping Was Affected During Covid-,,,"By analyzing the data that was collected pre-COVID-19 in 2019 and comparing it with the data that was collected post-COVID-19 in 2020, it was concluded that the demand for all sorts of e-commerce is being sought right now and is the preferable option for many countries across the globe in comparison to shopping in physical stores. The percentages that were deduced as a result of the analysis show an increase of 3.0%, 4.2%, and 7.5% post-COVID-19 in each of the United States, China and the United Kingdom, respectively. The positive change in the percentages took place due to the circumstances that people were going through. For example, some were forced to revert to online shopping due to lockdowns and store closures, while others were afraid of contacting infected people while they go out and purchase the things they need. Furthermore, others preferred online shopping because e-commerce was convenient and easily accessible. Upon further analysis, it was also deduced that this change will not be a temporary one, but rather a permanent one with lasting effect. More people continue to rely on e-commerce even though the current COVID-19 conditions have slightly lifted and some countries are returning back to how the life routine used to be. This information was based on a survey result in which participants were asked if they would continue to shop online, and the majority of the participants by 62% indicated that they either strongly agree or agree with the statement “I only buy online post-COVID-19”. This means that the effects of COVID-19 are going to have a lasting impact specifically on the economic sector in the future. Hence, the research contribution was illustrated in section 5.3.",,

382,Establishing Autonomy Of House Ownership In Low-Income,"housing backlog magelang city (indonesia) is still very high. most of the contributors to the backlog are low-income society (lis). the magelang city government owns three rental flats and two leased landed houses for lis. the rental period for residential units is limited, the maximum is 6 years. after that, it is unknown where the tenant will live. inviting residential tenants to set aside money for savings is not easy, because their income is limited and their desire to use money for tertiary needs often arises due to the consumptive culture of the community. therefore, an ivitation was made that compels tenants to save regularly and cannot be taken except for the purpose of building their own private house, so that it is hoped that after the rental period is over, they will have money for home ownership purposes. to be more enthusiastic in saving, a community was formed between residents to support each other, as well as awards for good savers. therefore, a cooperation agreement was made with a bank owned by the regional government that served its money storage facility by the way the bank picked up the money, as a form of service to customers. with an approach to the community, a land plot owner was found who was willing to sell his land at a low price. and the land plots can be used for 20 units of very simple houses. to overcome the insufficient budget owned by residential tenants to purchase land plots, a cooperation agreement was made with local government-owned banks so that they can serve land purchase loans with low interest (6%) and long payment terms (15 years). for the process of providing houses, the source of funding for very simple houses (36m2) was obtained from the central java provincial government.","house ownership, low-income society, money saving","1. Saving is simple yet difficult to implement if there is no strong will with a specific purpose, especially for low- income people. Activities such as saving the need to be controlled so that low-income families are able to be disciplined in committing so. The rewards for depositors who perform well can encourage the community to be motivated in saving. 2. There is a great need for assistance from local governments in preparing housing for low-income families by utilizing the potential that exists in the community. 3. The need for cooperation between existing government institutions for activities related to the living needs of low-income families through available programs and new programs that can be immediately designed because there are many basic needs of life, in this case, is the provision of housing. 4. Local governments must take precise initiative towards policies in Regional-Owned Enterprises for the benefit of the people by the readiness to assist in administrative completeness so that they will not violate regulations. 5. The implementation of this research activity can lead to two programs that have never been implemented previously, which is the emergence of the Low-Cost Home Ownership Credit program by Perumda BPR Bank Magelang and the TNI Service Program with the Magelang City Government for handling housing for Low- Income Families.","kun arsanti dewi, nurul aini sinta dewi department of housing and settlement areas, magelang city, magelang, indonesia persit kartika chandra kirana koorcab rem 051 pd jaya kunarsantiwardoyo@yahoo.com, daunhujan2020@gmail.com encep rukhiyat marsadi communities care for housing and settlements in indonesia, bandung, indonesia emarsadi@gmail.com handini rahayu development planning agency at sub-national level, magelang city, magelang, indonesia dinie.lila74@gmail.com suyamto residential area, bpr bank magelang, magelang, indonesia syatoo.07@gmail.com budiyono department of public works and spatial planning magelang city, magelang, indonesia budiyono.19680106@gmail.com",

384,Evaluating Company X’S Product Mix And Product Size To  Maximize Profit,"company x is a worldwide market dealing mainly in decorative paints and performance coating. more specifically the company is classified as a matrix organization that is divided into seven regions which are responsible for the sales of marine (27%), protective (24%), and powder(10%) coatings as well as decorative paints(39%). the company is represented in more than 100 countries in the world where it operates with 37 production facilities in over 21 countries and 63 companies in 45 countries. in this report, we will analyze how the company’s investment in resources (raw materials) will allow them to reach their optimal combination of products to be produced to obtain a maximum return, and ultimately reach the goal of maximizing their profits.","operations research, optimization, maximizing profit, paint company","How Will the Two Maximization Processes Help Company X Reach Their Goal? Since decorative paints shape up to 39% of the company’s income, controlling the production of decorative paints will deem the most effective when it comes to the overall profit. Company X aims to maximize their profit in order to improve their four segments and the current market, therefore the reexamination of their investment in raw materials will be based on the best size and type that is concluded through maximizing the product size and product mix decorative paints. To summarize, this maximization procedure will allow Company X to reevaluate their raw material investments by maximizing product mix and product size in order to have the best candidate to allow Company X to allocate their investments on the proper raw materials and amounts. The optimal product size was 1.3 Gallons, and the best product mix was Academy Paint, as determined through the process of maximizing product size and product mix. To optimize the profit from 1.3 gallons of Academy Paint, the company should allocate its investments to the appropriate raw ingredients and amounts. A number of conclusions were drawn as a result of this investigation. Managers of the case study organization, for example, do not employ sophisticated scientific instruments such as LINGO to plan their operations and production. This optimization model could be used in a factory setting to help managers to select the most profitable production plan. We can see the effects of changing resources on a profit from the results of using LINGO software to analyze the product mix of the company's five products (Powder Finish Paint, Antifungal Paint, Silk Finish Paint, Matte Finish Paint, and Textures Paint), and how it can help make informed decisions about resources used for production; water, titanium dioxide, calcium carbonate, a binder resin, color paste, additives, sand, kerosene, Pigment-coloring material, plant capacity It also enables managers to make decisions about employee overtime, the recruiting of temporary workers, and the use and ordering of raw supplies. This model may be utilized on a continuous basis, giving managers the flexibility to run what-if scenarios and gain meaningful insight into the impact of resource changes on profitability. Tackling the uncertainty of today's international economy on the cusp of the twenty-first century, as well as technology innovation and other competitive forces that combine in a complex manner, complex decision-making problems arise. It is difficult to create a schedule that is both practical and cost-effective. As a result, organizations benefit from the acquisition of analytical methods like linear programming and associated software for analyzing and manipulating huge organization operations and production data.","dr. sobhi mejjaouli department of industrial engineering alfaisal university al takhassousi, al zahrawi street, riyadh 11533 smejjaouli@alfaisal.edu alanoud alsabhan aalsabhan@alfaisal.edu haifa alshathry hblshathry@alfaisal.edu rima aleisa realeisa@alfaisal.edu",
385,The Future Of Digital Procurement And Its  Benefits In The  Global Supply Chain,"companies are striving to improve their management system in a period of economic globalization, where the environment is increasingly competitive and widespread. in this era of industry 4.0, most companies try to be reactive and agile, by implementing new technologies such as artificial intelligence (ai), robotics and internet of things (iot) in all the supply chains processes. procurement is considered as a vital function in supply chain management since it has a direct impact on the savings of the company, and it can provide new opportunities for the value chain to enhance efficiency and effectiveness. therefore, while digitalization is the key driver of the fourth industrial revolution, procurement managers need to digitalize this process to drive innovation and ensure the market leadership of their companies. the main purpose of this paper is to identify the critical role of e-procurement in providing greater flexibility and control over all aspects of the purchasing process. this article is based on a real case study from the food industry, and it aims to bring light to digital transformation in the procurement process and its practical outcomes.","supply chain, industry 4.0","This paper has presented the findings of a research on the future of digital procurement and its benefits in the global supply chain, based on a real case study of one of the leading companies of the food industry. First of all, we started by identifying the issue and the current situation, to frame the retrieved studies and liaise them to the company’s procurement department. Then, choosing the relevant digital solution to increase the profitability of the department and evaluating the impact. Finally, determining the gap between actual and required performance and analyzing factors that need to be adjusted. An Industry Revolution is typically driven by revolutionary technological developments that have resulted in significant developments in how the industry function. These developments have an economic and cultural impact. Some are purposeful and beneficial, while others are unintentional and undesirable. Industry 4.0, like its predecessors, is driven by technology. In this intriguing field, our findings are just a starting point for future research such as: - Procurement and the Industry 5.0: Industry fifth revolution is primarily about linking equipment and about human-machine cooperation on the production floor of lists for the benefits of human-machine collaboration. - 3656","lebhar ikram industrial engineering ensam-meknes school of engineering university moulay ismail, morocco lebharikram@gmail.com dadda afaf, ezzine latifa full professor of industrial engineering ensam-meknes school of engineering university moulay ismail, morocco a.dadda@ensam.umi.ac.ma, latifae@yahoo.com","References :

It presents guidelines for users in the brainstorming process and surmounts the classical Ishikawa diagram barriers. Substance inventory helps users to overcome psychological inertia and the time pillar integrates the evolution system concept in the diagram. Using TRIZ resources as cornerstones avoids the need to add more cornerstones. In addition, we are aware that a unique case study does not allow diagram generalization. Therefore, it is necessary, in future research, to explore the diagram in a different field with different issues.","soumaya elyoussoufi laboratory lm2i, department 2d2i national school of electricity and mechanics (ensem) hassan ii university casablanca, morocco soumaya.elyoussoufi@ensem.ac.ma mohamed mazouzi laboratory lm2i, department 2d2i national school of electricity and mechanics (ensem) hassan ii university casablanca, morocco m.mazouzi@ensem.ac.ma anass cherrafi ensam school moulay ismail university a.cherrafi@ensam.umi.ac.ma el mehdi tamasna laboratory lm2i, department 2d2i national school of electricity and mechanics (ensem) hassan ii university casablanca, morocco el-mehdi.tamasna@ensem.ac.ma",

392,Perceived Effect Of Academic Stress To The Performance Of  Students During Online Class,"not only do students experience mental issues during the pandemic but as well as perceived academic stress through online learning at mapua university. considering the norm of conducting classes in an online setup without face- to-face with classmates and professors, the faculty and counselors of mapua university are not fully updated about the student's whereabouts and mental health, which prohibits them from being aware of the student's current condition during the pandemic. students from various departments were taken as samples to answer a survey via google forms containing the respondent's personal information such as their age, gender, type of course, current enrollment status, and recent academic performance (lwa). then, respondents will choose among subfactors (i.e. examination times are very stressful to me) with the likert scale from 1 to 5. various statistical tools, such as regression analysis, anova, and pearson correlation analysis, were utilized to determine if factors and subfactors are statistically significant towards pas. results showed that all subfactors are significant and contribute to pas, while for the regression, the difficulty of exams has the highest effect on lwa. enrolment status and year level of the student also has a significant effect on pas. lastly, academic self-perception vs. academic performance, pressure to perform vs. perception of workload, pressure to perform vs. time restraints, perception of workload vs. time restraints are found to have a moderate correlation.","mental health, condition","Just as professors handle multiple blocks for their subjects, the students take different subject courses with varying workloads. With the current pandemic, both sides are struggling, at the same time, to adjust to the new setup, which has been proven difficult for a lot of people involved. Based on the results of this study, students are finding it hard to balance their home obligations and academic role as there is no clear boundary between the two at home. Not all students are granted a healthy and efficient environment; thus, they have a lot on their plate to manage. With these summarizations, the researchers would like this paper to reach professors as this offers an insight on how the students are faring in this online situation. The two sides, the professors and the students, had to adjust to the pandemic abruptly, and it is logical to say that it is hard for everyone. As they are teachers and seniors in life, it would help a lot if they could adjust to the student's needs and understand their different circumstances. Offering a detailed school work schedule and progress, with a reasonable consideration on varying setup, would be a good step for the students to adjust their plans. Exams, which are highlighted to be difficult for students, also need to be addressed. With the results of this study, the exams given by the professors would be accepted well if they could be answerable with the platforms being used. It would also be good if both sides could communicate well to not have any misunderstandings among them. Professors that are easy to reach and talk to give relief to struggling students. As this online situation has both the giving and receiving end, the students must play their role well. Knowing the problem is already half of the solution, and this study would also help to know exactly what they are facing. As they are still students in this setup, they should study well and effectively as each subject is essential in any course. It would be good if they try to set priorities and work efficiently in a not self-damaging way. At any time, it would be best to try what they could do and always communicate their issues effectively. This setup is complex and one-of-its-kind. As a measure, this paper would like to suggest utilizing the readily available platforms for students and unifying a schedule that has ample time to work and learn.","maria angelica d. bare, francee mae f. castro, jhon lawrence g. quimio, ma. janice j. gumasing school of industrial engineering and engineering management mapua university muralla st. intramuros, manila madbare@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, fmfcastro@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, jlgquimio@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, mjjgumasing@mapua.edu.ph",

398,Estimation Of Compaction Characteristics Using Machine  Learning Techniques,"application of machine learning which is the main driver of artificial intelligence is gradually gaining ground in the field of geotechnical engineering for prediction and forecasting. in the present research, efforts are made to explore some machine learning techniques such as: support vector machine, random forest, artificial neural networks, m5 tree and multiple linear regression models to correlate maximum dry density and optimum moisture content with somesoil index properties where the best predicting model was determined. four hundred and eighty (480) soil samples were obtained and divided into data set using training and validation of the developed models from the basic soil parameters. the goodness of fit between the actual and the predicted valuesshowed that the values of root mean square error 253.84, 295.44, 218.08, 101.63, 211.12 and 3.91, 4.55, 3.54, 1.67, 20.13. are from support vector machine; random forest, artificial neural networks, m5 tree and multiple linear regression models for maximum dry density and optimum moisture content values respectively. the least values 101.63 and 1.67 was observed from random forest for maximum dry density and optimum moisture content. similarly, the correlation coefficient valuesrange between 0.15 – 0.96 and 0.2 ─0.96. from the foregoing, the correlation coefficient value proved the random forest model as the bestfor estimating maximum dry density and optimum moisture content while the model having the least correlation coefficient is the multiple linear regression model for maximum dry density and support vector machine for optimum moisture content respectively. it’s concluded that this research work will be an excellent guidetoconstructors, future planners and civil engineers for estimation of unavailable data, and for cross checking the observed values particularly at the project preliminary stageswithin the study area. key words: compaction characteristics, correlation coefficient, machine learning, optimum moisture content and maximum dry density. 1. introduction holtz et al. (2010) defines soil compaction as a mechanical process which accounts for the increase in the density of soil by reducing the air volume from the pore spaces. according to him, this results in the changes that occur in pore space size, particle distribution, and the strength of the soil. rollings and rollings (1996) opined that, the major purpose of the compaction process is the increase in strength and stiffness of the soil by reduction in the compressibility and decrease in the permeability of the soil mass by its porosity. the type of soil and the grain sizes of the soil play a significant role in compaction process as a reduction in pore spaces within the soil increases the bulk density. soil types with higher percentages of clay and silt have a lower density than coarse-grained soil since they naturally have more pore spaces. going by hausman (1990) the compaction curve obtained in the laboratory tests or field compaction is a representation of the typical moisture-density curve which clarifies the compaction characteristics theory. the importance of this property is well appreciated in the construction of earth dams and other earth filling projects. it is a vital process and is employed during the construction projects such as; highway, railway proceedings of the international conference on industrial engineering and operations management istanbul, turkey, march 7-10, 2022 ieom society international 3744",,"It is observed from the results that machine learning techniques has an excellent contribution in geotechnical engineering.

399,Analysis Of Factors That Affect E-Commerce Technology  Adoption Msmes In Indonesia,"msmes (micro, small, and medium enterprises) play a significant role in indonesia's economy. e-commerce has many advantages for msmes which includes competitive advantage, greater market share and better customer service, among others. indonesian users are already proficient with e-commerce but unfortunately only 19% of indonesian msmes have adopted e-commerce. this research investigates the variables that influence e-commerce technology adoption in indonesian msmes using technology acceptance model, technology organization environment (toe) framework and diffusion of innovation (doi) theory. a survey questionnaire was conducted to collect data from 260 msme owners in the food and beverage industry who have or have not adopted e-commerce technology for their business. the result was calculated using logistic regression and relative importance index (rii) to get which variables are relevant in e-commerce adoption in indonesia msmes. from the research, it is revealed that relative advantage, perceived usefulness, security, employee’s it knowledge and government’s support have a crucial influence in e-commerce adoption for msme owners. an e-commerce adoption strategy was recommended based on the study’s results. it is focused on the most significant factors of e-commerce adoption for msmes to increase the chances of adoption.","e-commerce adoption, msmes","MSMEs are an important and major part of Indonesia’s economy. In this research 10 variables were determined as e- commerce adoption factors for MSMEs from literature review and experts. Then, 5 variables are found to be statistically significant: relative advantage, perceived usefulness, security, employee’s IT knowledge, and government support. From the 5 significant factors, relative importance index was conducted and employee IT knowledge was discovered to be the most important element in e-commerce adoption for MSMEs in Indonesia. A strategy was formulated based on the findings of the study called “E-commerce Blended Training” to achieve e-commerce adoption in MSMEs.","denisha vanda ersa firsty, muhammad dachyar industrial engineering, faculty of engineering university of indonesia depok, indonesia vanda.denisha@gmail.com , mdachyar@yahoo.com",
400,A Fuzzy Multicriteria Decision Making Approach   For Lean Supplier Selection,"supplier selection is a problem that is tried to be solved using many different methods and approaches. however, it is known that it is mainly handled with multicriteria decision making methods (mcdm) since it is affected by many conflicting criteria. this study discusses the supplier selection problem of a company working under a lean management approach. a detailed literature review was conducted to reveal the lean criteria taken into account in the literature of supplier selection. in the first phase of this study, the criteria obtained from the literature review were examined and weighted with the fuzzy dematel (decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory) method, widely used in the research fields and provides successful solutions. as a result of the application of the method, the weight of each evaluation criterion was determined and used as an input in the selection of the suppliers. in the second phase of the study, the fuzzy edas was employed to obtain the final ranking and select the most effective supplier for the company's success. then obtained result is presented to the managers for better decisions.","supplier selection, lean supply, fuzzy mcdm, fuzzy dematel","When determining the lean criteria to be applied in supplier selection, the criteria in the literature were used and these criteria were gathered under 15 top groups. It is possible to say that these groups can change the results of Fuzzy DEMATEL. From the literature survey, it is determined that some authors, for example, combined cost and price under the same criteria, while others considered them separately. Although quality and delivery were the most common criteria, Lean Culture and Sustainability were not considered in most studies. For similar reasons, it can be stated that the description of the criteria is a factor affecting the ranking. Design and sustainability criteria were not taken into account in this study as they were below the threshold values. Accordingly, it can be signified that the company does not need a supplier for design. Although the Lean philosophy foresees integration with the supplier, it is an unexpected result that sustainability and collaboration are in the last place. It can be suggested for future studies to take new criteria for the selection of lean suppliers in more detail by adding them.

404,The Role Of Emotional Exhaustion In Understanding The  Relationship Between Hybrid Work Characteristics And,"impromptu changes in work design during the covid-19 pandemic turned out changing the innovative work behavior of millennials and generation z employees due to being emotionally exhausted while adapting to new work characteristic. dissatisfaction has led these employees suggesting hybrid working arrangement which some literature found is characterized by boundarylessness, multitasking, demand for constant learning, and non-work related interruptions to be adopted by organizations. this research investigates the role of emotional exhaustion in understanding the influence of hybrid work characteristics on innovative work behavior based on those experienced working in hybrid working arrangements. primary data was collected from 177 respondents and were analyzed using partial least squares-structural equation modeling (pls-sem). the results confirmed a significant influence between hybrid work characteristics to emotional exhaustion, emotional exhaustion to innovative work behaviour, and the mediation effects except for multitasking. this study adds and fills the gap of research in understanding the role of emotional exhaustion in the application of new work design on millennials and generation z. instead of bringing deterioration, emotional exhaustion was found triggering employees to be more innovative in their works while working in hybrid working arrangement. for that, organizations might consider adopting this new approach of work design.",work design,"This research examines the role of emotional exhaustion in understanding how hybrid work characteristics influencing innovative work behavior based on those experienced working in hybrid working arrangement within the context of Millennials and Generation Z employees. Rather than working remotely that still bounded by working hour rules which vague as working time still exceeding the regulated hours as proven during COVID-19 pandemic leading to employees being exhausted, the addition to flexible working hours in hybrid working arrangement is proven able to increase innovative work behavior even though it might be still emotionally exhausted for them in some way. Therefore, extending the adoption from remote working to hybrid working arrangement can be one better option to choose for the post-pandemic work design in Indonesia to cope with further uncertain business environments. The scope of this study has limitations, such as the small number and characteristics of the samples examined. Only 177 samples can be obtained in this research which specific to small region only in Jakarta Metropolitan Area as it was difficult to find respondents within the time constraints which might concerning whether findings can really represent the population. This study also extending to one variable only which still in the scope of individual behavior which might still questioning how the interpretation would really impact the whole organization. Studying using descriptive- quantitative approach also limits understanding how these variables influencing each other in practical. It is highly suggested for the future research to widen the scope of research both in numbers and region especially measuring in country-sized to be able capturing the overall behavior so it can be compared between countries. Adding or replacing variables that can measure the impact to the whole organization in the future will be better to provide enhancement whether these work design characteristics is effective to be adopted by organizations. Whereas new findings are discovered in this research, it is also highly suggested for further research to directly observe using qualitative approach to obtain deeper understanding the emotional state resulted from the adoption of hybrid working approach.","innovative work behavior in hybrid working arrangement dony saputra management department binus business school undergraduate program bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia dony.saputra@binus.ac.id amanda puteri rozyanti management department binus business school undergraduate program bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia amanda.rozyanti@binus.ac.id",
405,Determination Of Factors And Location Of Wave Power  Generating For Islands In Indonesia,"to support the indonesia government in achieving sdgs' target no. 7, developing environmentally friendly alternative energy is necessary. this research seeks to support the development of a wave energy power plant with great potential in indonesia as an archipelagic country. the factors are collected from previous research to be considered in developing the design of a sea wave energy power plant. determination of the location begins by collecting several locations that have been recommended by previous researchers, generally from the consideration of the magnitude of the potential for ocean wave energy. simeuleu, nias, siberut, and enggano islands have an essential local cost of providing electricity higher than the electricity tariff generated by ocean wave energy power plants, which is economically advantageous. considering the criteria for potential wave resources, the essential cost of providing electricity, and potential replacement of existing d/g power plant, the analytic hierarchy process (ahp) method synthesizes nias island as the best location for ocean wave energy power plants. all locations with a significant potential for ocean wave energy are located in earthquake and tsunami-prone areas. therefore, the design of power plants must be resistant to earthquakes and tsunamis.","renewable, energy, ocean wave","Based on the data analysis above, the conclusion is: 1. Several factors need to be considered in the development of ocean wave energy power plants, as shown in Table 1. 2. Some areas are recommended for ocean waves energy harvestings in the resources potential view, such as West Sumatera, South of Java, and South of Bali. 3. All areas that will contain a high potential for ocean wave energy are located in areas prone to earthquakes and tsunamis. It can be a challenge for the development of ocean wave energy converters. 4. In terms of the level of competition with other power plants, the development of ocean wave energy power plants on the islands of Java and Bali will face stiff competition against hydropower plants. Due to power plants in Indonesia, 74% are located on the islands of Java and Bali. 5. In terms of the level of competition with other power plants and energy demand, the development of ocean wave energy power plants should be carried out in: a) Sumatra Island, for the following reasons: 1. The level of energy demand is relatively high; 2. The highest ocean wave energy potential; 3. 16% of Indonesia's power plants in Sumatra. b) The northern part of the islands of Maluku and Papua. Because of the following reason: 1. Most of the power plants that fill the area use diesel power plants, which are expensive and pollute the environment; 2. The potential for ocean wave energy is quite enormous; 3. Geographical conditions with many small islands separated by the deep sea. 6. Under the results of the synthesis of the AHP method, it was found that Nias Island is the most suitable location for ocean wave energy power plants. Locations on the islands of Enggano, Siberut, and Simeuleu also remain profitable for ocean wave energy power plants because the essential cost of providing electricity is higher than the electricity tariff for ocean wave energy.","chabibi nur thahlil program study magister management technology school of interdisciplinary management and technology institut teknologi sepuluh nopember surabaya, indonesia chabibi.nurt@yahoo.com moses laksono singgih professor in department of industrial and systems engineering faculty of industrial technology and systems engineering institut teknologi sepuluh nopember surabaya, indonesia moseslsinggih@ie.its.ac.id",
406,Effects Of Academic Workload To The Mental Fatigue Of  Students During Online Class,"the present study quantitatively examines the relationship between the effects of academic workload to the perceived mental fatigue of undergraduate college students from mapúa university in the philippines. the current global pandemic and the abrupt shift from face-to-face classes to remote learning affected the students' mental health. the researchers used data from a sample of 104 respondents obtained from a digital survey containing the fatigue assessment scale and nasa-task load index, which was then analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. results presented a strong relationship between the academic workload factors during online classes and students' overall mental fatigue level. thus, results show that these factors significantly contribute to the intensity of the mental fatigue of college students. based on the conclusion, the results show that the fas is greatly affected by each dimension – mentally or physically. in addition, the academic workload assigned to each respondent shows that all cognitive factors such as mental demand, physical demand, temporal demand, effort, and frustration are significantly affected due to the assigned workload to the students during an online class. thus, resulting to students must exert more mental effort to accomplish required outputs.","fas, mental fatigue",,"madeline anne patrice c. sy, maryam g. irenea, frankern luis s. malabuyoc, ma. daniella m. sobrevilla, ma. janice j. gumasing school of industrial engineering and engineering management mapua university muralla st. intramuros, manila mapcsy@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, mgirenea@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, flsmalabuyoc@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, mjjgumasing@mapua.edu.ph","References

408,The Influence Of Price And Quality On Purchasing Decisions  For Luxcrime Products,"the increasing competition of the cosmetic industry makes companies that each other will compete with each other so that the products produced have the most superior quality among products produced by similar companies. because consumers will consider the price and quality of a product before they make a purchase decision. but currently local products are not less competitive with other imported products. this research was conducted to find out the effect of price and quality on luxcrime product purchase decisions. this study is a quantitative study using the smartpls application version 3 with the number of samples used, namely 100 respondents who have or are using luxcrime products. the data collection technique used in this study is by spreading questionnaires online. the results showed that all variables had a positive and significant influence on purchasing decisions.","price, quality, costumer behavior","Some of the necessary conclusions can provide answers to the problems formulated in this study, namely as follows: 1. The results of a study conducted on 100 respondents tested using the SmartPLS application showed that price and quality had an effect on luxcrime product purchasing decisions, in the overall respondents' view was in a fairly good and significant category. This indicates that the purchase decision is determined by price and quality. 2. Researchers have three hypotheses in this study, namely price influences purchasing decisions, which in the view of respondents are in a fairly good and significant category. This means showing that consumers will choose the product with regard to the affordability of the price offered by Luxcrime and the price offered must match the quality of the product. Both prices affect quality, which in the respondent's view is in a fairly good and significant category. This indicates if the price also determines the quality of a product. When consumers buy a product at a high price, then the expected quality will be higher. Therefore, the company must provide the best quality to consumers. These three qualities affect purchasing decisions, which in the respondent's view are in a fairly good and significant category. This shows if the company produces a product that is of good quality then consumers will be loyal and trust the product. In this study the relationship between free variables had such a significant and positive influence that hypotheses could be accepted.

409,The Influence Of Intrinsic Factors And Prices On   Impulse Buying Between Consumers On,"the rise of online shopping platforms or e-commerce in indonesia makes consumers' passion increase to shop easily through e-commerce applications such as shopee. nowadays, consumers prefer and find it easier to shop online than having to shop in offline stores to streamline their time and supported by several factors that influence the occurrence of impulse buying consumers. intrinsic factor from within consumers and competitive prices and quite affordable and promos provided on the shopee platform make the emergence of impulse buying behavior in shopee consumers. this study examines the factors that influence consumers in shopping to have impulse buying behavior. the respondents used in the study were shopee consumers, as many as 100 respondents analyzed using path analysis in the smartpls 3 application. the results of this study show that all the variables that have been tested have a positive and significant effect on impulse buying shopee consumers.","intrinsic factor, price, impulse buying, consumer behavior","Some conclusions that are expected to be relied upon to provide answers to the problems formulated in this study in Shopee consumers are as follows: 1. The results of the study conducted by spreading questionnaires to 100 shopee consumer respondents obtained results that intrinsic factor and price to impulse buying as a whole describe positive and quite significant influence. This suggests that Impulse Buying relies heavily on Intrinsic Factor and Price in consumers in purchasing decisions on the Shopee platform. 2. All variables and indicators that have been tested have valid values in the validity and reliability test as evidenced by the results of statistical values T more than 1.96 in accordance with criteria that are considered to have significant effect so that all hypotheses in this study can be accepted and tested for validity. Based on the results of the data obtained said that if there is an increase in shopping enjoyment tendency in intrinsic factor it will increase impulse buying behavior in consumers as well. In addition, the results of the data obtained mention that if the higher the materialism of consumers then of course will increase also their impulse buying behavior. Furthermore, the most dominant intrinsic factor is in terms of culture which is considered to greatly affect the level of consumer impulse buying behavior supported by the surrounding culture supported by the results of data in price variables that say that price factors are considered significant enough to affect consumer buying interest so as to cause impulse buying behavior because consumers are very interested in affordable prices and compete on other platforms that may be It can be said to trigger the emergence of a culture of hedonism in consumers.","the shopee platform risma meylia dinati, mahendra fakhri, amalina dewi kumalasari school of communication and business telkom university rismameylia@student.telkomuniversity.ac.id, mahendrafakhri@telkomuniversity.ac.id radenamalina@telkomuniversity.ac.id",
410,The Effect Of Service Quality On Customer Satisfaction And  Customer Loyalty Ovo E-Wallet Users,"technological developments that occur today, have made various companies compete with each other to create various technologies that can assist daily activities. one of these technologies is digital money or digital wallet (e-wallet) as a transaction tool. in indonesia, there are various digital money providers or digital wallets that have received permission from bank indonesia, one of which is the ovo e-wallet. due to the large number of digital wallet providers, competition is getting tougher, so creating and maintaining customer loyalty is very important so that customers remain loyal to using the service and do not switch to other similar services. this study was conducted to determine how much influence service quality has on customer satisfaction and loyalty in using ovo digital wallet services when making digital payment transactions. in addition, non-probability sampling was used in sampling and analysed using the structural equation modelling (sem) method. the tool used in managing the data that has been collected is using the smartpls software. the results obtained are service quality has a positive and significant influence on customer satisfaction and customer loyalty. so it can be concluded that good service quality can maintain and improve customer satisfaction and customer loyalty who use the ovo e-wallet in their transactions.","e-wallet, service quality, customer loyalty","Based on the results of the analysis carried out, it was found that three of the four hypotheses proposed in this study had a positive and significant influence so that they were accepted. These three hypotheses are the service quality variable which has a positive and significant effect on the customer satisfaction variable, the customer satisfaction variable which has a positive and significant influence on the customer loyalty variable, and the service quality variable which has a positive and significant influence on the customer loyalty variable mediated by the variable customer satisfaction. While the hypothesis that does not have a positive and significant effect so that it cannot be accepted or rejected is the effect of the service quality variable on the customer loyalty variable. From the results of this analysis, it can be concluded that good service quality can maintain and improve customer satisfaction in using the Ovo e-wallet to make transactions both for payments on the grab application or merchants who collaborate with Ovo. Furthermore, by maintaining customer satisfaction, it can create loyalty to customers in using Ovo services to process daily payment transactions, especially during the current covid-19 pandemic, using Ovo services can be an alternative in making payments so that it is very necessary to always improve service quality and features that make it easier for customers. In addition, in this study, filling out this questionnaire was only done by respondents who had or frequently used Ovo services to transact on the grab application or transact at merchants that collaborated with Ovo so that it was limited to only Ovo service users who filled out this research questionnaire. Furthermore, this research can be a recommendation for future research in developing other variables that may have an influence on e-wallet customer loyalty, especially the Ovo e-wallet. In addition, this research can also add insight for Ovo e-wallet service providers to continue to improve service quality and features that make it easier for customers to use Ovo services in conducting transactions so that customer loyalty is always maintained.","theresia bernadetha nariyari, mahendra fakhri, amalina dewi kumalasari, school of communication and business telkom university theresiabernadetha@student.telkomuniversity.ac.id, mahendrafakhri@telkomuniversity.ac.id, radenamalina@telkomuniversity.ac.id",
411,Smart Preventive Maintenancea Review,"the maintenance function would help extend the useful service life of a machine tool. maintenance can be broadly classified into break-down, preventive, and condition-based maintenance. this paper intends to (i) study the different techniques proposed by researchers for the maintenance of machine tools, (ii) understand their merits and limitations, (iii) identify the research gaps (iv) provide the future directions. the present research has identified that many of the techniques proposed by researchers were applied in manufacturing and electrical power distribution systems. the paper concludes that much research is required for developing preventive maintenance policies in other domains, including textiles, aerospace, defense, and machine tools manufacturing. 1. introduction many sectors, including manufacturing, have been practicing maintenance functions to extend the useful service life of a machine tool (dalenogare 2018, frank 2019, aivaliotis 2019, aivaliotis 2021, grall 2021). the maintenance function would help a company meet customers’ expectations by making machines or machine tools and equipment available most of the time. this would make the device available whenever it is required for service. this would help in enhancing the availability of machine tools. this would make a manufacturing line consistent in delivering quality products. this, in turn, would increase the manufacturing company’s reputation in front of the customer. this might result in repeat orders from the customer. this would create customer goodwill. 2. literature review the following paragraphs discuss the maintenance techniques proposed by different researchers, used by other sectors. 2.1 manufacturing a machine becomes unavailable because of multiple reasons. one reason can be the malfunctioning of a component of the machine tool. when this scenario prevails, either a device may become temporarily or permanently unavailable. this would result in unnecessary downtime till the machine becomes functional. this is going to affect the productivity of the entire manufacturing line. when a device becomes unavailable, the production manager may have to reschedule the machining of the component either when the machine becomes available or if the component has no time. the part will have to be machined on some other available machine. re-scheduling is very difficult as it would disturb the machining of other components in the line. this example signifies the importance of the maintenance of a machine tool. thus, when a machine becomes unavailable, this would not result in downtime of the concerned machine tool but would also increase the waiting time of the work-in-process as the work-in-process may have to be carried to another machine for subsequent processing. in a process layout, this would further complicate the scenario. the commonly used maintenance practice is to subject the device to maintenance when the machine becomes unavailable. this practice is known as breakdown maintenance. to overcome some of the drawbacks of breakdown maintenance, preventive care came into existence. during preventive maintenance, a machine will be subjected to scheduled maintenance. so that machine will not be available during maintenance. the production manager will decide the frequency of preventive maintenance by looking at the type of machine and the criticality of the machine. the criticality of the device will be determined by considering many factors, such as complexity, number of moving parts, size of the device, cost of machine breakdown/ or machine downtime. with the advent of industry 4.0 and artificial intelligence (ai), many researchers have proposed schemes for the maintenance of machines involving ml and ai for predicting the remaining service life of the machine proceedings of the international conference on industrial engineering and operations management istanbul, turkey, march 7-10, 2022 ieom society international 3873",,"To summarize, the maintenance function would extend the useful life of a machine tool. Different maintenance techniques are being used in industries, depending upon the criticality of the machine tool. Researchers have proposed new approaches to overcome the limitations of the existing maintenance methods. Artificial Intelligence and machine learning has been used by researchers to successfully demonstrate how smart maintenance function can reduce the total maintenance cost. 4. Future Directions: Many of the models developed for preventive maintenance have been applied in a fictitious company or case study. More research is required in assessing the preventive maintenance of a real company. Many of the models developed so far have been applied in analyzing six machines and six buffer problems. However, a real company will have more devices and buffers. Many of the techniques proposed by researchers were applied in manufacturing and Electrical power distribution systems. Much research is required for developing preventive maintenance policies in other domains.","m. b. kiran department of mechanical engineering, school of technology, pandit deendayal energy university, gandhinagar, gujarat, india mb.kiran@sot.pdpu.ac.in",

417,The Influence Of Rooftop Agriculture On Urban Food Security  In South Africa,"one out of two households in south africa experience hunger, approximately one out of three are at risk of hunger, and only one out of five seem to be food secure (drimie and mclachlan 2013). this paper analyses the influence of rooftop agriculture on urban food security using three case studies in three cities (johannesburg, cape town and durban) in south africa. this research is important as it studies a variety of rooftop gardens and farms which will help to inform policy directives as well as promote rooftop farming within cities and aid food security. the methodology used for this paper was qualitative research, based on an extensive literature review which investigated four different rooftop gardens in cities around the world. results of the research indicated that all three rooftop gardens contributed to food security and affordability, employment and business opportunities, environmental restoration and beautification into cities. in future therefore, cities need to pass legislation making rooftop agriculture a priority, or offer a tax rebate to building owners who do comply. furthermore, studies testing roof garden capacity need to be carried out in all cities.","food security, food production, employment","and recommendations There is extensive evidence of the benefits of rooftop agriculture/farms and the role that they have played in providing urban food security amongst many countries as well as in the three case studies in South Africa. Yet it is clear that this is an underutilized tool in the combat against urban food insecurity. Some of these benefits include employment and business opportunities, environmental restoration and beautification, not to mention the opportunity to bring an affordable food source into cities. The JHC for example, have proved that rooftop gardens at residences are quite beneficial as they not only act as a source of food to residents but also as a learning tool. The Two Oceans Aquarium can act as a template for other wildlife sanctuaries to produce their own food for animals. The Green Roof Pilot Project can act as a base for other businesses, schools and office buildings as they efficiently use space and informative techniques to produce food and plants that are indigenous. More studies need to be disseminated to the greater public so that building owners are made aware of the endless possibilities, and only then will huge changes be seen. South African cities have the potential to create many more rooftop gardens to aid in food security, therefore, further studies should be carried out in cities based on inspection of roof weight capacity which can inform building owners Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management Istanbul, Turkey, March 7-10, 2022 IEOM Society International 3921","kiara lawrence human sciences research council intern university of johannesburg, department of urban and regional planning, office 6062, sixth floor, john orr building, beit and siemert street, 2028. johannesburg, south africa mailto:kiaralaw20@gmail.com trynos gumbo head of department and associate professor university of johannesburg, department of urban and regional planning, office 6062, sixth floor, john orr building, beit and siemert street, 2028. johannesburg, south africa tgumbo@uj.ac.za zaakirah jeeva post-doctoral research fellow unit of environmental science and management, north-west university, potchefstroom,2520. jeeva","References

418,The Role Of Rooftop Agriculture On Urban Food Security: A  Case Study On The Priority Zone Rooftop Garden,"urban food security is a growing concern for cities, and durban, ethekwini municipality, south africa is no exception. this study explores the impact of the priority zone rooftop garden (pzrg) on urban food security in durban. qualitative interviews were conducted with stakeholders from the pzrg as well as organisations which directly benefit from the initiative. the study showed that start up and maintenance costs of the garden were minimal, and its benefits exceed its limitations. with food security being addressed through food donations and the creation of individual food gardens, the pzrg contributes to food security and is worth expanding upon. by promoting rooftop agriculture in the city of durban through the offering of incentives and enabling of by-laws, more buildings can start up initiatives like this one. rooftop agriculture has the potential to play a major role in urban food security if it is further explored on a larger scale.","food security, food production","and recommendations Urban food security is an increasing concern for cities as food has to be brought into cities from surrounding farms. The findings of this research were that there were minimal start-up and maintenance costs, food security was addressed through food donations as well as through educating those that visit the garden and through those that take what they have learnt and apply that knowledge by creating their own rooftop gardens. Limitations and benefits were discussed in-depth. For instance, the PZRG definitely contributes toward urban food security but cannot be solely relied upon. However, by promoting rooftop agriculture in the city of Durban, more buildings can start up initiatives like this one, as the benefits exceed the initial start-up costs and limitations of the garden. A simple checklist was created to direct those who wish to start their own rooftop gardens. Urban planning policies and systems can therefore directly incorporate rooftop agriculture as a strategy to aid in urban food security.

419,Improving Sustainability Of Orange Supply Chain:  A  System Dynamics Model To Eliminating Pre-Harvesting,"the agricultural supply chain plays an important role in the increasing food loss and waste (flw) due to different causes. however, this can be seen in citrus products like orange as this fruit is subject to different and critical conditions of flw especially at the farm where workers are a key factor. this paper contributes by proposing solutions to decrease orange loss before and during harvesting. consequently, this would lead to boosting food security levels. a system dynamics model was built to simulate and compare the results to the current situation. in addition, the case farm was selected for the purpose of the data collection from jordan. the proposed model enhanced sustainability performance in general since the number of workers required to cultivate the mature orange has been increased to 13 instead of 10 in the current scenario. furthermore, farmers’ profit improved by 19.5% in comparison to the current scenario because the sold orange has been increased and consequently this impacted the amount of orange loss pre- cultivation and reduced to be 9.5 tons rather than 26.09 tons in the current scenario. nevertheless, implementing the proposed model can lead to maximizing social and economic performance while maintaining the environmental impacts at a low level as the orange loss decreased significantly. further research can be done in the direction of applying circular economy and reverse logistics into the orange supply chain to integrate orange by-products and waste into an innovative logistics network to reduce the consumption of limited natural resources.","orange, system dynamics, farmer’s profit","The paper presents a case study of an orange farm in Jordan to improve orange farmers’ sustainability performance as mentioned previously. The simulation model was built using the SD approach to measure the improvement. It was found that increasing the number of workers can lead to a significant improvement in the farmer’s profit and a reduction of orange loss. For instance, 3 more workers helped in increasing the profit by 19.5% and a reduction in the orange loss by 62.6%. however, reducing the orange loss by this percentage can contribute to reducing the gap between orange supply to the domestic market the demand which influences the food security level.

421,Strategies For Developing Medical Waste Management  Interventions In Various Countries: Systematic Review,"the problem of medical waste is a national, regional, and international problem. medical waste management interventions are very important so that the waste generated is managed properly and correctly. this is because medical waste is included in the category of hazardous and toxic waste. some medical waste is included in the category of hazardous waste and some are included in the infectious category. methods: this review was conducted based on sources from google scholar, pubmed, emerald insight, doaj with the types of journals published such as elsevier, ijsdge, proceedings, iccem, hindawi, jphe, jstft, jet, ajest, jch, wmr, bmc health services research and two reports from who (world health organization). furthermore, screening of titles, abstracts, and the content selection or content according to inclusion and exclusion was carried out, which obtained 14 articles that were analyzed further. results: this review found that the strategy for developing medical waste management interventions such as training or health education is very important to increase awareness and develop skills for health workers so that they know and understand the functions and responsibilities in managing medical waste generated from health care facilities. medical waste management interventions in various countries through steps such as situation analysis (pre-intervention) conducted to assess health waste management (hwm) practices, solutions offered to minimize observed risks, and advocacy made to improve administration in health facilities where some intervention measures were developed. post-intervention is carried out to identify medical waste management efforts that have been carried out by intervention and identify locations that require attention for follow-up. conclusion: various types of medical waste produced can be dangerous and cause health problems, especially during collection, sorting, storage, storage, transportation, and destruction as well as final disposal. therefore, every country needs a strategy for developing medical waste management interventions to reduce the risk of accidents for paramedics, staff, and patients as well as the environment.","strategy, intervention, medical","Development strategy Medical waste management interventions are very important for the health of paramedics, staff and patients, and the environment. Medical waste management in developing and developed countries is different. Developed countries are oriented towards technology and sufficient budget while developing countries still use human resources and limited budgets. Therefore, health care facilities need to prepare human resources (HR) who have the system, technology, and management capabilities for medical waste management. Medical waste management must be supported by adequate human resources, organization, facilities, and budget.

425,Geo-Chemical Characterization Of Ekiti State Soils:  Implication For Road Works,"this research seeks to evaluate the geo chemical classification of ekiti state soils and examine its suitability for road works the study area was divided into three districts thus: ekiti central senatorial districts (ekiti southern senatorial districts (essd) and ekiti northern senatorial districts (ensd). a total of 480 samples were obtained with 160 samples from per districts. laboratory tests such as chemical and geotechnical test were analyzed. the results showed that soil index properties classified the soils of the ecsd into four classes as a-2-4, a-2-6, a-2-7 and a-7-5, the essd into eight as a-2-4, a-2-5, a-2-6, a-2-7, a-4, a-5, a-6 and a-7-5 while ensd were classified into six classes as a-2-4, a-2-5, a-2-6,a-2-7, a-6 and a-7-6 respectively. the chemical test showed ecsd has the purest, finest and most economically valuable clay mineral among others and also grouped the districts soils into three classes as: laterite soil, lateritic soil and non-lateritic soil. it is concluded that the soils found in the study area are adequate for civil engineering works particularly samples from ecsd while other districts will also be adequate if treated with additives to improve their geotechnical properties.",index properties,"Geo-chemical classification of Ekiti state soils: implication for road works was evaluated. A trial pit 1-2 m deep was excavated and 480 samples of undisturbed soils was obtained for laboratory tests. From the results obtained and findings the following conclusions are drawn. The studied soil samples are characterized by high proportion content of SiO2, Al2O3 and Fe2O3 and small amount of the rest oxides which also serves as impurities (associated minerals) for all the three districts’ soils. The Ekiti Central Senatorial Districts (ECSD) samples show slightest occurrence of associated minerals in contrast to Ekiti Northern Senatorial Districts (ENSD) with most content of the associated minerals. This indicates ECSD as the purest, finest and most economically valuable clay mineral among others. The Geo-chemical classification analysis reveals that Ekiti State Soils is sub divided into three types namely (Laterite soil, Lateritic soil and non-Lateritic soil). The classification shown that, Ekiti Central Senatorial Districts (ECSD) soils are predominantly lateritic soils and Ekiti South Senatorial Districts (ESSD) soils showed that the three types of soils discovered in this research work can be found in the Southern Senatorial Districts as Laterite soil, Lateritic soil and Non-Lateritic soil while Ekiti State Northern Senatorial Districts (ESNSD) has also showed that two out of the three soils discovered were found in the Northern Districts as Laterite soil and Lateritic soil. However, it is noteworthy that in terms of volume of material ESCD have the highest follow by ESSD while ESND has the lowest quantity of lateritic soil conversely, this research also established the ESNSD has the highest volume of laterite soil followed by ESSD while ESCSD has none. Also, this research has shown that only ESSSD has the third type of soil, non-Lateritic soil.The research has shown data obtained and applied in this work in the development of Geo-based map for Ekiti State Senatorial districts soils as well as analysis performed through specific tools for information manipulation.It’s concluded that the Geo-chemical database developed will allow geographical understanding of geology, lithology, pedology, and declivity, as well as geotechnical mapping, thus in-forming geotechnical engineering properties of subsurface soils for many uses in the planning and execution of engineering services within the study area.","akinwamide joshua tunbosun department of civil engineering, faculty of engineering the federal polytechnic ado ekiti, ekiti state, nigeria akinwamidejoshua2@gmail.com jacob odeh ehiorobo, ph.d., osuji sylvester obinna. ph. d. and ebuka nwankwo. ph.d. department of civil engineering, faculty of engineering university of benin benin city, edo state, nigeria jacehi@uniben.edu, osujisyl@yahoo.com, ebuka.nwankwo@uniben.edu",

427,Implementing Deep Learning In E-Commerce Platforms For  Fraud Detection And Management,"e-commerce has quickly become an essential facet of business transactions within the past decade as online platforms have paved the way towards convenient shopping that does not require the consumer to invest time and resources in traveling to the physical location of businesses. along with the utilization of digital platforms to exchange goods, this also introduced the integration of digital payment methods such as e-wallets and credit cards. the use of fraud detection systems seeks to accurately filter and detect any malicious transactions that use unverified or illegitimate payment details. this paper aims to conduct a systematic literature review that will analyze collected academic papers from 2017 to 2021, which focus and relate to various deep learning techniques used in model creation. the findings from the systematic review will be used to develop and conceptualize a system that will utilize an efficient deep- learning method towards accurate fraud detection.",e-commerce,"With the e-commerce industry rapidly developing and being more utilized, a detection system that determines whether a transaction is fraudulent or not is essential. E-commerce companies can implement and use the proposed model to identify transactions deemed fraud by the system based on the similarities of previous fraudulent transactions. The implications are presented using the data gathered and the data of related studies. 5.1 Practical Implication Correct transactions are vital in satisfaction and providing better services to the consumers of an e-commerce platform. Because fraudulent transactions often use other people's identities, it can pose a severe threat to the privacy of people who got their identities stolen, leaving their identities vulnerable. The proposed system can stop the transaction from proceeding, preventing the breach of confidentiality from occurring. Implementing the fraud detection system could improve consumer satisfaction as their personal information is kept safe from being misused. An effective fraud detection system is beneficial for the employees of an e-commerce company, as they are the people that take responsibility for instances of fraudulent transactions. A fraud detection system can eliminate the fear of large and suspicious transactions, increasing employees' productivity and better engagements with e-commerce platforms. 5.2 Theoretical Implication Previous research identified how fraud detection systems operate in preventing occurrences of fraudulent transactions. It was proven that fraud detections systems are essential in commerce, especially those that are conducted online. However, those researches focused on card transactions. E-commerce does not only use cards for transactions but other digital financial technology services. Ensuring that e-commerce is the field concentrated, the study and development of the proposed model provides a detailed explanation of behavioral similarities, additional information in online banking, and using deep learning in constructing detection systems, which is significant in the framework followed for this study. The increase in fraudulent transactions in e-commerce platforms is prevalent, rising from 43% to 48% in 2020. Fraud detection systems are significant in maintaining satisfactory and efficient delivery of services in e-commerce platforms. By understanding patterns and the current situation of e-commerce in dealing with fraudulent transactions, this study proposes a model that identifies fraudulent transactions using deep learning. Through the data of previous studies and similarities, the effectiveness is verified. The verification proves that using systems specializing in fraud detection is possible and is beneficial for e-commerce. If implemented, deep learning in fraud detection systems for e-commerce will serve as helpful in increasing the efficiency, reliability, and improvement in the experience of the utilization of e-commerce. 4023","mary jane c. samonte doctor in information technology faculty member of school of information technology mapua university, makati city, philippines mjcsamonte@yahoo.com elcid a. serrano doctor in information technology faculty member of school of information technology mapua university, makati city, philippines easerrano@mapua.edu.ph joseph anthony t. arpilleda, robert leyton-pete j. pastrana dhan l. quijano, romeo robert r. sulit school of information technology, mapua university makati city, philippines, jatarpilleda@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, rljpastrana@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, dlquijano@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, rrrsulit@mymail.mapua.edu.ph","References

It was shown that using an LSTM model combined with CNN and an attention mechanism shows superior performance compared to a standalone LSTM model (Zheng et al. 2020). It was also shown in the studies of Essien et al. (2020) and Jia et al. (2017), that using more datasets leads to better prediction accuracy, which is why the researchers believe that the proposed model should use both environmental data and data from social media. Instead of using other models such as a DBN or a GRU-based model, we chose an LSTM based model because it performed better than a DBN-based model (Jia et al. 2017) and 4033","mary jane c. samonte doctor in information technology faculty member of school of information technology mapua university, makati city, philippines mjcsamonte@yahoo.com gian andre f. balan, paolo p. gaviño, justin angelo s. monasterial, rafael antonio c. reforsado, danielle c. samonte school of information technology, mapua university makati city, philippines, gafbalan@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, ppgavino@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, jasmonasterial@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, racreforsado@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, dcsamonte@mymail.mapua.edu.ph","References

E-commerce strategists underlined the necessity that hotels have reservation websites and that it is important to know how a website attracts and promotes online reservations. The website would lead to an efficient information collection procedure to enable customers to get answers without much difficulty, thereby decreasing the waiting time for responses to be sent as soon as they need them. The website would also allow customers to validate which room has been reserved to ensure no errors during the booking or reservations. In addition, it would also provide the customer with an efficient way of browsing through the Hotel's room rates, amenities, and services. The website features a contact page where the customers can quickly contact the Hotel. On this page, a map, telephone number, and email address of the Hotel are provided for the customers' guidance. The website also features a FAQs page where customers can see the list of common questions asked about the Hotel. The website has become more efficient as it can deal with the customers' particular queries regarding the Hotel. Aside from the FAQs page, the website also features the reviews and feedbacks of the customers that the Hotel has received over the years. Lastly, the creation of this website will act as the compilation of the features and requirements that were found through the initial analysis. This compilation of features paves the way to the increased efficiency of the business through most of the automated customer-end actions. This increase in efficiency can be seen through the proposed business process modeling notation that is presented.

435,Exploring And Evaluating The Impact Of Covid-19 On  Mobility Changes In Singapore,"this paper analyzes the changes in mobility trends due to the impact of the covid-19 pandemic in singapore in the six different sectors: retail and recreation, grocery and pharmacy, parks, transit stations, workplaces and residential. the period of observation is from 15 february 2020 to 18 august 2021. the observed patterns obtained from the descriptive data analysis sheds light on the effectiveness of social distancing measures in singapore as well as the level of compliance among the country’s residents. correlation analysis is used to explore the relationship between different sectors during the pandemic period. the results reveal a strong sense of compliance with government policies and personal responsibility to social distance. we establish that the transit stations sector, and retail and recreation sector are two of the most sensitive sectors to mobility changes, while grocery and pharmacy sector is the most unaffected one as it is considered as a necessity during the pandemic.","covid-19, singapore, mobility","The paper has addressed its objectives of exploring, investigating and evaluating the impact of Covid-19 on mobility changes in six sectors in Singapore as well as their relationships from 15 February 2020 to 18 August 2021. With the peak mobility increase for Residential and peak mobility decrease for rest of the sectors during CB, evidence supports that Singapore residents are following social distancing measures. Moreover, the gradual mobility change, decreased towards 0 from Phase One to Phase Three, reflects the easing of COVID-19 measures as well as people resuming to the new normal mobility. Correlation analysis is used to explore the linear relationship between different sectors over the pandemic period as well as their relationships within each phase. As observed over all phases, Transit Stations and Retail and Recreation are two of the most sensitive to mobility changes. This is because they have the highest correlation coefficient ranks, meaning that a mobility change in other sectors would result in an equally large change in these two sectors.

436,Optimizing Of Series Systems With Identical   Components And Imperfect Repairs,"the objective of this research is to determine the optimal solution to a series repairable system subjected to random failure. any failed system can be repaired in one of three categories: perfect, minimal, and imperfect. in this article, we address the problem of systems undergoing imperfect repair after each failure. in addition to optimal system availability and minimum cost, closed analytical expressions for the various parameters are derived. key words: optimization, availability, kuhn tucker conditions, series systems, imperfect repair, 1 introduction buildings, machines, roads, cars, and power plants, among other human-made structures, are prone to malfunction and failure, demanding maintenance and repair in order to function optimally or acceptably. maintenance optimization is a term that refers to mathematical models that are used to discover the optimal balance between decreasing maintenance costs and maximizing benefits. the literature has looked into the optimization of mechanical systems availability is a result of not just dependability, but also maintainability and supportability. in this paper, we look at the best behaviour of two variants of a series of repairable systems with identical components, assuming that the failure rate increases with each random failure. another assumption is that repair times and times between failures are exponentially distributed, that travel time from and to the repair station is insignificant, and that placing a replacement component into operation takes time. 1.1 objective the study's major objective is to develop and an optimization model for a series repairable system with identical components that is imperfectly repaired. second, derive the ideal parameter expressions, such as repair and failure rates, as well as a closed expression for the optimal solution. 2.1 literature review based on exponentially distributional failure and repair time system, wolde and ghobbar (2013) examined inspection problems associated with railway carrier. historical failure and repair data were jointly used is in order to find the optimal interval inspection with minimum costs and maximum availability. li et al (2018) inspected the viability of the maintenance scheme used by a multicomponent production system. the system is assumed to deteriorate over time and ultimately fail. the objective was to find the most cost-effective maintenance policy. meanwhile; hajipour and taghipour (2016) proposed a model for two types of multicomponent repairable (hard-type and soft-type components) systems with the objective of finding the optimal no periodic inspection interval. volf (2021) was concerned with maximizing a technical device's preventative maintenance program. the main objective is to develop a model for determining the device's optimal life time while minimizing maintenance expenses. lin et al. (2022) designed a multicomponent model optimization reliability model under s-dependent competing risks. the goal is to find the best reliability threshold as well as the best number of pm cycles at the lowest total predicted maintenance cost rate. zhao et al. (2021) examined the performance of a cold standby system with two components that are subjected to δ -shocks and imperfect repairs and had varied reliability characteristics. under shocks and incomplete repairs, geometric process models are used to characterize the lifetime and repair time. to quantify the system's economic performance, an equation for the long-run cost per unit time is also generated. for a two-unit series system. zhang et al (2022) developed a combination optimization problem of condition-based maintenance policy and buffer capacity for a two-unit series system in their work. the semi-markov process was used to examine the probabilities of the system's proceedings of the international conference on industrial engineering and operations management istanbul, turkey, march 7-10, 2022 ieom society international 4116",,"and Future Directions Availability, reliability, and maintainability are key performance indicators for determining the fitness and resilience of operational systems. These characteristics are concurrently important as the cost. The expressions of the optimal parameters for a single repair system with imperfect repaid have been derived in this research effort. These expressions are generic and can be used event in perfect repair situation. The overall cost of a reparable system is a function of failure rate, repair rate, and availability, as these represent constituents of the cost function. In the analysis, it is observed that at lower levels of availability, the total cost of a single component system changes very minimally, but it surges at values of 0.90 and beyond. Contrastingly, the cost is highest at low failure rates and decreases as the failure rate rises. We recommend that future research ought to investigate standby, and parallel systems as well as systems with other distributions.",mohammed a. hajeeh techno-economics division kuwait institute for scientific research p.o. box 24885; safat-13109 kuwait mhajeeh@kisr.edu.kw; http://www.kisr.edu.kw,
437,A Structured Method For Requirements Analysis  With Application To Cfr-14 Part-21 Subpart-G,"standards are the bottleneck of any aviation industrial action. thus, meeting standards is not an option but an obligation throughout a given product life cycle. the implementation of the standards and the evaluation process are complicated and need considerable resources. simultaneously, extra costs and concerns may be imposed on the aviation industry due to improper requirements. thus, the quality of standards should be comprehensively assessed to obtain a satisfactory final result. system engineering introduces requirement analysis to solve this problem. as a significant contribution, this paper provides a method of requirement analysis based on the structured strategy. the criteria were defined practically. diagram, process, sub-process, and techniques including rtm and wbs were either developed or deployed to investigate the conformance of requirements with the criteria. applying this method, any sort of requirement is evaluated accurately. plus, it shows a specific and root cause of the problems if the requirement is unacceptable. furthermore, a novel way to measure system affordability is proposed through the application of dfmea. lastly, the model is applied on cfr-14 part-21 subpart-g (faa production organization requirements) to show the need for systematic improvement of aviation standards’ requirements of production organization.",system engineering,"As an effective method, system and requirement engineering was chosen to evaluate the quality of the requirements. Several strategies to conduct requirements analysis were studied. As a result, the best of them, the structured strategy was followed to take further steps. There are a couple of other actions to take when it comes to system engineering methodology. However, the central concern of this paper is the requirements analysis. Thus, requirement analysis was conducted to investigate whether the requirements were acceptable or not. No matter how well-designed the system is, there is no guarantee that a system may meet the requirements and the final result would be satisfactory unless the requirements’ quality is acceptable. Studies have provided seven essential attributes as the most comprehensive criteria to evaluate the quality of requirements, including complete, hierarchy, need, unambiguity, consistency, verifiability, and achievability. Diagrams, processes, and sub-processes are defined and developed to provide a method that turns this theory into practical work. This detailed solution allows applying an engineering response to this problem instead of a freestyle strategy of requirement analysis, which may not be accurate and precise. A requirement traceability matrix is formed to organize and trace the requirements from beginning to end. An Excel file contains all information pertaining to requirements ranging from WBS to requirements analysis attributes. Because of the influential role of FAA in the aviation industry, we collected the data set from CFR-14 Part 21 subpart G and transferred it to an RTM. Sixteen national codes were decomposed into sixty-five items, which provided a more understandable and logical analysis. Thereafter, analysis was conducted. Based on the proposed method, the data set was analyzed, and the details on each item and its results were mentioned in the RTM. The analysis consisted of various steps and sub-processes, including WBS and DFME. According to the analysis results, 92% of sixty-five items are not acceptable, including sixty items. It shows an opportunity for improvement to reach an acceptable level of quality when it comes to this code of regulation. Meanwhile, interfaces of the requirements with all internal and external entities were investigated. This investigation results in a building block diagram showing how the requirements depend on the other requirements and standards. In addition, it depicts how complicated they are to be met. Based on the analysis result, CFR-14 Part 21 subpart G needs a plan of improvement. This plan should include the improvement of the process of rulemaking as well. The method proposed by this paper provides the possibility to systematically approach the requirement analysis and prevent problematic requirements by improving the process of rulemaking.

In general, the tutor participants felt that they had basic knowledge of non-formal education. Their conception of the written table was mostly positive, with the assumption that writing can help improve writing skills. The teaching participants also tried to provide institutions, but faced several obstacles. In short, the teaching participants in this study reported having a basic understanding, but with a need to increase the knowledge base and practice of education. Furthermore, the participants were said to be not reflective about how to make use of the results of the services that were managed and written learning. Among so many kinds of products and samples made, educators are required to be careful in determining the right system. Using services to measure outcomes is the first step in improving the quality of education. The results of the study found that the alignment of curriculum and curriculum is very important. The success of improving the quality of district education is largely in the practice of appropriate inspection and examination. In formulating education standards, the government continues to strive to suit the needs of education in line with and adapted to learning needs and needs. The development of children's skills and knowledge that prioritizes the process and mastery of understanding has now become the attention and priority of education actors.

441,Students’ Perception Of Online Discussion During The Covid19 Pandemic,"this research aimed to describe students' perceptions of online discussion and to find out the correlation between (1) motivation as well as enjoyability and students' perceptions of online discussions, and (2) lecturers' roles and students' perceptions of online discussions. this study employed descriptive quantitative and correlation methods. a total of 91 students were selected as participants through a purposive sampling technique. the findings of this study indicated that students had positive perceptions of online discussion. students agreed that online discussion could improve language skills, enhance skills in drawing conclusions, encourage useful social interactions, facilitate idea sharing between students and lecturers, and broaden their knowledge. however, some of the participants doubted that online discussions could motivate them to continue learning and that online discussions could make the discussion materials interesting to study. the role of lecturers in encouraging the effectiveness of online discussions was fairly correlated with students' perceptions. on the other hand, the role of lecturers had a weak correlation with motivation, meaning that the presence of lecturers in online discussions did not stimulate students' desire to study hard. it could be concluded that students had a positive perception of the use of online discussion methods, but they still showed doubts in terms of learning motivation and enjoyability in participating in online discussions.","online discussion, perception, connectivity, flexibility","In general, the students had a good perception of online discussion. They agreed that online discussions could improve their language skills, enhance skills in drawing conclusions, serve as a useful social interaction, facilitate opinion sharing between students and lecturers, and broaden knowledge. From the results of this study, it was concluded that the students felt the benefits of learning that was carried out using the online discussion method. However, they still had doubts regarding their motivation and enjoyability during online discussions. These findings were related to several factors such as a bad internet connection which caused obstacles in joining the discussion properly, lack of understanding of the topic being discussed, and lack of practices in self-regulated learning. Lecturers’ roles were fairly correlated with students’ perception of online discussion; however, these roles showed a weak correlation with motivation and enjoyability in learning. This fact indicated that the presence of the lecturers in online discussions did not play a significant role in motivating the students to learn and in encouraging them to enjoy the topic being discussed. In creating a virtual learning environment, the presence of lecturers in the online discussion has contributed to the process of forming students’ learning perceptions. Therefore, reflective teaching is very much needed to be implemented at the end of the learning process, and lecturers are encouraged to give solutions to the problems encountered by the students during the learning process.","ghina aulia abidin and ali mustadi faculty of education yogyakarta state university yogyakarta, indonesia ghinaaulia.2019@student.uny.ac.id, ghinaauliaabidin@gmail.com, ali_mustadi@uny.ac.id heri retnawati faculty of mathematics and natural science yogyakarta state university yogyakarta, indonesia heri_retnawati@uny.ac.id",

In the aspect of language suitability, a score of 25 (very decent) was obtained, while in the dictionary or glossary aspect, a score of 11 was obtained (very decent). But in addition to providing scores, linguists also provide a number of recommendations as well as material experts. Therefore, AR-assisted textbooks were declared very suitable for use with some improvements according to the recommendations of linguists. Similar to the assessment of textbook materials, the feasibility of AR-based textbooks as media is considered ""appropriate"", with a number of improvements according to recommendations from media experts. This conclusion was obtained based on the assessment of media experts (Table 3). In terms of appearance, obtained a score of 33 (decent). Meanwhile, in terms of accuracy, usefulness, AR effect, a score of 10 (adequate), 9 (less feasible), and 11 (feasible) were obtained, respectively. From the point of view of the AR effect, the textbooks developed were considered inadequate. But overall, media experts stated that this textbook was suitable for use in learning. Of course, with some improvements made according to the recommendations of media experts first. In addition to referring to the theory that AR applications can motivate, improve understanding of concepts and learning achievement, experts (material, language, and media experts), teacher and student responses also provide the ""Appropriate"" category to AR-assisted textbooks. This view is strengthened by the results of research showing the Hotelling Trace test results are 0.000 < 0.05, so it can be concluded that there is a significant difference between understanding the concept and the character of love for the homeland between students who use AR-assisted textbooks and students who do not use textbooks. AR assisted. So that based on the results of these trials, it can be concluded that there is an increase in the character of patriotism. 6.

Further, an intrarater reliability test was performed to check the reliability of the appraisal. The systematic literature review of the articles published in 2000 or later yielded 17 articles finally. These articles reveal that although financial aid reduction has not shown any significant effect, cuts in state appropriations have increased tuition fees, the total cost of education, and part-time faculty; and decreased the number of patents awarded and student graduation rate at public institutions. The results of this study will serve as a foundation to understand how past studies were conducted to quantify the effects of state budget cuts on various variables at public higher education institutions. This will also prepare and provide a direction to all stakeholders at public institutions to face the budget cuts as an aftermath of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The existing literature has not focused on using the latest information technologies, such as data analytics and machine learning, to study publicly available higher education data to understand the impact of state budget cuts.

459,Tool Condition Monitoring-A Review  M. B. Kiran,"the condition of the tool is the most significant factor in the manufacture of a quality product. manufacturing a product involves different cutting tools, and the tool will wear out during product manufacturing. using a worn-out tool would result in the formation of the defective product. thus monitoring of cutting tools assumed special significance. many researchers have been contributing techniques for tool wear measurement. an attempt has been made in this paper (i) for exploring the literature for the different tool wear monitoring techniques, (ii) advantages and limitations of the different techniques, (iii) research gaps, and to provide directions for future research. finally, the paper concludes that much research is required in the design and development of methods using the application of machine learning and artificial intelligence for achieving accuracy, robustness, and economy in tool condition monitoring. this would help improve the reliability of the machine tool and help deliver quality products to the customer.","flank wear, crater wear","and direction for future research. Many researchers have been contributing to the techniques for evaluating the dve of sensors, and researchers have proposed methods by using sensors such as proximity sensors, accelerometers, etc. The indirect measurement method of tool wear assessment is relatively cheaper than the direct method. But natural methods are more accurate in predicting tool wear. The vision method shows potential for the evaluation of tool wear. Vision technique has been successfully used for the tool wear assessment. Many researchers have studied tool wear in online and post-process means. Many researchers have used turning tools for predicting tool wear. More research is required to assess tool wear in other manufacturing processes. Much research is needed for the in-process inspection of tool wear. Improvement in tool wear measurement accuracy and repeatability require more attention by researchers. Very few researchers have used artificial neural network-based techniques to assess tool wear. Much research is needed in the area of tool wear simulation. Many of these techniques are limited to the laboratory environment. Thus, there is a requirement to design and develop robust tool wear assessment techniques, which could be deployed in the industrial environment.

460,Cost Integration Value Stream Approach  To Eliminate Waste In Crankcase,"crankcase production (cp, is a nickname) is a company engaged in manufacturing, one of which produces one component of the engine motor unit, namely the crankcase component. the crankcase product is the product with the highest demand, which is around 5,000 sets per month. in the production process, there are still various indications of waste that cause a decrease in the efficiency and effectiveness of the production process. one of the biggest problems is defects, with a percentage of defects above 5%. moreover, the actual monthly production results from the crankcase machining process have not been able to reach the target set by the company. therefore, it is necessary to optimize the machining process of the crankcase to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of production. this study aims to eliminate waste in the production line of crankcase machining by implementing the lean manufacturing concept. the lean manufacturing method used is the waste assessment model (wam) to distinguish waste in the manufacturing process and value stream analysis tools (valsat) to select the mapping tool used in the waste analysis. the cost integration value stream introduces cost lines that can help facilitate decision-making. results based on the analysis obtained three recommendations for improvement: modification of the face and boring designs, application of the sampling method to the leak test process, and incorporation of the washing process.",lean manufacturing,,"production line imam rendi pratama program study magister management technology school of interdisciplinary management and technology institut teknologi sepuluh nopember surabaya, indonesia imamrendip@gmail.com moses laksono singgih professor in department of industrial and systems engineering faculty of industrial technology and systems engineering institut teknologi sepuluh nopember surabaya, indonesia moseslsinggih@ie.its.ac.id",
461,A Structural Equation Model On Relationship Between  Workers’ Performance And Their Five Factor Personality In,"there is a wide variety of assembly tasks in manufacturing industries, the performance of workers depends largely on their aptitude. in order to improve workers’ performance, some factories have applied social comparison theory to prompt workers to compete against each other so as to raise workers’ motivation towards assembly tasks. in our previous study, we designed a laboratory experiment of cell production to investigate the effect of competition among workers. based on the experiment result from 72 workers, we have clarified that the work efficiency could be increased by averagely 20% through announcing the workers with the shortest and the longest assembly time, as well as the rank for each worker every 15 to 20 minutes. we have further clarified that the comparison direction has significant influence on the workers’ performance, and the downward comparison could improve the work efficiency by about 2% compared with the upward comparison. as there is a lack of researches on the effect of social comparison on workers’ performance for assembly tasks, this study intends to fill this gap in the literature through clarifying the psychological mechanism of how workers’ personality and social comparison orientation affect their performance in the case of downward social comparison, and making the following contributions: (1) this study design and conduct an experiment of assembly operations and use the assembly time to quantitatively measure a worker’s performance. this is different from most previous research that applied questionnaire survey or case study methods to assess work performance subjectively. (2) although many companies have applied social comparison theory to prompt workers to compete against each other and realized empirically that the social comparison can improve workers’ performance, almost all of them conduct social comparisons according to the supervisors’ experience or intuition, there is no research published to consider the best utilization of social comparisons. this paper is the first attempt to examine how workers’ personality affect their performance in the case of downward social comparison, and provide some key points to conduct social comparisons more effectively. (3) this study applies five factor personality questionnaire (ffpq) scores to measure workers’ personality and uses the iowa–netherlands comparison orientation measure (incom) to measure the social comparison orientation of workers. then, we build a structural equation model, and places our emphasis on clarifying the psychological mechanism of how workers’ personality and social comparison orientation affect their performance.","workers’ aptitude, social comparison, turkey",,"the case of downward social comparison yanwen dong cluster of science and technology fukushima university fukushima city, japan dong@sss.fukushima-u.ac.jp jiali du graduate school of symbiotic systems sciences and technology, fukushima university fukushima city, japan s2070033@ipc.fukushima-u.ac.jp",
462,The Economics Of Energy Label In The Consumer Market In  Malaysia,"energy efficiency labels are commonly used tools to reduce the energy uses for household appliances for many countries around the world. the energy label targets to fight climate change, protect the environment, and supports sustainable development goals (sdgs). this paper demonstrates the implementations and developments of energy label in malaysia. energy label entails the continuous and prolonged efforts and insights towards finding a balance between social welfare, economic development, and environmental impact. in addition, energy label information and the opinions of people around as external factors are also affecting the purchase intention. interestingly, the energy consumption growth remained below the gdp growth rate. it is an effective approach to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, save consumers’ electricity bills in the long run and reduce the dependence on fossil fuel. through energy label, companies are encouraged to develop and invest in energy-efficient product design. the energy commission (ec) issued energy label to manufactures that fulfil energy performance tests, standards, and requirements started development of implementation energy label in malaysia. the main goal of energy label is to enable consumers to choose products that consume less energy and save money. additionally, energy label is among several initiatives implemented by the government to support energy efficiency agenda in malaysia. furthermore, a great sense of accountability demonstrated with energy label will influence the private and public sectors to adopt energy-efficient behavior when making decisions. this study offers implication of energy label from the sides of policy makers, and consumers, whereas the implementation of the label in the country is significant to support the sdgs.","appliance, energy efficient, energy label, energy saving","Energy label entails the continuous and prolonged efforts and insights towards finding a balance between social welfare, economic development, and environmental impact. Consumers’ knowledge on energy label posits a significant role in lessening the global carbon emissions. Mismatching information between sellers and buyers may hinder the objectives of energy label and to decide what is best in making purchasing decisions. Sellers should be able to create value, have extensive knowledge about electrical appliances and understand and certain brands’ capabilities. Meanwhile, buyers expect the sellers to cater their unique needs. Thus, the unique information about number of energy stars stated on the label can give a clear picture about energy-efficient appliances. This can assist the consumers to gauge which models or brands of electrical appliances consume a lot of electricity. And they can make plan for their budget before purchase the appliances. In addition, the energy label targets to fight climate change, protect the environment and able to achieve Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 7, 12 and 13. The implementation of energy label on selected household appliances should be comprised and supported by the citizens to ensure the energy-saving agendas are achieved. Furthermore, the government has portrayed its effort in promoting energy efficiency as stated in 12th Malaysia Plan which is focusing on energy efficiency and conservation to regulate energy consumption. Cooperation between both parties is effective if the main objective of energy efficiency can be achieved and can reduce the environmental impacts.

The inventory levels are governed by some random fluctuations. The production units, warehouses and demands are considered in different ways. Firstly, the process of production and storing occurs at a single source and then the products are distributed in the various segments. Secondly, the processes are carried in the respective segments. Two different cases for the demand rate function are taken and a numerical example is taken to illustrate a special case. The stochastic versions of these models increase their applicability as they can reflect the real-life problems in a more effective manner.","sunita mehta department of mathematics, aias, amity university, noida, u.p.-201301, india sunitasharmav78@gmail.com shivani bali jaipuria institute of management, noida, uttar pradesh-201309, india lbsshivani@gmail.com kuldeep chaudhary department of mathematics, aias, amity university, noida, u.p.-201301, india chaudharyiitr33@gmail.com",

465,Employing Smart Pre -Screening Technology In Recruiting Sales  Interns In The It Industry Of Sri Lanka,"this study will discuss about perceptions of online smart screening technology in the domain of entry level sales occupations in it domain of sri lanka. although sri lanka belongs to the late majority region of the adoption curve in terms of recruitment technologies, the growth of it sector has paved way for a greater amount of job opportunities ultimately making pre-screening a challenging task. this research demonstrates the theoretical background of the topic, and it shows the present situation of the recruitment domain with primary and secondary data. the primary research contains, the result of the conducted questionnaire with a sample of 5 it companies and from 80 individuals who work as entry level sales employees in it companies. also, this study contains 3 in-depth interviews with selected human resource heads , who elaborated their opinions about the issues they face due to the traditional prescreening system. key words facial recognition, emotional intelligence, recruitment, pre- screening, sentiment analysis. 1. introduction recruitment of interns is a common problem across most of the enterprises in sri lanka. particularly hr functions are face numerous hardships in the selection of sales interns to the organization. below are the major problems faced by hr departments when recruiting sales interns. a. excessive time consumption time consumption during the recruitment processes has always been a drawback in the traditional recruitment process practiced by organizations(sandanayake et al., 2018; alessandro, 2021) various kinds of recruitment stages such as pre-assessment, interviews and personality analysis consumes more time in the recruitment process which delays the onboarding by a significant amount of time (kumari et al., 2021). in addition, studies have also revealed that sorting out applications manually consumes more time for recruiters to finalize their decision(sharma and malik, 2018; alessandro, 2021). optimization of the selection process would positively affect the hr value chain creating efficiency and additional time to complete the remaining/other functions within the hr department. b. inability to source skillful candidates organizations focus more on the recruitment of skilled and qualified candidates in order to survive in a highly competitive environment (sharma and malik, 2018). studies show that the current recruitment processes followed by organizations are not sufficient to assess the skill set of sales candidates (harrolle et al., 2018). in most instances, recruiters find it difficult to analyze the soft skills and social skills of candidates to make their final decision. further studies say that the required skill set of a candidate has been evolving over time, communication skills, soft skills, technical skills, and personality traits are looked into at present in terms of recruitment(oksanen, 2018). studies have proven that customer facing sales skills, personality and communication act as a major component in the selection criteria. (deeter-schmelz et al., 2020). c. lack of genuineness in candidates studies reveal that candidates are more prone to cheat during prescreening activities such as online assessments (chandler and paolacci, 2017; kumari et al., 2021). due to lack of monitoring in the services provided by the existing proceedings of the international conference on industrial engineering and operations management istanbul, turkey, march 7-10, 2022 ieom society international 4359",,,"thivvyan karuneswaran1 informatics institute of technology, colombo, sri lanka thivvyan.2018352@iit.ac.lk gayashini shyanka ratnayake2 informatics institute of technology, colombo, sri lanka gayashini.r@iit.ac.lk","References

R2s indicates that emotional support and informational support contribute for 57% in the need for relatedness. Emotional support, ,informational support, .and the .need for relatedness contribute for 32% in user’s satisfaction. Figure 2. Hypothesis Test Result In this study, the author investigated the effect of emotional support. and informational support. on the need for relatedness. and user’s satisfaction on Clubhouse. The model was empirically tested through a survey method. The hypothesis testing procedure was used PLS-SEM to test both the measurement model and the structural model at the same time. A summary of the hypothesis testing is provided in Figure 2. The study investigated the effect of emotional support on the need for relatedness. The result found that emotional support have a positive effect and significant to need for relatedness. These findings supported in Self-Determination Theory from Deci and Ryan (2014b), people believe that other social media users are allowed to give advice, and listen to their problem. Figure 2 also exposes the effect of informational support on need for relatedness. The result found that informational support have a positive effect and significant to need for relatedness. It confirms Hajli (2014), that Through the social support they provide on the internet, informational support influences the need for relatedness as part of a business creation process for users, and people use social media to share their expertise, information, and experiences with their friends and societies. Lastly, the study investigated the effect of need for relatedness to user’s satisfaction. The result found that need for relatedness have a positive effect and significant to user’s satisfaction. These findings verifies in Xi and Hamari (2019), that social networking with other users can satisfy the need for relatedness by providing the user in creating social interactions with others. When users place a higher level of relatedness needs, they often desire to interact more with other participants to get the most of their use of the platform. Through virtual citizenship, successful social media enables people to engage in social networking behaviors that meet some of their most basic psychological needs. 5. Conclusion Being part of community and interacting socially with other individuals are basic human instincts. Social media have revolutionized the way people communicate. This study focused on Self Determination Theory (SDT) on the marketing track and social media perform web applications. The main purpose is to determine the social media benefits that provide for businesses and consumers. The suggested model focuses into the direct effects of emotional support on need for relatedness, informational support on need for relatedness, and need for relatedness on user's satisfaction. The result suggested that emotional support has a big impact on a person's need for relatedness when using social media. When having difficulties some people expect other user’s to support them and listened to them while they talk about their private feelings and people are concern about their well-being.

467,Special Economic Zones (Sezs) Establishments: Lessons  From International Experiences For South Africa,"for the past decade, there has been a massive development of special economic zones (sezs) in the world and south africa. the increase in the number of sezs has not impacted the integration of the south africa development community (sadc) as witnessed in asia. why other regions leverage on sezs as a tool for regional integration, south africa and africa are not doing the same. this paper examines the literature review through the conceptual synopsis and the used qualitative analysis statistical method tool to reveal the data needed. its qualitative methodology reveals the information on sez experiences of developed, developing, transitional, africa, south africa and current trends. in exploring the experiences, gaps are identified and new knowledge is developed on leveraging sezs as a catalyst for integration of a regional bloc (south african development community). the paper evaluates sez experiences in order to find ideas for integration of south african development community (sadc) that could lead to free flow of goods and services. the experience highlights that south africa sezs do not consider regional bloc integration through their sez plans and establishments. this could be aligned to weak strategies and policy developments. the examination of the experiences also broadens the knowledge of sez infrastructural planners, and managers in sadc to begin to treat sezs’ knowledge as they treat any other infrastructure and economic element of the urban realm. it calls for a shift from the current “plan- demanded” mode of segregated sez for country’s development to regional block integration for the benefits of sustainable development.","integration, transportation, region","and Recommendations SEZs' significant challenges in Africa, including South Africa, have infrastructural challenges, particularly in transport infrastructures such as roads, railways, and cargo airports. The inter-trade within Africa is poor. It limits the engagement or exportation and importation of goods within Africa countries. The limited inter-Africa trade could be linked to limited industrialisation in Africa when compared to other regions. While other regions are anchored their SEZ towards integration within South East Asia and South America, Africa SEZ are mainly focused on the local economy and regional integration within the same country. Many SEZs in Asia and North America are aligned with institutions, services providers and research institutes. It gives SEZs in Asia and other areas privilege for skill development which is limited in Africa. It also contributes to the lack of integration promoting Africa agenda 63. SEZ is leveraged to encourage the development of a disadvantaged region in Europe and South America. The free flow of goods and services in the EU has the backing of policies through removing restrictions, and most EU SEZs are developed with EU policies in mind. Another engaging learning from SEZ in South America is the City of Knowledge SEZ that thrives on education, training, research and development (R&D) and innovation services. The zone provides business services, commercial services, shopping malls and residential developments. Interestingly, some SEZs have developed into smart cities or big towns rather than isolated areas of concentration of industries. Therefore, strategically special economic zones should be planned towards a smart city not as an isolated industrial park or economic zone. SEZs can become a strategic development plan for regional integration through proper planning that include policy development, strategies and land use developments. The integration could be achieved by enhancing backwards and forward linkages which fast-track transport infrastructure transformation regionally. It is crucial to integrate SEZ into the regional blocs and national economy rather than an isolated national development. It provides significant opportunities for regional bloc integration through knowledge sharing, innovation, skills development and free movement of goods and services. The regional integration of countries’ economies, inclusive trade and investment policy depends on maximising export processing zones (FIAS 2008). The study by Leong (2013) shows the role of SEZs in liberalising China and India economies that lead to a rise in economic growth and regional integration. The review of the special economic zones experiences indicate the importance of multi-model logistic hubs, where all transport models are synergised, and tenants could consider the best for their goods and services.

469,Service Recovery In Online Travel Agencies During Covid19 Pandemic,"studies about service recovery in the tourism industry have become prevalent as tourism is highly exposed to service failures. the covid-19 pandemic was an unprecedented situation that required massive service recovery efforts by the travel and tourism industry. this study aims to look into the influence of the justice variables of service recovery, namely distributive justice, procedural justice, and interactional justice, on customer satisfaction, brand image, and customer loyalty of online travel agencies (otas), as the current fast-growing sector of tourism, during the covid- 19 pandemic. 180 respondents were gathered, consisting of ota’s indonesian customers who have experienced service failures due to the pandemic and thus have to request a refund, reschedule or cancel their travel plans. for data analysis, the pls-sem method was used. the findings showed that all justice variables had a significant and positive influence on customer satisfaction. only procedural justice exerted a significant influence on customer loyalty, and none of the justice variables had an influence on brand image. customer satisfaction did not have a significant influence on customer loyalty, yet it positively affected brand image. the brand image was also found to influence customer loyalty. therefore, it is essential for ota (s) business practitioners to pay attention to service recovery efforts during the pandemic as it can lead to long-term business success that will be beneficial in post-pandemic situations.","service recovery, justice theory, ota",,"marcella stephanie lawu, imam santoso, raden mas asbudiutomo, and willy gunadi business management program, management department, binus business school master program, bina nusantara university, jakarta, indonesia 11480 marcella.lawu@binus.ac.id, imam.santoso@binus.ac.id, raden.asbudiutomo@binus.ac.id, wgunadi@binus.edu","References

470,Investigating The Innovativeness Of Public Transport  Systems: The Case Of Tshwane Rapid Transit (Trt) ‘A,"globally, towns and cities are changing toward more adventurous technology innovations while improving practical transportation systems. in response to this new dawn, the bus rapid transit concept has emerged as an accepted effective, accessible, and dependable mass transit method for innovative systems. nevertheless, in spite of extensive efforts, benchmarks, and investments in the creation and enhancement of such systems, relatively little research has been recorded on spatial and operational applications of such an innovative transit systems, particularly in emerging economies. the paper therefore investigates the spatial and operational considerations and outcomes of innovative transit systems in the city of tshwane. the research design was observational and experimental, with qualitative techniques applied to collect perceptual responses. the sample responded to questionnaires and forty participants were obtained. despite the reality, which brt contributes to a better transport network, there seem to be strengths and weaknesses which necessitate further investigation. the integration of different modes of public transportation through use of boarding cards is recommended. the public transportation single ticketing system for the city of tshwane, which seeks to integrate various public transport systems needs further investigation.",city of tshwane,"A sustainable public transport system is socially acceptable, satisfies passenger requirements, is affordable to the poor, and is financially sustainable (Adewumi et al. 2013). 7.1 Policy and legislative frameworks on innovative public transport systems, particularly the Tshwane Rapid Transit in South Africa Various policy and legislative frameworks have guided effective governance and delivery of public transport. The White Paper discusses the importance of public transportation in increasing mobility and accessibility; it also certifies public transportation tendering and long-term finance through the tendering system. A Re Yeng is well defined as a high quality, efficient innovative transportation structure providing quick, pleasant urban travel using dedicated lanes and is funded by the National Treasury under the Division of Revenue Act (DoRA). Long-term plans, such as the National Master Plan (NATMAP) 2050 and the Gauteng Master Plan are what transportation- planning systems must address. This planning process should not only address the short term but should also give an impression for long term planning which acknowledges the spatial patterns within South African cities, and also how this pattern can be aligned and changed to accommodate an integrated, accessible transport system. 7.2 Spatial planning and integration considerations and consequences of innovative public transport systems: ‘A Re Yeng’ in the City of Tshwane A Re Yeng system is a component of the approach addressing mechanism which views public transportation as a system.

472,The Role Of Digital Customer Experience And  Relationship Quality In Customer Loyalty In Food,"the usage of digital platforms for food delivery increased enormously during the covid-19 pandemic because of the restrictions on mobility such as enforced working from home or studying from home. however, little is known about customer loyalty in food delivery applications. this study aims to investigate the relationship between digital platform usage and customer loyalty in food delivery applications. we hypothesize that the digital customer experience will mediate the digital platform usage to customer loyalty. the relationship quality will moderate the digital customer experience to customer loyalty. using a survey, this research collected 297 respondents as the sample. this research used linear regression to test this relationship. the results revealed that digital platform usage had a strong positive relationship with customer loyalty, and a positive relationship with digital customer experience. the role of digital customer experience as a mediating variable and relationship quality as a moderating variable had a positive influence on the model although not as strong as the direct relationship between digital platform usage and customer loyalty. digital customer experience influenced customer loyalty through repurchase intention and positive word-of-mouth.","customer experience, customer loyalty",,"delivery applications asnan furinto1, dewi tamara2, eva lie hwa3, evy evianti kriswandi4, hamina ali5 1 doctoral research management, bina nusantara university. jalan hang lekir i no 6, jakarta 10270, indonesia. email: afurinto@binus.edu 2,3,4,5 executive in strategic management, bina nusantara university, jalan hang lekir i no 6, jakarta 10270, indonesia. email: dtamara@binus.edu","References

477,Application Of The Smed Method To Increase The Efficiency  Of The Sealing Process In A Peruvian Company That Produces,"currently, in the peruvian industrial sector, most companies are affected by the low efficiency provided by the staff when carrying out their respective work. this arises because most companies are looking for the cheapest labor they can get and not all these people have the economic capacity to receive a good level of education. in manufacturing companies, it is almost always possible to observe ""the law of minimum effort in the operators"" which causes operations without added value to arise in the processes, unnecessary delays and all this translates into processes with low efficiency. what we want to demonstrate in the following investigation is how, with adequate training for the personnel, all these mentioned defects can be reduced and with a not very high investment for the company. there are many tools that we can use that the lean six sigma methodology gives us depending on the objective to improve. this article mentions the implementation of the smed tool in a flexible plastic production company where we were able to achieve an 8% increase in the efficiency of the sealing area with the reduction of product change over time.","flexible plastic, smed, set-up, sealing process","The analysis carried out on a Peruvian company that produces flexible plastic fulfilled the general objective that we had set at the beginning of this study, which had as its main task to reduce the unproductive times that were generated during the sealing process. This could be achieved thanks to the SMED methodology, which helped us to identify and classify the different types of activities and consequently to be able to reduce the time they took to carry out. To carry out the above, the list of actions to be taken must be detailed to be able to follow up on them and modify the new scenario if necessary, so that the optimization is adequate. In addition, it is important to assess the magnitude of the improvement to know if it is appropriate to apply the improvement.","flexible plastic jose alejandro vargas-acha, tomas aramburu-linares and juan carlos quiroz-flores facultad de ingeniería y arquitectura, universidad de lima, lima perú 20143286@aloe.ulima.edu.pe, 20151610@aloe.ulima.edu.pe, jcquiroz@ulima.edu.pe",

486,The Influence Of Talent Acquisition And Talent Pool On The  Leadership Readiness Mediated By Perceived Organization,"human resource management plays a great role within a company. the main role is to prepare capable and relevant people to run and operate the company's business activities. gaps that often exist in human resources management and expected leaders in the future trigger a serious problem in the company and may cause momentum loss, so there should be more preparations needed for the regeneration of leaders in the future. this research is conducted to identify the infuence of talent acquisition and talent pool on leadership readiness, as well as to examine perceived organization support as a mediation of the relationship between talent acquisition and talent pool on leadership readiness. this study takes the data from 57 branch offices of state-owned insurance companies using stratified sampling. the results showed that talent acquisition had a significant effect on leadership readiness, with a coefficient value of 0.539 and a statistical t-value of 9.926 (>t critical 1.96). the influence of talent pool on leadership readiness produces a coefficient value of 0.566 and a statistical t value of 10,567 which means it has a significant effect. furthermore, the influence of organizational support on leadership readiness produces a coefficient value of 0.482 and a statistical t value of 8.545 which means it has a significant effect. meanwhile, perceived organizational support significantly mediates the relationship between talent and talent pool on leadership readiness, with z values on the sobel test of 6.77 and 7.931 (>z table 1.960). these factors can help the company to conduct a mapping to prepare cadres to fill positions as leaders in the future.","talent acquisition, talent pool","Talent acquisition can have a significant positive influence on leadership readiness through the recruitment and selection process for the employees by identifying the best talents to raise quality leadership. Furthermore, the talent pool can have a significant positive influence on leadership readiness, by using the talent development center program. It is expected that employees with high qualifications and skills can be selected and included in the program to sustain stronger leadership in state-owned insurance companies. Perceived organization support has a significant and positive relationship to leadership readiness. It means that the full support of state-owned insurance companies has a significant contribution in providing opportunities for all potential employees.

By having excellent quality and maintaining that quality, consumers will have a topic of discussion and will carry out conversations with people around, even do promotions and resale. In implementing this strategy, word-of-mouth has three levels of success indicators, namely talking, promoting, and selling. Dorikan has successfully entered the third level through sales made by consumers personally without any promotion or sales requests requested by the owner. The word-of-mouth strategy has been proven to affect the percentage increase in sales of the Dorikan food business. The word-of-mouth strategy affected an increase of 28%. It can be concluded that by implementing the word-of-mouth strategy, the strategy has succeeded in increasing the sales scale of the Dorikan food business. The author recommends word-of-mouth activities by paying attention to the five essential elements in word-of- mouth. These five essential elements are a solid foundation for business owners so that consumers can feel satisfied with the products that have been offered. By having these five elements, the word-of-mouth strategy will slowly enter the success level of the word-of-mouth strategy. If consumers are satisfied, they will voluntarily offer to those around them through simple talks, promotions, or resale without spending much money on marketing.","meiliana lukman and iston dwija utama entrepreneurship department, binus business school. undergraduate program bina nusantara university bandung, indonesia 40181 meiliana.lukman@binus.ac.id; iston.utama@binus.edu","references.

The government and local communities provide positive and creative responses to support the sustainability of the geopark tourism development through constructive participation in various aspects of the economy, culture, and environmental management, which at the same time empowers the socio-economic potential of local communities. In line with this, local governments facilitate the participation of local communities through the provision of infrastructure to develop the socio-economic potential of the community, including the development of transportation access, development of cultural-based tourism villages and rural economies, creative economy training and tour guides, all of which support sustainability. geopark tourism and also socio-economic empowerment of local communities. However, the involvement of these stakeholders has not worked optimally. This is due to several factors, especially the limited capacity of regional budgets. Meanwhile, the central government handed over the management of geopark tourism to regional independence. Overcoming these limitations, local governments need to optimally involve the private sector as part of the stakeholders, which should support the sustainability of regional development. On the other hand, community participation also needs to be optimized, especially in terms of increasing tourism taxes which have the potential to contribute to local revenue (PAD). The growth of business sectors such as lodging, homestays, restaurants/restaurants, has not been optimally regulated in terms of retribution taxes and development that provides economic benefits.

However, based on the different test, the ROA value obtained is lower than the EVA. Measuring financial performance using Economic Value Added shows an increasing value every year. Based on the different test results, the Economic Value Added value is higher than ROA value. Based on the two measurement methods, namely the ROA and EVA based on the test results, there are significant differences. From the two methods, Economic Value Added is said to be better than the ROA in measuring financial performance because the Economic Value Added method takes into account the risks and costs of capital used by the company.","sector companies in indonesia stock exchange 2016-2020 period budi rustandi kartawinata1, aldi akbar2, mahir pradana3 1,2,3faculty of communication and business telkom university indonesia 1budikartawinata@telkomuniversity.ac.id",

501,Selection Of Temperature Screening Methods   For Covid-19 By Fuzzy Topsis Technique,"in the covid-19 pandemic, temperature screening before a person enters a workplace can help to evaluate the patient and limit further spread of the virus. there are two types of temperature screening methods typically used in thailand: (1) standing infrared thermometer and (2) infrared thermometer gun. this research aimed to use the fuzzy topsis technique to select the suitable temperature screening methods for 8 screening stations at the case study. five criteria for the selection of the suitable methods were identified by experts, including cost, accuracy, process waiting time, convenience to use the tool, and customer satisfaction. these criteria were then ranked by staff working at each temperature screening station. data related to these criteria were collected and input in the fuzzy topsis technique process. the results showed that the stations that considered the accuracy, process waiting time, and convenience to use the tool as important criteria were suggested to use the standing infrared thermometer. while the remaining stations were suggested to use the infrared thermometer gun. this research can contribute to academic literature as it presents the application of fuzzy topsis in the activities related to covid-19 that is currently limited in existing studies.","covid-19, in wuhan, hubei province","and Suggestions for Future Research This research used the Fuzzy TOPSIS technique to select the suitable temperature screening methods for 8 screening stations at the case study. The research was formulated based on two research questions: what are the criteria that should be considered for selecting the temperature screening method for each station? and what is a suitable temperature screening method for those stations? Five criteria identified by experts for selecting the suitable temperature screening methods consisted of cost, accuracy, process waiting time, convenience to use of the tool, and customer satisfaction. And the results from Fuzzy TOPSIS show that the stations (A, B, F, G, and H) that considered the accuracy, process waiting time, and convenience to use the tool as crucial criteria were suggested to use the standing infrared thermometer, while the remaining stations (C, D, and E) should use the infrared thermometer gun. This research contributes to academic literature as it demonstrates the application of Fuzzy TOPSIS in the activities related to COVID-19. This aspect is still limited in existing studies because most studies use the Fuzzy TOPSIS in manufacturing or marketing activities. Furthermore, the COVID-19 has just been identified in late 2019. In terms of the suggestions, future research may include perspectives from other parties in the selection of criteria for selecting the temperature screening methods, such as doctors or customers – this research included only the experts who have experience in the process of temperature screening. Including perspectives from other parties may extend this research and result in other criteria that should consider for selecting the temperature screening system. Future research may also apply other techniques, such as AHP or Fuzzy AHP, in the selection of the screening system considering a wide range of criteria. Future research may focus on the uncertainty of criteria and apply the mathematical models to find the optimized solution under the stochastic constraints (Askari et al., 2020; Gharaei et al., 2020; Giri and Masanta, 2020). Additionally, research should further focus on the transfer of modern technologies, e.g., artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning (Woschank et al. 2020), and novel simulation approaches, e.g., digital twins (Kaiblinger and Woschank 2022), to the respective domain. The results from those further studies may reveal different perspectives that can add to the value of this research.","tinnakorn phongthiya and chawis boonmee* department of industrial engineering faculty of engineering, chiang mai university chiang mai, thailand tinnakorn.phongthiya@cmu.ac.th, chawis.boonmee@cmu.ac.th manuel woschank chair of industrial logistics, montanuniversitaet leoben leoben, austria manuel.woschank@unileoben.ac.at",
502,Cryptocurrency Exchange Application Acceptance With  Tam Model In Indonesia,"a cryptocurrency exchange application is a platform that provides a facility for users to do a crypto asset transaction. in indonesia, there are two types of applications, regulated and unregulated apps with various and different facilities. this research aims to analyze factors that influence users' acceptance to use cryptocurrency exchange applications with extended tam methods with 7 external variables such as design, experience, perceived risk, regulatory support, social influence, trust, and perceived benefit. then, we analyzed the data collected using the structural equation modeling (sem) - partial least square (pls) method. this research's result was conducted to analyze and give recommendations for the next research and the apps provider regarding factors that influenced users’ acceptance to use the cryptocurrency exchange application. the number of samples will be determined using a formula from roscoe theory with a minimum of 110 respondents and the questionnaire was filled out by 130 respondents using google forms. this research's result has proven that trust and design are external variables that affect cryptocurrency exchange application acceptance. in contrast with the previous study in which regulatory support affects the user's trust, this research found social influence and experience are variables that affect user's trust (albayati et al., 2020). proceedings of the international conference on industrial engineering and operations management istanbul, turkey, march 7-10, 2022 ieom society international 4625",,", this research contributes to the development of the TAM model with extended it with 7 external variables. Even though, there are several variables that couldn't be a strong and significant factor to determine users’ intention to use and adopt cryptocurrency exchange applications. 6.2 Recommendation for next research ● The respondent of this research is mostly in the range age of 17-22. The authors recommend broadening the respondent’s age type in the above range of 17-22 to determine the factors in each age group. So that we could get a varied perspective and prevent the bias results. ● Also, the author recommends having further research of other latent variables that the author has not observed, and it might be the strongest factor that influences the user to use and adopt cryptocurrency exchange applications. 6.3 Recommendation for cryptocurrency exchange application provider From our research, trust and design are the main external factors that could influence users to use and adopt cryptocurrency exchange applications. To gain competitiveness, the first one is to increase the design quality of the application so that could ease the user to use the application. Second, increase the trust level of customers by developing a good reputation and knowledgeable application. Third, enhanced the features in the application. So that, it could impact beneficially to the user.","annisa dwi ananda information systems department, school of information systems, bina nusantara university, jakarta, indonesia 11480 annisa.ananda001@binus.ac.id azka reivan mumtaza information systems department, school of information systems, bina nusantara university, jakarta, indonesia 11480 azka.mumtaza@binus.ac.id salsabila denia harsyarie information systems department, school of information systems, bina nusantara university, jakarta, indonesia 11480 salsabila.harsyarie@binus.ac.id fredy jingga information systems department, school of information systems, bina nusantara university, jakarta, indonesia 11480 fjingga@binus.edu",
503,Factors Analysis And Prediction In Die-Casting Process For  Defects Reduction,"defect reduction has always been the continuous improvement topic that is being addressed in the manufacturing industry. even nowadays, that the world is moving into the industrial 4.0, such a particular topic still has never outdated, only the new approaches have been introduced for the better achievement of defect reduction. this research aims to reduce the defects in die-casting process of the hard disk drive (hdd) component manufacturing company, focusing on the effects of various machine parameters on the defects occurring in casting products. predictive maintenance approach and machine learning have been introduced to determine the suitable data modelling technique. • the most related independent factors can be identified through feature importance method. • decision tree (dt) performed the best results among other classification methods. • the 91.18% accuracy can be obtained by decision tree algorithm. however, the ratio of labelled data still needs to be reviewed and optimized for the future work as well as continue the actual checking on the frontline production results with the subject-matter expert (sme) also required in order to obtain the best prediction results.","big data analytics, classification, defects prediction, machine learning","Based on Feature importance analysis method it can be concluded the Factor 26 (Pressure releasing related) is the most contributing factor affecting the porosity defect that occurs on the outer surface of die-cast product, followed by Factor 3 (High-speed related), Factor 27 (Pressure releasing related), Factor 8 (High-speed related), and Factor 16 (Filling pressure related). The Decision Trees (DT) algorithm perform the best predictive results when considering a minor classification regarding G-Mean value, the 91.18% accuracy can be obtained by this algorithm. However, after performing investigation and analysis on the results and raw data, there is one concerning point in which the extremely low percentage of NG data were observed. Therefore, in the future work, the imbalance dataset needs to reviewed and optimized. The actual checking on the frontline production with the Subject-Matter Expert (SME) is still required. As well as continue to study the other types of classification and several feature selection methods those would also be taken into the consideration in order to obtain the most suitable and robustness prediction model for the real practice manner. Acknowledgment The author would like to express the gratitude to colleagues, supervisors, and top management of this manufacturing company for the full support of the essential information and technical advice provided. Most importantly, special thanks to the academic advisor who had dedicated his time to advice. This project would have not been completed without these meaningful contributions.

505,"Comparing Credibility, Attractiveness, And Brand Matchup Of Jakarta Museum Ambassadors And Museum","the purpose of this study was to understand by using museum ambassadors which is credibility, attractive and match-up with the museum profile can affect consumer’s visit intention. the data was collected from a sample of 100 respondents using a questionnaire and analyzed using quantitative analysis. the results were that museum ambassador/ social media influencer who is credible has no direct influence on visit intention, but smi attractiveness, product match up, and museum experience all directly influence visit intention. however, in general, the museum’s main problem is not the promotion. the experience of visiting the museum has not reflected the visitor-oriented museum. therefore, the focus of this article is to determine the effectiveness of the use of duta museum (museum ambassadors) in influencing young adults' interest in visiting the museum by measuring the credibility, attractiveness, and suitability of the ambassadors' image of the museum. then it compares the influence of the museum ambassadors with the overall experience given by each museum on people's attitudes and intention to visit the museum.","museum marketing, museum ambassador, experience, attitude","& Discussion The following conclusions are derived from data analysis and hypothesis testing results: (1) SMI Credibility and Attractiveness do not directly have a significant effect on consumer attitudes towards published museums. While Product Match Up, Museum Experience directly has a significant effect on Consumer Attitude towards published museums. (2) SMI Credibility has no direct influence on visit intention, but SMI Attractiveness, Product Match Up, and Museum Experience all directly influence Visit Intention. (3) Consumer Attitude is mediation between Product Match Up and Visit Intention and is also mediation between Museum Experience and Visit Intention. However, Consumer Attitude is not mediation between SMI Credibility and Visit Intention and not mediation between SMI Attractiveness and Visit Intention. From the conclusions, we recommend several things. First, the museum must offer an experience that meets visitors' needs by creating a better marketing strategy, starting from changing the mindset of product-oriented to visitor- oriented. Then, museums must conduct research and process the data of visitors so that they can find out the behavior, needs, and values of these visitors. Then they must take into account these needs and behaviors and make necessary adjustments to the museum's marketing strategy, including educational programs and museum promotion. As a result, the public's attitude towards the image of museums can change and influence the intention to visit. The museum can also ask marketing consultants for help regarding research and processing visitors' data. Second, Duta Museum is only a way of promotional strategy to support a museum/museum brand as a whole. Promotion will not be effective if the public's attitude towards museums is still not good and the message to be conveyed by each museum is not in accordance with the current society's values. Museums must first know what values they want to convey to the public. Then they must be consistent in conveying messages through direct interactions at the museum (through labels, museum staff, etc.) and promotional media. If they want to use Duta Museum as a promotional medium, they must also convey the message. Then they must use an ambassador who has good credibility. Finally, museums must conduct a campaign on several social media accounts owned by the museums and on the Duta Museum's social media account and hold a series of programs each month to maintain the museum's image in the public’s minds. This research has several limitations that also need to do further research. First this research is only using quantitative method and it needs qualitative research for more concrete solution for the museum industry. The future research should examine the relationship between museum audience motivation, museum audience experience, social media promotion and visit intention. That research will make a huge difference in Indonesian museum sector.","experience towards visit intention jelita permata full magister student of creative marketing management department bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia jelita.permata@binus.ac.id farras caesarmas putri full magister student of creative marketing management department bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia farras.putri@binus.ac.id marsha herryanna full magister student of creative marketing management department bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia marsha.herryanna@binus.ac.id jerry s. justianto full lecturer of integrated digital marketing management department bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia jerry.justianto@binus.ac.id",
506,Effectiveness Of Implementing E-Government Procurement  In Sri Lanka,"e-procurement is one of the most important sophisticated technologies employed by both the public and private sectors throughout the world. many top-tier firms use this electronic platform in the procurement process to accomplish operations more efficiently and effectively by reducing corruption and other unusual expenses. at this moment sri lanka is facing for a severe financial crisis. the major causes of these problems include a reduction in sri lanka's dollar reserves, currency depreciation, and the impact of the covid-19 epidemic. currently, the government spends a lot of money on the procurement process in the public sector. to recover from this situation, government may adopt an e-government procurement system into the public procurement process, which will help to save the billion rupees to the country by decreasing corruption and unnecessary expenses. based on the past articles, we have identified there are several studies which have been conducted on e-government procurement systems around the world. procurement plays a vital role in a country as it is one of the major tools to build up a strong economy and gives value for money. with the development of technology, procurement has been adopted to an electronic platform that enables more effective and efficient processes for the government. by observing previous studies, researchers have determined some significant factors influencing the implementation of electronic government procurement. this paper has been conducted a systematic literature review based on findings of previous articles related to this study area.","e-procurement, public sector, technology",,"gihini weerasinghe, banusha kanaheraarachchi, madushan jayaweera and ishini aryaratne, udanee samarasinghe, navodika karunaratna business school sri lanka institute of information technology (sliit) gihiniweerasinghe@yahoo.com, banushajananga17@gmail.com, shanjay906699@gmail.com, ayodhya.ishi@gmail.com,udanee.s@sliit.lk,navodika.k@sliit.lk","References

507,Energy Efficient Ceramic Sanitaryware Production  Planning With A Hybrid Simulation Optimization Method,"the ceramic sanitaryware production process consists of casting, drying, glazing, and firing operations. the operation that uses the most energy is the firing process. this study handles a case sanitaryware production factory and proposes a production planning method for energy-efficient manufacturing. in the case factory, the firing process takes place on wagons that carry the products through a tunnel-gas oven. increasing the wagon surface area utilization decreases the energy consumption per unit product. the wagons continuously move with a predetermined speed and pick up their loads from the end of the glazing lines. the glazing lines have limited-sized end buffers, and products are manually carried in case of a buffer overflow. a wagon can load a product only if the product is ready in the glazing line end buffer while the wagon is passing in front of that line in real-time. efficient wagon loading requires having the right products at the end buffers at the right time. this study develops a hybrid simulation optimization model to determine the production plan that minimizes the number of wagons used and the buffer overflows. the proposed method consists of two parts. the first part uses a linear programming model to assign the product demands to appropriate glazing lines such that the glazing lines' workload is balanced in terms of total production time and total product surface in lines. then the model orders the products in each line according to their types and assigns them to drying process vehicles. the second part of the model uses a hybrid simulation - genetic algorithm heuristic to obtain the best product/wagon assignments with the given glazing production plan. the production plan is further improved with a heuristic drying vehicle replacement rule. the model gradually improves the production plan within a closed- loop cycle between the wagon-product assignment heuristic and the drying vehicle replacement heuristic. results show that the model can effectively reduce the number of wagons used and buffer overflow for a given demand.","hybrid simulation, ankara",,"emre doğru, nilgun fescioglu-unver department of industrial engineering tobb university of economics and technology ankara, turkey emredogru@etu.edu.tr, nfunver@etu.edu.tr",

516,Considerations Prior Adoption Of Design Thinking For  Project Management,"design thinking as one of the approaches to collaborative identification and solving a problem has been highly recognized by practitioners and academics in providing potential value in enhancing innovative results for products, services, or strategies and is vastly recommended to be applied in project management. however, none of the empirical studies explores factors that influence design thinking adoption in the projects. this study covers this gap and explores several predictors that influence the adoption of design thinking in projects. with diffusion of innovation as the theoretical basis, data were collected from 106 project managers in indonesia who are experienced in implementing design thinking in their projects. the findings suggest that innovation's perceived relative advantage, observability, and complexity significantly influence the adoption of design thinking. contrary to finding in existing literature, perceived compatibility and trialability of design thinking have no influence on the adoption in the project. the education and tenure of the project manager are also found to do not moderate perceived complexity association towards the adoption of design thinking. this study contributes to organizations determining and developing strategies to maximize the use of design thinking in projects, thus increasing the chances of success in innovation projects.","design thinking, project management",,"gigih suhartanto, and tengku mohd. khairal abdullah* business management program, management department, binus business school master program, bina nusantara university, jakarta, indonesia, 11480 gigih.suhartanto@binus.ac.id, tabdullah@binus.edu*",
517,Analysis On Ecommerce Platforms Using Marketing  Dashboards And Forecasting Techniques,"in the past year, the business has been striving to create strategies based on opinionated matters handed by the digital trend. through forecasting analysis and data visualisation tools, the researcher was able to create a report that shows their position with the variables that were consolidated from ecommerce platforms. the combined information was able to create a forecast as to where the business might be considering that they create an initiative into reaching out to their targets online. as the business wanted to maximise the tools that they have, this brought an idea to create dashboards and reports that are currently being used by the management to see whether the sales and marketing initiatives are incurring reasonable revenue to the business.","ecommerce, forecasting, sales revenue, conversion rate","In conclusion, the researcher was able to create a dashboard that combined the common variables from the different ecommerce platforms. In line with the goal, the business was able to evaluate and assess their position in the digital channels. Insights were further explained as the management focused on the topics regarding the brand, seasons and platforms. As the report was handed out to the company, the business concluded that brand is an essential factor for the consumer which is why it captured more than 70% of the total e-commerce revenue. In line with this, it also showed the importance of using known platforms in the country to make it visible to their consumers online. In line with the prediction analysis run by the researcher to the business, the sales revenue of the business during the third quarter of 2021 showed a decline by at least 8% because of internal issues being faced by the management. Through the forecast, the business was able to create a strategy and took advantage of the holidays season that made their sales rise by more than 50% of their revenue compared to the previous quarters. 5.","hannah grace c. holgado master in business analytics mapua university, philippines hgcholgado@mymail.mapua.edu.ph ericson d. dimaunahan assistant professor mapua university, philippines eddimaunahan@mapua.edu.ph",
518,Project Management Vs Product Management:   A View On The Journey From Project To Product,"software product management (spm) has higher interest both in our country and globally. many companies operating in the it or software sector are renewing their project-based approach to product-based visions, with the influence of success stories of “big tech” companies especially. the situation is not only affected by the strategy change but most it companies also change their working styles such as remote working, digitalization and development methodologies such as agile or lean approaches. moreover, the definition of the product management itself is still trying to be structured with many on-going specifications around the project management (pm) versus product management discussions. product management neither have a special branch in universities nor a specific certification in official industrial organizations. and in the field, in most companies, product management does not have a well-defined framework and is often treated as an ad hoc discipline. the aim of this study is to provide a comprehensive view on spm and pm professions. first the roles, definitions, responsibilities, and differences are elaborated based on academic search. then, with an active software project and product management field experience, the major functionalities are mapped to areas of expertise and the overlap between spm and pm are shown in this functional map. thus, it is expected to understand the actual needs of productization in software companies and specify the challenges in combination with academic approach and field experience.","product management, project management, spm","Over the last few years, there is a shift from project-based development to product-based development in whole over the world. The essential effect of BigTech companies and their world wide products are giving some good reasons for businesses to re-think about structuring their mindset and work in terms of products rather than projects. A product manager, is viewed as the “CEO” of the specified product(s) and its responsibility begins with the early lifecycle of the ideation through the retirement of the product. So they are basicly in charge of evolving the idea from the early stages, setting the vision of the product, develop and launch it and make sure that it brings some value to the customers. In order to do that, SPM should listen carefully the potential customers, direct and update the product to fulfill the customer needs until the product retirement. Their position is more of becoming the voice of the customers throughout the product lifecycle. Unlike project managers, SPM do not have a clear view on the beginning and the end, as it evolves constantly. Project managers, apply set of different methodologies which allow them to organize the project work in an efficient, timely and qualified manner. They have to solve different challenges throughout the project lifecycle but they have more explicitly defined targets along with some tools, teams, timeframes, budgets and some other elements. Their project metrics and KPIs are also well defined most of the time and measured with exact results to decide whether project success or failures. PMs, experienced PMs especially, have meticulous scheduling and tight control actions to avoid potential pitfalls through the project cycles. Software product managers world is evolving rapidly with the requirements of digital revolution. Its set of working methodologies is constantly changing (Agile, Scrum, Jobs To Be Done) in relation to product development or features. Also the other domains that they need to function is evolving accordingly as well, such as digital marketing. SPMs don’t have a well defined framework and even an educational background yet and they have to adapt multiple challenges in multiple domains. Product Success or product failure definitions are completely relative depending on the product goal or the company goals. Thus, targets, tools, timelines, teams or requirements can change on the way and it may not be possible to keep the ‘set targets’, especially when it is thought that the product managers responsibility is from the early beginning to the literal end of a product.

520,Capability-Based Facility Layout Design With Unequal-Area  Departments,"capability based facility layout approach was proposed by baykasoğlu two decades ago in order to better utilize the hidden flexibility of manufacturing resources. however, in the previous capability-based layout design approaches only equally sized departments are considered and they are assigned to the pre-specified facility locations. to the best of our knowledge, there is no previous work on the capability-based facility layout design with unequal area departments. based on this motivation, a new unequal-area capability-based facility layout design (ua-cbfld) problem is introduced in this research first time in the literature. indeed, machines’ processing capabilities that are described in terms of resource elements (res) are taken into consideration while designing the facility layout. because, designing facility layouts by using the machining capabilities or res is more advantageous as it enables facility designers to expose hidden flexibility that is available in manufacturing systems. we firstly developed a mixed- integer non-linear programming model for the proposed ua-cbfld problem. because of the np-completeness and highly nonlinear structure of the stated problem, a polyhedral inner-approximation method is employed for the nonlinear department area constraints. therefore, we also provided a mixed-integer linear programming (milp) model formulation of the stated problem. however, department areas in the resulting solutions may be too little higher or equal to the required areas since this linear approximation method guarantees a given maximum deviation error for the required areas. in order to demonstrate validity and applicability of the proposed milp model of the ua-cbfld problem, an illustrative numerical example was first presented in order to analyze the effects of different machine- capability overlapping cases (i.e., no, low, medium and high overlaps) on the optimization results. afterwards, its performance is also tested on a real-life manufacturing case study. the computational experiments have shown that applicable and efficient layout design alternatives can be generated by making use of the proposed model. proceedings of the international conference on industrial engineering and operations management istanbul, turkey, march 7-10, 2022 ieom society international 4789",,,"bilge varol research assistant in industrial engineering faculty of engineering and natural sciences bahcesehir university istanbul, turkey bilge.varol@eng.bau.edu.tr kemal subulan associate professor of industrial engineering faculty of engineering dokuz eylul university izmir, turkey kemal.subulan@eng.deu.edu.tr adil baykasoğlu full professor of industrial engineering faculty of engineering dokuz eylul university izmir, turkey adil.baykasoglu@eng.deu.edu.tr",
521,Sizing Of Raw Materials In A Corrugated Cardboard Box  Manufacturing Company Via Simulated Annealing,"in order to survive and to be competitive in today's highly turbulent business environments manufacturing companies should manage their operations efficiently and effectively. optimizing costs, including purchasing and raw material waste costs is an important step in reaching these targets. wasting raw materials due to non-optimal utilization is one of the reasons for considerable financial losses in many industries including corrugated box manufacturers. based on this motivation, it is aimed to optimize purchasing and raw material waste costs of a corrugated box manufacturing company in this work. the company, where the case study is performed manufactures boxes of different sizes by cutting them from two-dimensional cardboard raw materials of certain sizes. the manufacturing company sizes its raw materials heuristically that is based on the experience gained over the years. however, the company is aware of non-optimal product-raw material matchings and aims to reduce resulting costs. in this study, an integer nonlinear programming (inp) model is developed in order to determine optimal sizes of raw materials to be purchased and their matching with the products to be manufactured. in order to be able to solve the developed model effectively the stated inp problem is decomposed into two interrelated problems (parts). in the first part, a simulated annealing (sa) algorithm is devised for sizing of the raw materials, as soon as the sa algorithm determines alternative raw material sizes it calls the second part, where an integer linear programming (ilp) model is solved to assign products to raw materials and compute costs under several constraints. the proposed optimization system is coded in python where gurobi solver is called for solving ilp. application of the proposed optimization system to company’s data has revealed considerable cost reductions.","waste reduction, metaheuristics",,"incorporating integer linear programming ilkim sipahi industrial engineer the graduate school of natural and applied sciences dokuz eylul university izmir, turkey ilkim.sipahi@ogr.deu.edu.tr adil baykasoğlu full professor of industrial engineering faculty of engineering dokuz eylul university izmir, turkey adil.baykasoglu@deu.edu.tr kemal subulan associate professor of industrial engineering faculty of engineering dokuz eylul university izmir, turkey kemal.subulan@deu.edu.tr",
522,Analysis Of Supply Chain Complexity Drivers In Make-To-Stock And  Make-To-Order Supply Chain Using Ahp-Dematel Approach,"to become competitive, companies use different strategies to produce their product. make-to-stock (mts) and make-to-order (mto) are the most popular production strategies. each of these strategies has its own advantages and drawbacks. irrespective of the strategy company uses, today in the global market, it is essential for the companies to understand the complexities associated with their supply chain (sc) and aim to ease or manage them. supply chain complexity (scc) can be defined as any property of a sc that increases its complexity and leads to difficulties in producing the product and delivering the service. the complexity in sc can be caused by factors, which are either internal or external to the sc or the factor may lie at the demand and supply interface. all the factors that create complexity to the sc are known as the scc drivers. many researches have been carried out in the past to identify and analyze the scc drivers. however, these researches did not explicitly distinguish and analyze the identified drivers based on the production strategy the company uses. as mts and mto are two completely different strategies with different production planning, procurement and inventory characteristics, the associated scc drivers and impact of one driver over others for these two strategies may be different. therefore, in order to fulfill the gap that exists in the existing literature, this study focuses on identifying, analyzing and comparing the scc drivers in mts and mto production systems. to fulfil the aforementioned research gap, in this study at first generic drivers of scc were identified from the extensive literature review. altogether, twenty-two drivers of scc were identified from the literature review. to filter the unimportant drivers, as compared to other, from the identified twenty-two drivers, pareto analysis is conducted. for this purpose, a questionnaire survey was carried out to understand the level of impact these drivers has on the sc. questionnaire was send to a sample of two hundred random manufacturers in oil and gas (o&g) sc. the reason for the selection of o&g sc is due to the fact that some of the o&g sc partner operates based on mts strategy while others operate under mto production strategy. out of the two hundred random samples, fifty valid responses were recorded. the questionnaire was prepared such that from the response it will be able to identify the strategy the company uses to operate their system. based on the 80/20 rule of pareto analysis, six drivers were eliminated from the identified twenty-two drivers. however, the eliminated drivers form mts and mto systems are different. the eliminated drivers for mts systems are: number of supporting parts to produce a product, collaboration between the supplier and manufacturer, forecasting error, diversity of demand/ demand uncertainty, and delivery lead time. on the other hand, for the mto system, the drivers are: diversity of demand/demand uncertainty, new technology required to produce the product, government regulation, incompatible information technology between partners, competitor action and forecasting error. these eliminated drivers were further discussed with the experts from the industry to confirm the results obtained from pareto analysis. proceedings of the international conference on industrial engineering and operations management istanbul, turkey, march 7-10, 2022 ieom society international 4793",,,"yahya al hinai, *sujan piya, nasr al-hinai department of mechanical and industrial engineering college of engineering, sultan qaboos university muscat, oman s125022@student.squ.edu.om, sujan@squ.edu.om, nhinai@squ.edu.om extended",
523,Effects Of The Introduction Of The Hyperloop On Existing  Supply Chains,"the hyperloop is an upcoming transportation technology promising to revolutionize the way people and cargo are transported, given the shear speed advantage that a hyperloop pod can travel in as compared to that of any other current land-based transportation mode. using secondary sources to theoretically examine the effects of the hyperloop on existing supply chains, further point estimates are obtained surrounding different variables of the hyperloop such as its speed, carry capacity, and launch rate. a preliminary investigation is then conducted in the context of northern germany, where 19,360,000 tons of cargo were transported in 2013 using trucks. as such, a mirrored hyperloop-based supply chain is modelled, simulated, and compared to that of the control, using arena. it is estimated that the hyperloop could have transported 8% more cargo within the same time period, where it is seen that 26% more hyperloop pods are dispatched when compared to trucks, as per the simulation output.","arena simulation, turkey","To begin with, it is unrealistic to study a supply chain built only upon the hyperloop, as the hyperloop in itself could not transport goods to all end destinations. For instance, whilst the hyperloop can indirectly improve last mile deliveries due to its shear speed, it must be combined with other transportation modes such that last mile deliveries can be completed, where such modes could include existing solutions – a popular option being the use of minivans or developing technologies such as the use of delivery drones. Furthermore, the types and quantities of cargo that can be transported in a hyperloop is currently significantly limited, as cargo such as medicines or fruits/vegetables that may require special compartments that would provide an ideal storing environment is simply not currently possible on the hyperloop as no such design exists of a special hyperloop pod that would transport certain cargo types. What this paper/simulation does show is the significant supply chain capability improvement potential that a hyperloop can provide for existing supply chains, if it is used as a new transportation mode. The importance of performing this exercise lies in showing how advancements in technologies, such as hyperloops, can allow supply chain management to leap forward due to the generation of multiple factors that might help enhance the network. These factors include the speed of travel time, environmental factors, lead time and forecasting methods. Additionally, the research undertaken can have an impact on today’s economy: supply chain managements can benefit in globalizing their networks by investing in a hyperloop system. In light of this, the potential creation of new job opportunities and the gain of social exposure globally will be in effect. 7. Future Works A more accurate figure representing the extent to which supply chain capability can be improved is still unknown, where more sophisticated, supply-chain specific software would be needed to better model another case study of which, portrays its existing supply chain in more detail as well. For instance, supply chain modelling (SCM) globe represents one such software which can simulate supply chains better than Arena, as the latter is a software that specializes in simulating queues. Furthermore, contacting companies that specialize in providing logistics solutions would represent a source of obtaining a more detailed case study to aid with modelling and simulation. Finally, the economic factor of the hyperloop must also be taken into account to gauge the overall attractiveness of the upcoming transportation technology.

All these projects had as a common denominator the presence of the SDE methodology as a driving force of the various processing phases, although presenting different themes, therefore, they were united by some conceptual aspects and therefore all of great use for this study. The very fact of being in various stages of development made it possible to evaluate the interface between the stages of processing in progress and the growing structure of the laboratory itself that was taking shape over time. Thanks to the heterogeneity of the works, it was therefore possible to have real-time feedback on the effectiveness of the solutions adopted both during the progress of the same project, and in comparison, with other work at different stages of progress.

531,Employee Scheduling Problem For A Retail Store With  Multiple Product Categories And Heterogeneous Employees,"the employee scheduling problem is crucial for increasing profits in the retail business as labor costs are among the largest costs to companies. we propose a general analytic approach to solve a real-life motivated employee scheduling problem and apply our approach for a large retail store in turkey. there are multiple product categories in the retail store and sales of each product category are affected whether there is an employee(s) responsible for the product category at that period. our approach provides a suggestion engine for a multi-period employee scheduling problem where the objective is to maximize the profit while generating a shift schedule for part-time and full-time employees. we start solving this problem by analyzing the past 12 months of sales data for a total of nine categories, taken from a large retail store company in turkey. then, we generate a contribution matrix for each category and each period via arena capturing the stochasticity of both demand values and sales probabilities, conditional on the number and types of the employees working at that category and period. following these, a deterministic integer linear programming model (ilp) is proposed to decide how many part-time and full-time employees should work at each category and each period to maximize the total profit. the ilp uses the contribution matrix generated by arena, and also checks for legal working requirements, and it is solved by ibm ilog cplex optimization studio version 20.1.0.","full time employee, part time employee, retailing, shift scheduling","and Future Work This paper focuses on solving an employee scheduling problem to maximize profit. The first step lies in understanding the effect of one additional employee in each time interval and each individual category on overall revenue and representing this complex integrity as a matrix obtained by Arena simulations. This 3-dimensional matrix output is later used as a parameter in our deterministic ILP to maximize the total profit while satisfying working restrictions. The unique contribution of this paper is its unique use of programmable macros on simulation runs used to estimate the effect employment level has on revenue. This information is combined with part-time and full-time employees which can work in different product categories, are issued different costs and all have legal working requirements to abide by. An ILP is solved with the help of a commercial solver to present the optimal shift schedule of the existing situation. Different working constraints such as working in consecutive periods and paid vacations can be added to better represent real-life scenarios. The model can be extended by adding other types of employees, product categories or different objectives as well. Additionally, employee preferences can be added to the model to achieve a better objective value.

532,Drilling Rig Planning And Scheduling,"drilling rigs are massive structures used to drill oil, gas, or water wells. drilling rigs are very costly to own/rent and operate; therefore, they must be used efficiently. scheduling is one of the most critical tasks in reducing oil field costs for oil-producing countries. it is essential in optimizing the schedules of expensive and scarce resources. this will minimize production losses and completion time to drill wells and maximize oil production. this study addresses the planning and scheduling of drilling rigs and workover rigs used to drill new wells and maintain existing wells, respectively. we developed a mixed-integer programming formulation of the rig scheduling problem and implemented it in ibm cplex opl. we validated the model with several computational tests with various test problems. also, we developed a heuristic-based decision support system (dss) for the problem under consideration, which is implemented in excel visual basic. proceedings of the international conference on industrial engineering and operations management istanbul, turkey, march 7-10, 2022 ieom society international 4883",,,"ahmed mohamed al-mazroey husam hamdan al-nasseri mazin matar al-rubkhi b.eng sultan qaboos university, 2021",
533,Machine Learning Based Model For Predicting Student  Outcomes,"machine learning provides various algorithms for application in different domains. in the educational field, huge volume of students’ data is generated and machine learning algorithms serve as valuable tool for pattern identification in students’ behavior. in this paper, crisp dm standard for data mining is applied in the research with decision tree algorithm used for modelling on croatian dataset to develop predictive models for students’ outcomes prediction. data set consisted of 264 students of largest croatian university collected by online survey. the results prove that decision tree modelling achieves superior results in terms of high accuracy and reliability together with interpretability of tree structure and obtained rules in prediction of students’ academic performance. this approach shows promise to be used in student success prediction in the universities in an automatic manner. such model can be used to: (i) improve students' learning and develop personalized recommender systems for optimal learning paths, (ii) emphasize to professors most important determinants of students’ academic success (iii) help management of higher education institutions to facilitate the provision of detailed student learning and adjust institutions strategies, (iv) automate adaptation of the course modules and faculty programs.","machine learning, decision tree, crisp dm","In this paper we have used decision tree algorithm for prediction of the students’ grade point average. The results show the students’ performance and its prediction seems to be accurate. This analysis has shown that the proper machine learning application on student’s performance data can be efficiently used for vital extraction of valuable hidden knowledge from the vast amount of data generated on daily basis. Hereinafter, we provide various guidelines and directions for future research. To exploit the full potential of the student academic performance prediction,further data integration is needed. Besides students demographic data, their learning behaviours, habits and familiy background, nowadays student interaction with the learning environment is a prerequisite to ensure sufficient amount of data for analysis. Having in mind the recent increase in the availability of learning management system data and popularity of such learning environments, data from various sources should be integrated. Future studies should evaluate other machine learning algorithms, such as: artificial neural networks, k-nearest neighbors, Bayesian approaches, support vector machines and ensemble methods to assess whether performance is improved.

534,Reliability Analysis Of Sensorized Stamping Presses By  Generalized Fault Trees,"reliability analysis and probability methods are of extreme importance for understanding the behavior of critical systems. in this scope, dynamic fault trees (dfts) are consolidated graphical models, previously applied at known entities, such as nasa and tesla. however, the (classical) dfts analysis has a known issue; the fact that it assumes that the distribution of basic events (bes) follows the exponential/weibull distribution, which is often a rough approximation of real data distributions. moreover, building a dft model for a real system requires specialized knowledge, to infer the root causes of failures. in this work, a new formalism for the analysis of so-called generic fault trees (gfts) is proposed which extends dft to data-driven scenarios, based on the notion of h-approximation of the associated distributions, where leaves may contain an arbitrary compact support distribution or an h-truncation of a distribution. the approach is validated against known solutions in the literature, showing great accuracy. an optimization process is employed to generate the best structure for training a gft that fits a given data and tested in real use case scenario of a stamping press of bosch thermotechnology. the obtained gft demonstrates a good fit, considering 3 different metrics.",data-driven,,"eugénio m. rocha department of mathematics and center of research and development in mathematics and applications (cidma), campus de santiago, aveiro, 3810-193, portugal eugenio@ua.pt pedro nunes and josé santos department of mechanical engineering and center for mechanical technology and automation (tema), campus de santiago, aveiro, 3810-193, portugal pnunes@ua.pt, jps@ua.pt","References

535,Project Management Methodologies Success Factors  Evaluation Employing Intuitionistic Fuzzy Cognitive Map,"project management methodologies describe the way of working and communicating, and represent the principles and processes in order to manage a project. this paper focuses on three project management methodologies, which are named waterfall, agile, and lean six sigma to provide a multi-dimensional view of success factors. it presents an intuitionistic fuzzy cognitive map (ifcm) application to evaluate the importance degrees of performance indicators of these project management methodologies. the cause-and-effect relationships among concepts; uncertainty, vagueness, and hesitation in data lead to utilize an intuitionistic decision aid approach to assess the performance criteria of project management frameworks.","project management, uncertainty, however","This paper aims to weight success factors of project management methodologies that are most widely used nowadays, named as Waterfall, Agile and Lean Six Sigma. fifteen success indicators of project management methodologies are determined through expert opinions and literature survey. Then, causal relations between pair of factors for each project management methodology are assigned by three decision makers. The most important criteria for waterfall, agile and six sigma project management tools are determined by the result of IFCM, likewise the least important criteria are indicated as they can be eliminated from the evaluation. These assessment criteria will be useful and helpful for top managers to make managerial decisions during the processes of many projects in the increasing technology and competitive environment. Future research directions will focus on selecting the most appropriate provider for outsourcing a project that is supposed to be managed with waterfall, agile or lean six sigma project management methodologies.

537,Analysis Of Governance Principles In The Legislative  Frameworks For Low-Income Housing Development In South,"south africa has not been excluded from the impact and devastation of the covid-19 pandemic. not only has the pandemic manifested as a health problem but has aggravated difficulty of access to decent housing, mainly in the urban areas. this paper reviews the responsiveness of various regulatory frameworks and institutional arrangements that serve as governance mechanisms in the development of low-income housing within the south african context. the paper analyses the impact of legislative and policy prescripts which seek to promote governance principles including, participation, transparency and accountability in the low-income housing delivery processes. institutional arguments are centred on institutions which structure action and constitute the interests and participation of actors without requiring authoritative intervention to achieve these regularities. the findings are that the legislative frameworks including the constitution of south africa and the housing act clearly articulate aspects of governance including citizen participation, accountability and transparency. however, the perspectives of the low-income housing beneficiaries through subsidized housing programmes demonstrate levels of dissatisfaction attributed to a lack of involvement, quality and other aspects. with the additional impact of the current pandemic, the study recommends that the housing policies need to take enforcement of governance principles into consideration.",governance,,"africa nana zd mhlongo phd candidate in engineering management faculty of engineering and built environment university of johannesburg johannesburg, south africa khensanyiko@gmail.com trynos gumbo head of department and associate professor university of johannesburg, department of urban and regional planning, office 6062, sixth floor, john orr building, beit and siemert street, 2028. johannesburg, south africa tgumbo@uj.ac.za innocent musonda associate professor – construction management director: centre for applied research + innovation in the built environment (carinbe) leader: eskom’s eppei specialization centre university of johannesburg, john orr building, doornfontein campus","References

539,Social Innovation To Promote Financial Inclusion In The  Microfinance Sector In Mexico,"this research aims to propose improvement actions to integrate social innovation in the microfinance sector to promote financial inclusion in mexico, to provide financial services to low-income people. since the infrastructure, the supply of financial products and services in mexico is highly concentrated in urban areas in the center and north of the country, for which there is the challenge of expanding them to a greater part of the population to reduce the income gap coverage in rural areas and in southern mexico. the research is descriptive, phenomenological, qualitative, and non-experimental. as a result of the investigation, a proposal for improvement actions was designed that integrates social innovation to promote financial inclusion in mexico. the proposal focuses on the use of technological applications that are being used in the country and is supported by social innovations identified in some successful cases in the microfinance sector worldwide.","social innovation, 2019) at present","The general objective of the research is to determine if the social innovation strategies used by the microfinance sector promote financial inclusion in Mexico, to provide financial services to low-income people. The cases of Bangladesh, Peru and Kenya with their bKash, Bim and M-Pesa applications, respectively, made it possible to point out innovative strategies applied in the microfinance sector with successful results that promoted financial inclusion through the identification of a greater number of people with mobile phones in the areas where they are located and that in some cases this model extends to other countries. All the above allowed the design of a proposal for social innovation actions so that the microfinance sector extends financial inclusion in Mexico; Well, knowing the origin of microcredit and the combination of social innovation and financial inclusion that other countries managed to successfully unite. The Codi application that currently works in Mexico was taken and that until today its use is generated by those account holders of some banking institution, excluding those who do not have a bank account. Therefore, by taking the best practices of applications such as bkash, Bim and M – Pesa and replicating them in the Codi application, there is a high probability of success and consequently that the microfinance sector extends financial inclusion in Mexico.

541,Musculoskeletal Risks For Using Smart Devices In Online  Study Of University Students,"the use of smart devices has become a basic necessity for college or university students mainly to attend to lectures, to access the digital material, and to complete given tasks or assignments or project. the longer use and wrong posture can adhere risks leading onto the conditions related to musculoskeletal disorders. the longer use can cause strain in the muscles and the tendons, bone, and joints. all of which can result in causing the pains. any such symptom is technically referred to as musculoskeletal symptoms. the main motivation is to support and educate the university students about the musculoskeletal disorder, its negative impact, and then suggest how the students can deal with strategies to overcome such pain. the topic of our research is ‘musculoskeletal risks for using smart devices in online study for university students’. through this study, risks among the students at university of sharjah is investigated. focusing on the ergonomics issues and university students, our research is contributing with other similar studies conducted in the uae. the sample considered is consisting of randomly selected students at university of sharjah. quantitative analysis is carried out with self-administered survey and posture analysis applying the well- known rapid upper limb assessment (rula) and rapid entire body assessment (reba) tools. the results have shown that most affected body parts are neck, upper back, and shoulder locations in majority of cases among university students. top three ache, pains or discomfort experience ‘several time every day’ are neck, upper back, and shoulder related. this is accounting for students experienced in neck are 10.85%, upper back is 7.16%, and shoulder are 6.7%. the results of posture analysis have provided evidence that students at university of sharjah are at musculoskeletal ‘medium risk’ with respect to their postures while using smart devices and further investigated is required.","(12 font) msd, msd disorder, bone","The aim of the project to examine the musculoskeletal symptoms among the university students that is caused due to the use of smart devices is fulfilled. Firstly, analyzing the ergonomic risk factors that are associated with the use of smart devices, it is found that majority of students 33% spends about 4 to 6 hours, 25% of students spent 6 to 8 hours, and 15% spent more than 8 hours. Secondly, the specific parts of the musculoskeletal system that are likely to be affected by the use of smart device among the University of Sharjah is observed to be neck, upper back and shoulder at the top three body parts affected. The results of RULA and REBA indicated that students at University of Sharjah are at musculoskeletal ‘Medium Risk’ with respect to their postures while using smart devices. This is showing there is need for further investigation and implementation of change of posture. Common recommendations are to take breaks, change body position (posture), keep the device on table, ergonomic standards and guidelines, and exercise like stretching to ensure body parts are moved not static all the time. Since neck, shoulder, and upper back body parts are observed in majority of the cases. Some of the below recommendations are given to reduce the risk associated with the use of smart devices related to identified body parts: • Using laptop table: this table ensures that the laptop can be place on the top of it and lets the user position in up-right-straight. This will provide the screen at good level and help in avoiding bending of neck or truck. • Using ergonomic tools like chair or device holders: the ergonomic chairs have good design which allow the back support such that when the back is rested on it, it takes the up-right-straight position. The device holders can help users to avoid long time static usage of device holder in hands. The risk associated with twisted hands can be avoided. • Using ergonomic neck support: this will let user feel comfortable at straight position.","sara alnaqbi, fatima alzarouni, dina al sowadi, rawan kittaneh and mohammad khadem department of industrial engineering and engineering management, university of sharjah, sharjah, uae mkhadem@sharjah.ac.ae",

543,How Do African Cities Benefit From Using Smart  Technologies? Perspectives From Local Government,"the fourth industrial revolution has immensely challenged cities across the world to review and recalibrate their strategies and systems of interfacing with their stakeholders. however, the problem is that the benefits of smart cities interventions are not well documented for african cities. this paper is interested in succinctly documenting these. this goal was achieved through a desktop literature review, as well as through empirically gathering and analyzing views of local government practitioners on the implementation of the smart city concept. in this regard, a case study of the city of tshwane, the capital city of south africa, was used. the study found that the ctmm is deriving benefits from the use of smart city technologies across the dimensions of social, economic, environmental, and governance. however, the benefits are not evenly distributed among the four dimensions. the ctmm seem to be deriving more governance and economic benefits from the use of smart cities and digital technologies, compared to the social benefits. however, these findings may need to be interpreted within the context of financial and governance challenges faced by the city of tshwane in the past 5 years.","smart cities, social justice",", Recommendations, and the Way Forward Most respondents were able to identify and categorize some of the benefits the CTMM is deriving in terms of using smart cities technologies in Tshwane. From the perspective of the economic benefits, these include the ability of technology to allow CTMM to use less amount of money to reach many people for public participatory meetings. As far as social benefits are concerned the use of smart technologies, especially Free-Wi-Fi, has assisted the youth in the City of Tshwane to socialize better. The provision of free Wi-Fi has allowed young people to socialize in parks, libraries, and other open spaces. With regards to environmental benefits, the fact that less paper is used means that there are fewer trees that are cut. This contributes to a positive impact on climate change; and gas emissions. Concerning governance benefits, the use of smart cities technologies has given the CTMM ability to respond faster and efficiently to service delivery challenges. With the introduction of the ‘Circular 9 electronic system’ for generating reports for Mayoral Committee and Council meetings, some efficiency gains have been seen. The Electronic Record Management System has brought benefits of information management and retrieving of reports and documents quickly and efficiently to enable faster decision making.","practitioners tlou phillemon mathane masters student, university of johannesburg, south africa phillemonmathane@gmail.com trynos gumbo head of department and associate professor university of johannesburg, department of urban and regional planning, office 6062, sixth floor, john orr building, beit and siemert street, 2028. johannesburg, south africa tgumbo@uj.ac.za",

548,"Design, Simulation, And Fabrication Of Steering Controlled  Headlight Mechanism","our design idea spawned from the increases in traffic accidents rate during nighttime driving on unlit roads. most unexpansive cars have fixed headlights that have blind spots that the headlight does not cover. we took a look in the market to see what are the solutions that the manufacturers provide and concluded that most solutions are expensive to the average population. so, we had a brainstorming session and came up with a design project idea. our project is based on a simple mechanism and it is low cost at the same time. which is the 4-bar mechanism. basically, we will weld a rod vertically on the steering arm that is connected to the tires. then we will construct our 4-bar the crank and rocker must be parallel and has the same length to make sure that both headlights turn at the same angle as the tires. then we will attach an extension pin to the headlight. we are aware of the tight spaces so we modeled our design on a specific pick-up car our mechanism should not alter any of the car`s functions or interfere with the under-carriage components of the vehicle. our design aims to make it affordable, safe, and reliable at the same time. the methodology we followed is to first outline the components of the mechanism and set the maximum dimensions of each part. second, we worked comprehensively on the design calculations needed such as degrees of freedom, stress analysis, and force analysis as well as choosing an appropriate material and an international standard. finally, we will construct a 3d model and simulate it to check if the mechanism passes the engineering program's tests. if necessary, changes will be made after the simulation. after that, the mechanism will be manufactured to conduct real-world experiments and determine the practicality of our design.","headlight, adaptive, mechanism","In conclusion, the full details of the project and standers are mention in the full project paper. We manage to design and simulate the 4-bar mechanism which tilt the headlight at an angle of 30ᵒ. Also, AISI 1010 HR steel is the main material to fulfill the target design, such as great formability, durability, and good tensile and yield strength. In addition, the purpose of selecting this mechanism is accomplishing lower required maintenance and financial cost compared to the other alternatives. After simulating the model, the calculating dimensions, stresses and factor of safety values is validated by their simulated values.

549,"Linking Sustainability, Resilience And Liveability With  Smart City Development: Modeling Interconnections Using","smart cities are the solutions to unfathomable urban challenges. however, urban planners skepticize the existing smart cities for not addressing sustainable development through practices of resilience planning and livable transformations. at the embryonic stage, it is vital for cities of today to gain a more consistent understanding on how resilience, liveability, and sustainability can be co-created into the smart city planning model under a unified umbrella. in that respect, this research attempts to understand smart city development through the lens of sustainability, urban resilience and liveability using a systems approach, as cities evolve to achieve the descriptive goal of “futuristic cities”. causal feedback loop diagrams were used to capture the dynamic interactions among multiple drivers within the urban context under the sustainability, resilience, and liveability models. the proposed feedback structures and interactions can help smart city planners and urban developers to transform the existing smart cities of today to a much aspiring futuristic cities we want.","liveability, resilience, smart city, sustainability, system thinking",,"systems approach adeeb a. kutty, murat kucukvar, galal m. abdella mechanical and industrial engineering department college of engineering, qatar university doha, qatar akutty@qu.edu.qa, mkucukvar@qu.edu.qa, gmg5005@qu.edu.qa najeeba kutty architectural engineering department college of engineering, united arab emirates university al-ain, united arab emirates 202090186@uaeu.ac.ae nuri c. onat qatar transportation and traffic safety centre college of engineering, qatar university doha, qatar onat@qu.edu.qa",
550,Automatic Agile Transformation With Approach By  Modeling From Bpmn Collaboration Diagram Model To,"in this paper we propose an automatic and agile transformation method from the cim level to the pim level respecting the mda approach and agile transformation rules. the proposal mainly focuses on the creation of a cim level from the defined rules that allow the realization of rich models containing all the important information to facilitate the transformation to the pim level. then, we propose to define the agile transformation rules from the cim level to the pim level, through passage rules and agile transformation rules, this method respects the mda approach, by creating the business dimension at the cim level through the use of bpmn via the collaboration and business process diagrams, defining the passage rules and agile transformation rules, to finally obtain a pim recommended by mda using uml use case and class diagrams.","cim, pim, bpmn","and future work For software development, one of the main challenges is to define an approach that allows the transition from models that describe the functioning of a company to models that present the analysis and design of the software while remaining in permanent contact with the client to exchange and accept change requests at several stages of the process. The objective of our article is to present an approach based on MDA models, and to provide a solution to the different transformation problems from the CIM analysis and design level presented in our article by the collaboration diagram, to the PIM modelled models level presented in our article by the use case diagram using an agile method presented by the different sprints in order not to burden the transformation process. For our future work, we will work on the agile transformation from the PIM level to the PSM level, in order to generate the software source code in the end.

551,Hr Digitalization As A Critical Hr Practice To Navigate  Through Covid-19 For The Improvement Of The Employee Job,"although digitalization of hr is popular nowadays, it is still in its infancy stage and studied by relatively less researchers. however, its significance has been more realized during the latest epidemic of covid-19 as companies have to depend on working-from-home environment and moved toward digitalization in a tremendous speed. the main focus of this paper is to review the concept of hr digitalization, its advantages and disadvantages, the obstacles to implement hr digitalization. moreover, the paper will also investigate the effect of hr digitalization on the employee job performance. the review revealed that hr digitalization has revolutionized the world hrm through the effective and efficient use of the social networking and internet websites. in addition, digitalization of hrm is not an easy decision or process before which the organizations have to consider many aspects and characteristics as well as to do much research and evaluation because there are several factors that participate into the successful implementation of the digitalized systems. furthermore, digitalization of hr provides operational advantages but also other relational benefits, and more or less enhances from the employee job performance.","covid-19, hr, digitalization",,"performance: review paper ahmed saleh ahmed saif al-shameri, siti sarah binti omar faculty of technology management and business universiti tun hussein onn malaysia johor, malaysia ahmedalshameri54@yahoo.com, sarah@uthm.edu.my",
552,Pattern Pathfinding Algorithms To Tackle Effective  Route Navigation,"food and parcel delivery routing is a major problem area due to its dynamism and complexity, exacerbated in recent years by growth in demand. the problem was modelled as a variation of the op, a classical combinatorial optimisation problem, specifically the otop, involving a team of vehicles where each vehicle has a time budget to serve locations. a hybridisation of the metaheuristics simulated annealing and iterated local search (sails) was constructed, able to escape local optima by sometimes accepting worse solutions. a website was also created to showcase the algorithm and computational tests were conducted on instances with varying parameters to simulate the large breadth of real- world scenarios. sails had higher profit than ils and the initial solution and was able to acquire 58.8% of the profit increase over 20 minutes of runtime within 5 seconds, showing efficiency. however, the low improvement of sails over ils shows sails has much room for improvement. possible future work includes creating a more representative model with fewer assumptions and improving the algorithm through methods like reheating, genetic algorithms, and more precise parameter tuning. in short, a sails pathfinding algorithm was constructed to effectively and efficiently tackle delivery routing.",,"In summary, SAILS was successfully applied to the context of food delivery routing modelled as the Open TOP, demonstrating its potential as an effective and efficient routing algorithm. With further improvement of the algorithms and more consideration of real-world constraints, it could become a viable approach to delivery routing, increasing its efficiency and providing greater convenience for businesses and customers alike. It could also accelerate the growth of food delivery services while relieving the overwork many delivery riders experience. As the first study within our knowledge to apply SAILS to the delivery routing context and do so successfully, we believe we have made a unique contribution.

554,Risk Analysis Of Methanol Transfer Process By Hazard And  Operability Study (Hazop) Method In Biodiesel Plant,"accidents in the chemical process industry can not only result in loss of life (fatality) and property but can also cause irreparable damage (assets and the environment) to the external environment. for companies whose industrial activities are processing, storing, distributing, transporting and using hazardous chemicals to carry out a risk analysis of the potential hazards of chemicals, and the stages of hazard identification against chemicals are steps to prevent industrial accidents and also as a form of prevention. against work accidents and occupational diseases. the purpose of this study is to analyze the risk of chemical hazards in the methanol transfer process in each operating process based on the p&id diagram document and to determine the potential hazards of chemicals in the process so that hazard control can be applied. this study focuses on the methanol transfer process in biodiesel companies using the hazard and operability study (hazop) method. the results of the analysis after it was done that the value of before reduction after the application of safeguards on each item of the methanol and sodium methylate daily tank process, the results of the after reduction risk assessment on the risk value changed from a risk score of 20 to a risk score of 16. based on the results of the risk analysis it can be seen that the risk analysis using the hazop method after safeguarding is obtained with an average risk level of moderate risk of 40%, low of 32% and high of 28%.","osh, chemical hazardous, hazop","That the results of the risk analysis using hazop can be seen using several very detailed hazard analysis methods because all installations from input, process and output are part of the hazard identification process. One of the most structured and detailed methods used is the HAZOP (Hazard and Operability Analysis) method, where each operation process is based on the P&ID Diagram document. From the application of Hazard Identification, the result is that the Risk Score Before Reduction value is still on average 20 and after the application of safeguards is then scored, the result is that the Risk Score after Reduction is 16 and this requires special attention in the Node 3 section of the Methanol and Sodium Methylate Daily Tank plant operation process. It is necessary to take steps to improve the results that are still at high risk, namely to carry out a Mitigation Step plan in the form of a Hazop Recommendation. Hazop Recommendation is a form of strategy implementation for the implementation of hazardous chemical control and OSH as the end result of efforts to improve and reduce Risk in the Methanol and Sodium Methylate Daily Tank process. That hazard identification and risk assessment must be carried out in every operating process in the chemical industry to determine and be able to estimate the potential hazards and risks faced.

560,Identify The Key Success Factors And Enabling Strategies For  Successful Blockchain Implementation In Supply Chain,"blockchain is one of the emerging trends that could transform supply chains making it robust and secure. effective management of supply chains is crucial in industries such as finance, healthcare, food, and logistics not just at a time of pandemic but also for routine operations. supply chain processes are potential sources of competitive advantage for firms in a highly competitive market. blockchain in supply chains will be a disruptive innovation that could significantly transform supply chains. implementing blockchain could reduce costs, reduce administrative and logistical errors, speed up the processes and make the entire supply chain very dynamic and streamlined to all stakeholders. this paper aims to understand how various firms from different industries have effectively implemented blockchain technologies in their supply chain processes to improve transparency, integrity, and accessibility. information asymmetry is quite common in supply chains and is a serious issue in current times especially during an ongoing pandemic. blockchain could also aid in minimizing information asymmetry at different stages of the supply chain. this paper using a case study approach aims to highlight how different industries strategically use blockchain to their competitive advantage.","blockchain, supply chain, strategic benefits","We aimed to highlight on the adoption of blockchain for supply chain activities and the operational strategies that contributed to market competitive advantages in various industries in this research paper. Our model of the study was to use case studies and understand the work of blockchain on various industries, upon reading the cases, prominent success factors emerged and were captured. Common success factors can be seen across industries, however, using it to their strategic advantage is narrowed down to organizations. The understanding of where and how to leverage blockchain is very crucial to reap the maximum cost and value benefits. This is where our study of enabling strategies helps to identify the niche area of an industry where blockchain can be used. However, during our case analysis, there were also several challenges organizations faced to adapt to blockchain technology and the same was understood. This study can be furthered with more narrowed down industries and the niche markets they function in to help industries easily take up this emerging technology.","saranya muthuraj mba-ms student amrita school of business amrita vishwa vidyapeetham university bengaluru, india saranyamuthuraj1695@gmail.com dr. shekar babu phd professor & founding head amrita vishwa vidyapeetham university bengaluru, india sb@amrita.edu shijith kumar pm assistant professor solbridge international school of business, woosong university daejeon, south korea shijith.pm@solbridge.ac.kr",

563,Business Responsibility And Sustainability Reporting   (Brsr) – An Exploratory Study,"due to the increasing environmental and social concerns worldwide, there has been a major shift in the reporting standards in the last decade. this has created a need to look more closely into the reporting issues to be addressed by a country like india. as part of its efforts to improve the environment social and governance (esg) disclosures, new criteria for sustainability reporting were introduced by sebi. these reporting criteria which were to be followed by the top - 1000 publicly listed companies, were termed as brsr – “business responsibility and sustainability reporting”. in this paper, the authors present discussions on the background and introduction of brsr, the parameters of evolution of sustainability reporting from business responsibility reporting (brr) to brsr, as well as the enhancements brought in by brsr. the authors conducted an exploratory study that provides a comprehensive description of brsr in india along with a critical overview of the various modifications from brr to brsr. we examined information disclosed in reports of the committee on business responsibility reporting, sustainability reporting standards board (the institute of chartered accountants of india based). in their pursuit to be ethically, socially and environmentally responsible, the aim of the indian companies is to reach higher disclosure levels with the brsr implementation. brsr seems comprehensive, globally relevant and is based on specific quantifiable metrics. this should help tell the holistic esg story of each reporting company. while the ‘proof of the pudding is in the eating’, the indian regulators are taking strong strides toward sustainability.",esg reporting,"In order to ensure that the businesses recognize their responsibility toward the environment and the society, nonfinancial disclosures are gaining prominence alongside annual financial disclosures. With more importance being given to sustainability disclosures, such non-financial information is used by credit agencies, banks, etc., along with financial information while assessing the credit-worthiness of the companies. It will take a while to understand whether the BRSR will be a reliable tool that would serve as the main criteria for assessment of businesses and whether it will meet the expectations of the regulators. Features such as BRSR Lite, the MCA21 portal and Business Responsibility-Sustainability Index mentioned in its consultation paper and Committee Report are not discussed by the SEBI BRSR Circular. The transition from BRR to BRSR might become simpler if these key features are included. It will help the key stakeholders in ranking the companies based on their ESG performance and disclosures. SEBI has given the current fiscal year as a respite for the companies that have been doing the BRR thus far. It is up to the companies to either continue with the existing BRR, so that they remain compliant or to adopt the new BRSR a year before it is made compulsory. It would be useful to include a review of the key requisites of the BRSR, so that the transition from BRR to BRSR is smooth and well-planned. In countries like China, the US, UK and European Union, there are about 400 sustainability reporting instruments available. They are taking the right steps to make even the non-financial disclosures compulsory.

571,“I Chose Vocational Teacher Education Because”. Exploring  The Factors Influencing The Choice Of Education Amongst,"passion for teaching is one of the aspects of the teaching profession. the literature showed that teachers’ passion is one of the essential factors to become quality prospective teachers and retaining them in the profession. therefore, this passion must exist since being a student. however, not all vocational pre-teacher students are interested to become teachers, some of them are interested to become engineers or entrepreneurs. this research aims to investigate factors influencing the choice of education amongst pre-teacher students. the first-year pre-teacher’s students (n = 76) were surveyed to investigate the influenced factors for choosing vocational teacher education institutions. exploratory factor analyses were used to examine influencing factors for choosing vocational teacher education institutions. the results showed that passion to be an engineer is the strongest influential factor. this finding is contrary to graduates' profile of vocational teacher education institutions that most graduates will become vocational teachers. the relationships between personal motivations, passion to be a teacher or engineer, and participants’ perceptions for future demand are discussed as well.",,"The research findings support quality improvement of vocational pre-teacher education within in Indonesian university context. While we are mindful of the study limitation that main data were gathered only from one university, so further research is necessary to study more aspects. Various aspects of what drives teachers are presented by Day (Day, 2004) that passion in teaching is one of the important aspects of a professional teacher. Similar results have been studied by other researcher (Rampa, 2012) that passion is the core of teaching. Passion is related to interest, thoughtfulness, commitment, and optimism, which its key characteristics of effectiveness in teaching activities. The results of this present study highlight the substantial influence that participants’ preceding teaching and learning experiences, as well as their perceived ability, had on their decision to pursue a teaching career. However, it was ones’ passion to be an engineer, which was the strongest positive predictor of career choice for these first-year vocational pre-teacher education students. This result was contrast with the pre-teacher education institutions (LPTK) objectives. Based on law No. 14 of 2005 article 1 No.14 that pre-teacher education institutions objectives are to conduct teacher educational programs. This motivations profile for people entering vocational teacher education programs in Indonesian universities suggests that they choose more to be an engineer than a teacher. Instead, it is clear that passion in teaching is important due to the graduated profile of vocational pre-teacher education institutions is to provide vocational teacher rather than an engineer. Hence, we argue that it is a mandatory aspect to get professional vocational teachers.","vocational pre-teacher students in indonesia towip towip mechanical engineering education department faculty of teacher training and education universitas sebelas maret surakarta, indonesia towip@staff.uns.ac.id andri setiyawan mechanical engineering department faculty of engineering universitas negeri semarang semarang, indonesia andrisetiyawan@mail.unnes.ac.id",

573,Exploring The Impact Of Design Thinking On The  Development Of Computational Thinking Skill: Review Of,"as an ideal medium for the development of 21st-century skills, computational thinking is commonly developed through computer science practices such as programming and robotics. among the vast literature on computational thinking, few of them address the strategy to implement design thinking to facilitate the development of computational thinking. this study investigates whether design thinking can facilitate the development of computational thinking based on a systematic literature review as a method of this research. the author identifies the literature that can be used as a reference in this study, analyzes the development of computational thinking skill, and looks for its correlation with design thinking—both design thinking and computational thinking to support problem-solving skills through a structured thinking approach.","design thinking, literature review",". From the twenty manuscripts examined, all of the research reports provide evidence for all the abilities. It can be concluded that design thinking affects individual ability in Computational Thinking. It is apparent that Design Thinking influences the ability of Computational Thinking through the process of Design Thinking: (1) empathize, (2) define, (3) ideate, (4) prototype, (5) test. Those steps generate creativity, problem-solving, collaboration, and empathy that also intersect with the abilities of Computational Thinking. Design thinking enhances students’ confidence to deal with complexity and persistence to work over complex issues. The critical and technical aspect of the skill enables students to resolve ambiguity and gears them to solve open-ended problems. The social ability aspect of design thinking aspires students to acknowledge team members' differences while collaborating to achieve a standard solution. They are also introduced to the ability to recognize team members’ strengths and weaknesses when collaborating with others.","the literature maryam fadhilllah naylufarhani hardjanto, cucuk budiyanto, and yusfia hafid aristyagama department of informatics education sebelas maret university surakarta, indonesia maryam@student.uns.ac.id, cbudiyanto@staff.uns.ac.id, yusfia.hafid@staff.uns.ac.id",

575,Digital Transformation Readiness In Higher Education  Institutions In Indonesia: A Systematic Literature Review,"digital transformation is a process of accelerating and integrating digital technology spread across society. this process changes lifestyles by utilising a combination of information technology, communication, compilation, and connectivity. although digital transformation has become a worldwide topic lately, little research still discusses it in indonesia. however, indeed, digital transformation has occurred in indonesian higher education. this study's purpose is to analyse the readiness of higher education in indonesia to face digital transformation. this research was conducted with a systematic literature review framework with a prisma approach for selecting the article and thematic analysis for data analysed. the data analysed will be focused on educational stakeholders, namely students, teachers, and institutions. in students' focus, we discovered a theme, namely flexibility learning, that means students can study every time and everywhere without restriction. we also found one theme in the teacher's focus: trained teachers, which means teachers must have competencies to adapt to digital transformation. and finally, four themes were found in institutions focus, namely creating educational platforms, managing data, managing it infrastructure, and overcoming cultural barriers. we can realise the four themes through online classes and a change in mindset at the university.","higher education, prisma approach","This study aims to analyse the readiness of Indonesian higher education to face digital transformation with stakeholders as the focus. In students' focus, we discovered a theme, namely flexibility learning, that means students can study every time and everywhere without restriction. We also found one theme in the teacher's focus: trained teachers, which means teachers must have competencies to adapt to digital transformation. Finally, four themes were found in institutions focus, namely creating educational platforms, managing data, managing IT infrastructure, and overcoming cultural barriers. We can realise the four themes through online classes and a change in mindset at the university. The result shows that institutions must prepare online classes and change the learning mindset to face digital transformation. Universities are the key to the success of the digital transformation. After all, service and teaching activities that occur are regulated by the university. The willingness of teachers and students to participate in digital transformation is dependent on their universities too. Digital transformation forced teachers to think and implement digital technology in the learning process. Teachers are required to increase their competencies and develop technology-based learning media. Therefore, teachers need support from the institution to improve their competence. And students enjoy a new learning system using digital technology. Students do not feel disadvantaged by learning digital technology and accept the recent learning culture changes.

577,A Systematic Review Of Iot Platforms In Educational  Processes,"the use of iot for teaching and learning processes begins to increase. to support the use of the iot device itself, a platform can be used. the iot platform gives iot components the ability to self-regulate so they can help beginners or students deploy iot devices. nevertheless, the current state of knowledge in using iot platforms within the educational field is limited. therefore, we want to elaborate on how iot platforms are used to support iot educational learning tools and enhance educational processes. the research method used is a systematic review and prisma is being used as a research protocol. after fifteen articles are screened based on their qualification, we found there are seven platforms frequently mentioned, research results show these learning tools increase students’ interest in the subject as well as provide new knowledge of iot in educational processes for both engineering and non-engineering fields.","iot, iot platform, education, systematic review","This review focuses on the IoT platform's usage in educational processes especially teaching and learning processes by conducting a systematic review. 15 articles relevant to the topic are screened and analysed. Research results show that there are many benefits that can be provided by using the IoT platforms, not only introducing new technology in the form of IoT devices to students but also increasing student interest and improving the quality of teaching. Node-Red IoT platform is the most used due to its function that can collect data as well as visualize it on an online platform and helps students to easily understand or operate the device themselves and raise the student interest in the subject. Based on the purposes, it can be categorized into learning media and teaching tools. The subject targets used for the implementation of the IoT platform are not only limited to IoT or programming lessons, in point of fact, but IoT platforms also helped enhance both engineering and non-engineering subjects. The IoT platform has been proven to help improve the learning and teaching processes and it is important to introduce IoT technology even at the educational level due to the urgency of overcoming technology changes. Therefore, there is a need for future work to increase the number of learning frameworks using the IoT platform. Learning frameworks can be established in the form of an IoT-based laboratory, IoT-based teaching devices, or integrating electrical devices with IoT as students’ projects. As well as analyze the urgency of considering the introduction of IoT technology as one of our education curricula.","irene cittaning laksmi, puspanda hatta, and endar suprih wihidayat faculty of teacher training and education sebelas maret university surakarta, indonesia irenecitta@student.uns.ac.id, hatta.puspanda@staff.uns.ac.id, endars@staff.uns.ac.id",

583,Addressing Computational Thinking Needs' Of Visually  Impaired Children,"computational thinking skill is advocated for children for their general problem-solving ability. however, children with vision deficiency are restrained from developing their computational thinking skills as the recently available tools do not cater for people with disability. this paper aims to address the need for computational thinking in children with visual impairments. this paper uses a literature review method following the systematic literature review framework by collecting relevant articles on the development of computational thinking skills in blind children. fourteen empirical reports published between 2017-2020 were aggregated from google scholar and scopus. the papers, then analyzed using a critical analysis approach. the analysis reveals that children with visual impairment are largely overlooked in the computational thinking literature. despite the vast amount of media facilitating computational thinking skills, only a few technologies accommodate children with visual disabilities. they are not only involved in shaping the characteristics of basic computing abilities but also encourage blind children to cultivate a passion for learning and encourage future spatial and computational thinking skills.","algorithm, child education, programming skill",,"mey tias andry pamungkas, cucuk wawan budiyanto, and suharno vocational teacher education faculty of teacher training and education universitas sebelas maret surakarta, indonesia meytiasandry@student.uns.ac.id, cbudiyanto@staff.uns.ac.id, suharno71@staff.uns.ac.id",
584,Evaluation Of Mobile-Based Learning Media Application For  Python Programming Learning,"various applications of python programming learning on the google play making this programming learning resources easy to accessed. this study aims to evaluate various mobile applications that are used as learning media for python programming. the evaluation is carried out based on the usability aspect to measure the level of usability and aspects of learning achievement to measure the level of application suitability based on the accuracy with student learning outcomes. this study used a qualitative approach with a grounded theory. the data source in this research is a mobile application that contains python programming learning. data analysis was carried out through several stages, namely observation, filtering, and application scoring based on an assessment using the learning object review instrument (lori). meanwhile, the ranking of data is measured using a likert scale. the results of this study show that the python programming learning media available on the google play is of good quality in terms of learning outcomes. the average score from this aspect is 36.50 out of 40.00 with a percentage of 91% from 85 applications, therefore it falls into the very suitable category (has good material). on the other hand, in terms of usability, the average score obtained was 63.62 out of 80.00 with a percentage of 75% of 85 applications, making it to be included in the category of feasible use with some improvements. the high rating of an application on the google play store does not affect the analysis results because 60% of applications, namely 50 of the total 85 applications that have high ratings on the google play store, have high ratings on the results of the analysis. in addition, at the end of the paper, the five best python learning applications with the highest usability scores and aspects of learning outcomes are presented.",mobile application,"Following a systematic review of several previous research articles discussing STEAM learning and constructivism approaches, it was discovered that STEAM can be integrated with several learning methods, with project-based learning methods being one of the most dominant methods for defining steam's integrated education objectives because project- based learning emphasizes the importance of learning. Increase interest in and assist students in developing the skills they will require in the workplace. Furthermore, constructivism-based learning outcomes produce nearly identical results for students, such as the ability to increase collaboration, independence, responsibility, comprehensive thinking, and cognitive abilities of other students. However, none of the articles organized by topic have comprehensively discussed how to integrate STEAM or the constructiveness approach, so more in-depth research on integrating STEAM with basic learning competencies using a constructivism approach with project-based learning methods will be conducted. Figure 3. Application Percentage Results Based on Figure 3, it is known that the overall the results of the analysis and evaluation of mobile applications on the Google Play Store are good and suitable for use as learning media for Python programming as they are in accordance with the aspects of usability and learning outcomes. Conformity with learning outcomes is very good, the material is completely presented, with orderly presentation, in accordance with the objectives, activities, assessment, and student characteristics as evidenced by the presentation results of the content quality aspect which is 91% and the learning aspect of goal alignment of 89%. The lowest score is in the learning aspect (learning goal alignment) on indicators of learning activities. Some applications that have low scores on these indicators have limited learning activities in these applications. Conformity with usability aspects can be declared suitable for use, but it is better if improvements are made in several aspects. The average number of usability is 63.62 with a percentage of 75%. The feedback and adaptation aspects (feedback goal alignment) have a total score of 234 out of a total score of 425 with a percentage of 55%. This indicates that half of the applications analyzed are less than optimal and need to be improved. There are even some applications that do not have feedback and adaptation aspects (feedback goal alignment). The motivation aspect has a total score of 226 out of a total score of 425 with a percentage of 53%. As with the previous aspects, the motivation aspect needs to be improved in order to further motivate its users. For example, by adding content that is relevant to the goals and personal interests of the intended learner, adding interactive learning activities or adding challenges such as tests, practice questions, coding exercises, games and quizzes and adding features that may pull interests. The presentation design aspect has a total score of 451 out of a total score of 850 with a percentage of 53%. Low scores on this aspect occur because of the aesthetic value or lack of production. For example, there is unclear writing, errors in text and fonts, misalignment in size selection, and poor video or audio quality. Therefore, it is necessary to improve the presentation design aspects. There are nine indicators on the usage interaction aspect. This aspect has a total score of 3007 out of a total score of 3825 with a percentage of 88%. The indicator on the usage interaction aspect that has the lowest number is the quality of the help feature. There are two indicators on the accessibility aspect. The total score in this aspect is 689 out of a total score of 850 with a percentage of 81%. The aspect of easy access to applications is already good. The reuse and standard compliance aspects have a total score of 389 sequentially from a total score of 425 with a percentage of 91% and 412 of a total score of 425 with a percentage of 97%. This means that the applications are good in both aspects. Of the 85 applications, there are two applications that have the lowest score which is ""0"". Both applications cannot be opened after installation. The next lowest score is 62, namely the ""Learn OOP Python"" from Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management Istanbul, Turkey, March 7-10, 2022 IEOM Society International 5304","fadilla shinta devi, puspanda hatta, and rosihan ariyuana department of informatics education the faculty of teacher training and education universitas sebelas maret surakarta, indonesia fadillashinta@student.uns.ac.id, hatta.puspanda@staff.uns.ac.id, rosihanari@staff.uns.ac.id","references based on their experience while using it. In addition, this preference is also based on 
the user's psychological and emotional state when interacting with the application without analyzing usability aspects

Based on the evaluation results, there are five recommendations for the best Python learning applications, they are 
“Learn Python: Programmiz”, “Learn Python Programming - Offline Tutorial”, “Learn Python - Quiz & Top Interview 
Questions”, “Python Foundation Learning: Python Tutorials”, and “Learn Python: Python Tutorial”. Based on this 
research, there is a suggestion for further research to conduct a special evaluation of the user interface satisfaction of an 
application. It is because with a creative learning design, learning media applications may be able to be more innovative, 
interesting, and further increase user interest in learning.

585,System Detection Ripeness Of Fresh Fruits Bunch Palm Oil  With Yolov4,"the harvest of oil palm fresh fruit bunches (ffb), especially in indonesia, is determined manually, mainly based on the color and number of fallen fruit. information technology innovation can help determine harvest time quite accurately and consistently. computer visuals are one method that predicts can detect oil palm fruit maturity. the importance of the ability to detect objects directly, especially in oil palm plantations, is certainly a challenge. yolov4 can observe any changes indirect objects properly and quickly and even has a very deep model structure making it very suitable for detecting bunch maturity. ffb has a maturity level which is referred to as a fraction. there are 3 fractions analyzed in yolov4 to fraction 1, fraction 2, and fraction 3. based on the study results, the yolov4 method was able to detect the maturity level of bunches of fraction 1, fraction 2, and fraction 3 with an accuracy of map@0.50 of 99.17% map@0.75 of 97.08% at the checkpoint weight of 6000. in study has disadvantaged unbalanced data set due to the difficult terrain in the field and the lack of resources due to the pandemic. the result model learning can develop to predict ripeness fruits bunch real-time with smartphone or raspberry.","deep learning, object detection, palm oil, ripeness bunches","and Future Direction In this paper, the YOLOv4 is used to assist in detecting the maturity of bunches based on levels in fraction 1, fraction 2, and fraction 3 because it has the most optimal level of fruit maturity for harvesting. The YOLOv4 method produces checkpoint weights as a model that can be used for cluster object detection. Judging from the AP and mAP accuracy results, the checkpoint weights at 6000 get better accuracy than other checkpoints. For AP@0.50 mature category, fraction_1 and fraction_3 have 100% accuracy, and fraction_2 has 97% accuracy with a mAP@0.50 value of 99%. Meanwhile, at AP@0.75 mature category, fraction_1 has 93% accuracy, fraction_2 has 97% accuracy, and fraction_3 has 100% accuracy with a mAP@0.75 value of 97%. These results explain that YOLOv4 can detect class objects' ripeness level of bunches accurately and adequately. However, in this study, many shortcomings still need to be corrected: 1. Get proportional image data by proper digital cameras (DSLR) to improve the quality of images. Therefore, enriching features in the model training process because the results of DSLR cameras are sharper than smartphone cameras. 2. The need for consideration in data acquisition for bunches that have disturbances, such as midribs and fibres that cover bunches. It is essential because if this model is developed in a visual robotic fruit picker, real cases such as this are designed in a visual, mechanical fruit picker. In the future, it must satisfactorily resolve this disorder. 3. Improvements need to be made by trying several other detection methods such as Faster R-CNN, YOLOv1- v3, SSD, RetinaNet, and so on to compare the performance of the detection model. The issue of the imbalanced dataset is not easy to avoid. Like a case in this research, where collected image very difficult of the terrain and limited resources make the data unbalanced. Therefore, it is necessary to make improvements in the image acquisition process. Alternatively, can use image augmentation techniques to make the image balanced.","ahmad sopian student in computer science faculty of math and sciences ipb university bogor, indonesia amsopian22ahmad@apps.ipb.ac.id kudang boro seminar professor in mechanical & biosystem engineer faculty of agriculture and technology ipb university bogor, indonesia kseminar@apps.ipb.ac.id sudradjat profesor in agronomy and holticulture faculty of agriculture ipb university bogor , indonesia sudradjat@apps.ipb.ac.id",

587,Local Adaptive Curriculum Model (Lacm) As An  Alternative To Address Competency Gap Between,"according to the central statistics agency data, the number of unemployed in august 2020 reached 9.77 million, with vocational high school (smk) graduates contributing 13.55% of the total. the ministry of education and culture has revitalized smk through an internship program in the industry for link and match program. however, in its implementation, it was found a problem that the learning curriculum in schools did not match the needs of the industry. this study uses qualitative research with open-end questions through in-depth interviews and focus group discussions (fgd) with respondents, i.e., teachers, students, communities majoring in engineering in semarang, yogyakarta, jakarta, bandung, surabaya, and malang. in addition, the purposive sampling method was used to determine respondents from the ict field majoring in software engineering, animation, visual communication design, and multimedia. the result is recommendations for local adaptive curriculum models for vocational high schools (smk). this model would adjust the competencies needed to ensure the competencies of smk graduates meet industry needs. the local adaptive curriculum includes continuous development, implementation, and assessment processes through collaboration between government, vocational schools, and industry.","adaptive curriculum, vocational school, unemployment","From the study on the local adaptive curriculum model above, the following conclusions can be drawn: • The development of an adaptive curriculum can be carried out by decentralization in accordance with the competence needs of local industries that have been vocational school partners while still taking into account the standardization of the national curriculum and work competency standards on a local, national, and international level. Competencies adapted to the industry's position/role and job description serve as the main foundation for adaptive curriculum development. • Implementing the local adaptive curriculum model in vocational schools should be supported by a case study learning program or project-based learning (PBL) with mentors/coaches from the industry. • The Center of Excellence (COE) program for vocational schools launched in 2020 is an opportunity for vocational schools to develop adaptive curriculum further since the government has officially encouraged the development and implementation of the adaptive curriculum in collaboration with the industry. • Project-based learning (PBL) and internship programs are practical and effective ways to improve student's academic and work skills.

588,The Influence Of Replacement Of Fine Aggregates With  Slag Waste On Content Weight And Compressive Strength,"road construction is increasing time to time, causing the demand for paving blocks to boost. on the other hand, the metal casting industry is also experiencing an increase, which negatively impacts the form of slag waste with a high enough silica content. therefore, it is hoped that the hydration process between cement and fine aggregate forms an interface or maximum strength. this study aims to determine the effect of using slag as fine aggregate with replacement variations of 0%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, and 65% of the paving blocks’ content weight and compressive strength. this research conducted experimental quantitative descriptive methods. in this study, the independent variables consisted of slag replacement variations of 0%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, and 65% of the paving block volume and the dependent variables were compressive strength. based on the research results, the use of slag with replacement variations of 0%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, and 65% of the paving blocks’ volume could affect the paving blocks’ content weight and compressive strength. paving blocks with the replacement of slag produced normal content weight in all percentages, and produced maximum compressive strength value was 42 mpa at 50% slag replacement of the paving blocks’ volume.","content weight, paving block","The conclusions that could be obtained from the data analysis results and discussion in this study are: a) Paving blocks with slag replacement variations of 0%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, and 65% could affect the paving blocks’ content weight contunue encreased. b) Paving blocks with slag replacement variations of 0%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, and 65% could affect the paving blocks’ compressive strength by 86.48%, or 40 MPA and category of quality A. 6. Suggestion The suggestions proposed by the researchers based on the research that has been conducted are as follows: a) The replacement of slag on a paving block should pay attention to the size of the slag grains because it can affect the paving block’s strength. b) Slag waste refinement should use a machine. c) The use of slag waste as a replacement paving block should be socialized to the community to reduce slag or metal casting waste in saving the environment. d) Research is needed on how to neutralize slag waste so that it does not categorize it into hazardous waste. e) The use of slag waste in paving blocks can be further developed to produce better quality paving blocks. f) Innovations for using waste as a substitute for paving blocks can be continuously developed so that the other waste than slag waste can be better managed.","in paving block sukatiman, ida nugroho saputro, and ma’ruf mahmudi departement of civil engineering education sebelas maret university surakarta, indonesia sukatiman@staff.uns.ac.id, idanugroho@staff.uns.ac.id, mahmudi@gmail.co.id",

592,Relations Between Indonesia And China: Vaccine Diplomacy  In The Era Of The Covid-19 Pandemic,"at present, the world is being overshadowed by the spread of covid-19 transmission, which causes a large number of victims to be infected and die. according to the world health organization (who), covid-19 has been declared a pandemic. health diplomacy can be said to be diplomacy that is rarely carried out, but with the covid-19 pandemic, diplomacy is being carried out again, one of which is through vaccine diplomacy. this was then carried out by indonesia and china, where the two countries carried out vaccine diplomacy as an effort to stop the spread of the virus and improve the health of their respective citizens. this condition certainly shows that the current health issue is one of the things that cannot be denied from playing the interests of many countries in the world. therefore, this paper will discuss the cooperation between indonesia and china through vaccine diplomacy in order to meet the needs of vaccines in indonesia. this paper uses the theory of health diplomacy to help analyze the data. the method that will be used in this paper is a qualitative approach. keyword: indonesian, china, covid-19, vaccine diplomacy, health diplomacy. proceedings of the international conference on industrial engineering and operations management istanbul, turkey, march 7-10, 2022 ieom society international 5358",,,"ratu ulfatunisa international reltions student faculty of social and political science universitas nasional jakarta, indonesia ratuulfatunisa@gmail.com irma indrayani lecturer in international relations faculty of social and political science universitas nasional jakarta, indonesia irma.indrayani@civitas.unas.ac.id (corresponding author)",
593,Parliamentary Threshold In Multi-Party System In  Indonesia,"the multiparty system is an obstacle that must be addressed. one of the instruments that can be used to transform the party system and presumably strengthen the presidential system implemented in indonesia is the parliamentary threshold (parliamentary threshold). the parliamentary threshold is believed to be able to reduce the number of political parties that will enter representative institutions. so that there will be a simplification of the number of parties in the dpr with fewer parties, the support for the party system to the building of the presidential system that is adopted will be stronger. the research method used in this study is a literature review of various journal articles and books on parliamentary thresholds. the results of this study are the consequences of the multiparty system not only affecting the mechanism and efficiency of the discussion of draft laws and draft regional regulations in the dpr or dprd, but also the government bureaucracy that must be held by many people as representatives of the winning political parties in the general election. people's representatives who sit in the legislature and government will fight for the aspirations of their supporters who are very varied. among the impacts of the multiparty system that is important to note is the necessity of forming a governing coalition, which in practice in the past made it difficult for the government to set strategic policies because it took into account many factors.","parliamentary, threshold, multi-party system, turkey","In practice, since post-independence until now, the parliamentary threshold has not had a major impact on the simplification of political parties in parliament. In fact, multi-party is an absolute necessity that must be accepted which is seen as a normality in the era of Indonesian elections and democracy. The reality is that the implementation of the parliamentary threshold as a legal policy from 2009 to 2019 has not been able to reduce the number of political parties in parliament. This means that we must eliminate the view that the implementation of the parliamentary threshold is a surefire way to simplify political parties. On the other hand, the application also cannot stop the growth of political parties in Indonesia. Election history has noted that political parties will continue to grow as democracy in Indonesia develops.",djoni gunanto political science faculty of social and political sciences university of muhammadiyah jakarta djoni.gunanto@umj.ac.id ma'mun murod political science faculty of social and political sciences university of muhammadiyah jakarta muhammad sulaiman political science faculty of social and political sciences university of muhammadiyah jakarta,
594,Ambiguity Of Government Statement On Covid-19 Issue,this study analyses government statements related to the issue of the covid-19 pandemic. this study aims to find out what the government is saying not to misunderstand the people who hear it. the theory used in this study is the theory of semantic studies. the method used in this study is descriptive because this method is the proper method to describe the data collection results by researchers through observations in the mass media on the statements of research subjects. the result obtained is an explanation that explains the ambiguity of the government's ambiguous words in providing information related to the covid-19 cases.,"covid-19, semantic studies, turkey, march 7-10",,"sara dwi anjani faculty of language and literature, national university iskandarsyah siregar (corresponding author) head of center for nusantara sociocultural studies universitas nasional jakarta, indonesia regaranggi@presidency.com https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4529-6525",
595,The Impact Of Uneven Distribution Of Vaccines By The  World Health Organization (Who) In South Africa,"corona virus disease-19 or commonly referred to as covid-19 is a virus that first originated in the city of wuhan, china. the rate of spread of covid-19 is very short and also very deadly. in march 2020, the world health organization (who) declared covid-19 a global pandemic. since the importation of the first case in the south african region. the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid- 19) pandemic has spread to 46 countries of the 47 countries in the african region and caused unprecedented societal and economic disruptions. populations are being severely impacted with measures taken to curb the pandemic. therefore, causing hardships and socio-economic consequences. as of 3 may 2020, cumulatively, over 3.3 million confirmed cases and nearly 240,000 deaths have been reported globally from over 210 countries, areas, or territories. as of 25 february 2021, cumulatively, over 111.7 million laboratories confirmed cases and over 2.4 million deaths had been reported globally from over 190 countries, areas, or territories. in october to date, around 50 million covid-19 vaccine doses have arrived in south africa, which is almost double what was shipped in september. forty-two percent of countries in the african region have not yet completed district-level plans for their campaigns, while nearly 40% have not yet undertaken intra- action reviews which are key to refining and improving their vaccination campaigns.","covid-19 pandemic, social, economic, turkey",,"zulkarnain international relations department faculty of sosial and political sciences universitas nasional, jakarta suci nur ramadhani international relations department faculty of sosial and political sciences universitas nasional, jakarta email: zulkarnain@civitas.unas.ac.id",
596,Optimizing The Liver/Kidney Organ Donation Waiting List  In Antalya Using Maxsat And Graph Model,"organ transplantation has become an increasing need in the world and in our country. organ transplantation is completed by taking healthy and matched organs from living or cadaver donors and transplanting them to the recipient. different approaches are sought for solutions to the organ transplant waiting list and matching problem in the world and in turkey. the number of people waiting for organs is many times higher than the number of organ donors, and the difference is increasing every year. in this project, we research and learn all the details of the organ transplantation system in turkey, in particular the computer network where the organ waiting list and matching is processed, coordinated locally at akdeniz university prof. dr. tuncer karpuzoğlu organ transplantation center with the help of its coordinator and lecturer nilgün bilal. we work to identify problems and improve the system when applicable. we apply a new optimization method (maxsat method) to the organ waiting list and organ donation matching problem, on which second author worked with researcher felip manyà (uab-iiia/csic- spain) at the university in spain on her erasmus internship. alternatively, we also consider approaching the problem using other industrial engineering techniques such as stochastic modeling. we then compare the results in different techniques to improve the system.",maxsat,,"semail ülgen associate professor of industrial engineering faculty of engineering and natural sciences antalya bilim university antalya,turkey sulgen@antalya.edu.tr elifnaz yangın faculty of engineering and natural sciences antalya bilim university antalya,turkey elifnaz.yangin@std.antalya.edu.tr",
