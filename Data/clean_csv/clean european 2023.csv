1,Study Of How The Experience And Behavior Of Consumers  Are Affected By User Experience (Ux) Design In The Online,"with rapid technological development, human well-being was significantly enhanced with the invention of various advanced cyber-technologies. it is considered a fashion retailer that can grab this valuable opportunity and strengthen its competitive edge to cement its market position. e-commerce is becoming essential and causing influences currently. a significant proportion of fashion retailers are going to sell their products in the virtual platform which the online stores are generating increasingly contribution to the business and thus fashion retailers are more focusing on the user experience design of the online store. this research intends to analyze the relationship between the perception attributes of user experience design influence their perceived value and customer loyalty. in accordance with the hypotheses model that being developed with the foundation of technology acceptance model and other research models in investigating customer fulfilment, customers were required to complete a simulation of online fashion shopping along with evaluation of their shopping experience for the distinguishment for the crucial perception of user experience attributes that result to customer loyalty as well as the examination of the relationships among constructs. this research has verified the relationships of the perception attributes of user experience design and the formulation of customer loyalty.","user experience, fashion industry, customer loyalty","The research unveils the effect of the external perception attributes on perceived values and hence customer fulfilments is supported. There is significant effect from all the external perception values included in this study including color, usability, and aesthetics on both perceived usefulness as well as perceived ease of use. It also illustrates the mechanism in enriching web usability through the deployment of vision tracking experiment. There is strong prove in demonstrating customers from online fashion store are focusing on the above-mentioned external perception. Among the external perception values constructs, aesthetics has the most significant effect towards the perceived value of users. Indeed, aesthetics is a critical element among the three external perception attributes for customers in feeling comfort and foster their experience in online shopping. The effect of perceived values on customer fulfilments are also being supported. Particularly, the effect of perceived ease of use is a compelling anterior on customer fulfilments in which there is compelling indirect effect caused by satisfaction towards loyalty in enhancing the revisit and repurchase decision of customers. It is found that more and more online fashion retail store start to target on the website/ application design with the consideration of the three chief external attributes of color, usability, and aesthetics in enhancing the user experience of the browsing and shopping in enhancing customer loyalty due to the rapid development and the intense competitive environment of e-commence while the study demonstrate that the three external perception attributes have positive significant effect towards both perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use and hence affecting the customers loyalty. The outcome from the research could help the enterprise especially for fashion retailing industry in evaluating the deploying user experience design their website/ application interface in fulfilling customers’ needs and more importantly, attracting customers to ensure sustainable business growth. The future research should deploy a larger sampling size for the sake of enhancing the representative of the analysis and the fitness of the model in generating result with higher significance. Besides, this study is only limited to respondents in Hong Kong while the future research should also attempt the investigation from different market segments or geographical locations for multiple group analysis, for instance, customers between traditional fashion stores and fast fashion stores or customers from different countries/ regions, to make the study more favorable in comparing the difference of consumers from different markets and identifying the uniqueness of the customers each single market segment or location. The future study could also reinforce the constructs in exploring if there is any other positive significant relationship of user experience design attributes on customer fulfilment to let business in understanding more in defining their website interface with the achievement of diverse business objectives. 16","fashion retailing industry au mei yan, young tsz ting angela, yeh mau wong department of industrial and systems engineering faculty of engineering the hong kong polytechnic university, hung hom, hksar, china 19041809d@connect.polu.hk, 19063412d@connect.polyu.hk, 18063109d@connect.polyu.hk c.k.m. lee associate professor, department of industrial and systems engineering faculty of engineering the hong kong polytechnic university, hung hom, hksar, china laboratory for artificial intelligence in design, hong kong science park, new territories, hong kong sar, china ckm.lee@polyu.edu.hk","References

2,A Comparison Of 3D-Based Electronic Scanning And Manual  Anthropometric Measurement For Indonesian’S Women:,"a sustainable measurement of human body dimensions is of high interest. with the significant growth of fashion industry, a perfect fit of measurement is highly expected. though conventional anthropometry is still relevant and convenient, the preciseness and consistency of measurement is challenged. hence, a more robust and quicker anthropometric measurement has been proposed. it is through 3d-based anthropometric measurement taking into account what the user needs and expects. basically, numerous common-sense issues emerge within the large- scale utilize of electronic imaging frameworks, such as the choice of filter pose and robotized extraction of exact and reproducible estimations, without causing pointless inconvenience to the users. the essential focus of this work was in this manner to explore a strategy appropriate for large-scale surveying; to highlight particular issues of comparing 3d-based and manual anthropometric strategies; and to present this data within the real practices. this study involved 15 young females, their body dimensions were measured, both by the 3d-based and the traditional hand methods. there were 36 standard body dimensions compared. statistically, it can be concluded that most body dimensions were deemed to be insignificantly different. nevertheless, this study underpins a great communication bridge between clients and creators through the 3d virtual clothing process. the engineers and designers can effectively express their plan motivation by making a virtual clothing set so that they do not got to spend a parcel of vitality and cash to realize the physical sets. in terms of long-term orientation, the virtual 3d-based anthropometry supports the principles of sustainability especially the issue on environmentally friendly initiatives. without a doubt, it underpins the commitment of indonesian anthropometry updates.","indonesian, fashion",,"a case study of fashion design markus hartono professor of industrial engineering department of industrial engineering,faculty of engineering university of surabaya,surabaya, indonesia markus@staff.ubaya.ac.id dian prianka, christabel annora paramita parung, brian kurniawan jaya, viviany department of product design faculty of creative industries, university of surabaya dianprianka@staff.ubaya.ac.id, christabelannora@staff.ubaya.ac.id, briankurniawan@staff.ubaya.ac.id, viviany@staff.ubaya.ac.id",
3,Electromagnetic Performance Analysis Of Electrically  Excited And Interior Permanent Magnet Motor For,"this paper will compare and analyze an electrically excited synchronous motor (eesm) and interior permanent magnet (ipm) machines for an electric vehicle application based on volkwagen id.3 2020. the torque and power performances of eesm can be improved in wide range of speed with the same machine size and power inverter in compared with the ipm machine. efficiency maps of both machines are obtained and compared with iron losses calculated by finite element analyses. it shows that the ee machine can be a low-cost alternative to the ipm machine with slightly lower efficiency and maximum torque. due to its adjustable excitation, the ee machine is able to achieve a wider constant power speed range than the ipm machine. however, the efficiency of the ee machine is not better than the ipm machine in the high-speed region, since flux weakening control via armature windings is still necessary. this paper also presents a detailed design of three-phase interior permanent magnet (ipm) synchronous motors electrically excited synchronous motor (eesm) with minimum weight, and maximum power output for a wide constant-power range. the stator and rotor geometry of the two motors with several variables and constraints has been implemented to evaluate electromagnetic performances. the proposed motor design is based on both analytical models and special software to determine the magnetic sizes and geometry parameters of the stator and rotor. the experimental test and analytical results have been used to evaluate silicon steel material for designs.",,"This paper has analyzed and compared torque, power and efficiency of a 3-phase 48-slot and 8-pole EESM and IPM motors for EV applications.

4,Economic Optimization Of The Inspection Period For  Sensors With Hidden Failures:,"failure of critical industrial equipment can have high stake negative impacts for industrial operations. systematic preventive maintenance is a widely used technique to assess the condition of such equipment, including its potential failure. however, carrying out regular shutdowns on a critical equipment for inspections incur costs and potential production losses during the downtime period. consequently, detection devices, such as sensors, are often used for monitoring the condition of critical equipment. these sensors can issue early warnings upon the occurrence of functional failures in the protected equipment or even anticipate potential failures. promptly action can then be carried out to repair or replace the failed critical equipment to mitigate its consequences. failure detection sensors are not immune to their own failures though. sometimes, the functional failure of the sensor is immediately detected, other times it remains hidden and goes unnoticed until it manifests through more serious consequences, such as a breakdown in the protected equipment, which can lead to long recovery times and significant repair costs. therefore, it is essential to periodically inspect the proper functioning of condition monitoring sensors to uncover any hidden failures, namely through in-place or laboratory testing. this study presents an economic optimization approach, using a discrete-event monte carlo simulation method implemented in a microsoft excel application, to determine the optimal inspection periodicity for sensors subject to hidden failures. each simulation run computes the equivalent uniform periodic cost for any inspection period for the sensor, considering the following inputs: inspection cost and time, probability distributions for failure times of the equipment and sensor, repair costs and times, and the reactivation cost and time following a system failure. from these inputs, the optimal inspection period is determined by running multiple simulations for varying regular inspection periods and selecting as optimal the one that minimizes the expected equivalent uniform periodic cost of the system. the approach was developed specifically for the major portuguese electric utilities company, replacing previously used empirical formulas that did not factor in economic costs. the application of the methodology is supported by a user-friendly interface implemented in microsoft excel and visual basic for applications and illustrated through a case study. the decision support system facilitates the selection of the economically optimal inspection period for the sensor based on its expected equivalent uniform periodic cost. furthermore, it provides additional descriptive statistics on the expected performance of the system, including availability and reliability metrics. the optimization-simulation approach presented in this article provides significant advantages over common analytical methods, which often rely on unrealistic simplifying assumptions, particularly for modeling complex maintenance systems. overall, it proves to be a valuable contribution to the maintenance literature for making informed decisions regarding the definition of regular inspection periods for sensors with hidden failures while monitoring the condition of critical industrial equipment.","sensors, inspection period, hidden failures",,"a monte carlo simulation approach ricardo j. g. mateus, rui assis, joão a. rodrigues, and p. carmona marques rcm2+ research centre for asset management and systems engineering, lusófona university, portugal p5768@ulusofona.pt, rassis46@gmail.com, p5942@ulusofona.pt, p4803@ulusofona.pt",

To maximize the performance of the IPM, the average torque, torque ripple, DC link voltage and Radial forces were set as the multi- objective function, and efficiency and torque ripple were set as constraints.

The result of optimization shows the efficiency of the entire approach. The analytical model and the optimization program are both implemented using MATLAB which makes it easier to use. To validate if the suggested motor truly meets the requirements and boundaries, results are verified using FEM which is also controlled via MATLAB and will be initiated automatically after optimization. The technique of SSR is an efficient way to improve the performance of the motor as a technique of skewing slot. A hybrid genetic algorithm (HGA), which combined a genetic algorithm (GA) with the Taguchi method, is proposed to optimize the rotor structure of an IPMSM for an electric vehicle application, to maximize the torque and efficiency, and minimize the torque ripple and iron losses.","pham minh tu, bui minh dinh, nguyen nga viet, and dang quoc vuong school of electrical and electronics engineering hanoi university of science and technology (hust) vietnam tu.phamminh@hust.edu.vn dinh.buiminh@hust.edu.vn, viet.nguyennga@hust.edu.vn and vuong.dangquoc@hust.edu.vn",

8,Linear Programming Applied To The Vehicle Routing  Problem With Simultaneous Delivery And Pickup:,"this work presents two mixed-integer linear programming models to solve a pickup and delivery problem from a portuguese company. the objective is to determine the minimum travel time for the pickup and delivery of manufacturing tools of the manufacturing tool repair support service, of this company. the contribution of this work involves the presentation of two three-index mathematical models. those models reflect the integration of the simultaneous delivery and pickup problem, with the capacitated vehicle routing problem with time windows. the two mixed-integer linear model formulations are presented and used to solve the problem using several real-world test instances. it is also compared their performance using some benchmark instances, proving its feasibility and comparing its behavior.",,"The main idea started with the need to improve the MTR support service’s efficiency of a Portuguese company. This service is one of the most time-consuming activities because it consists of delivering and collecting the manufacturing tools, from the MTR workshop to the production lines and vice-versa. To focus on improving this distribution process, it was proposed to develop and implement a support system that informs workers when to do a P&D route, according to the tools needed for production and the tools available for collection. The data related to what tools were available for collection in the production lines and what tools were available for delivery in the MTR service is known. Every time that a P&D route must be done, we are facing a VRPSDPTW. Since the number of production lines, vehicles and tools is not very high, it was decided to solve this problem using a linear programming model. However, the need arose to test more than one approach, to validate its efficiency in terms of computational time and solutions. Hence the proposal presented in this paper to make a comparative study of the performance of two models: Vehicle-Flow model and the Commodity-flow model. With the two models, most of the real-world instances tested were solved optimality in a reduced computational time and good upper bounds could be generated for the remaining instances. The models were also tested, and its performance compared with the well-known benchmark tests for Li and Lim (2001). Even with these more complex and larger instances, the conclusions drawn for the real instances were the same. In conclusion, after the tests performed, the commodity-flow model has a better performance regarding computational times and GAP values, than the vehicle- flow model, being proven its efficiency. 62","a comparative study bárbara romeira govcopp / degeit university of aveiro, portugal barbararomeira@ua.pt ana moura assistant professor govcopp / degeit university of aveiro, portugal ana.moura@ua.ot","References

10,Where Is Greenness Made In Product Life Cycle? A Multi  Perspective Literature Review And Framework For,"a plethora of studies have been conducted to address sustainable product fulfillment. to facilitate the understanding, authors have published their review papers focusing on different issues, e.g., green product design approaches, decision support systems implemented in sustainable manufacturing, cross relationships between product attributes and consumer decision-making. although these review papers potentially advance research on the respective issues or topics, an overview of the product life cycle stages in sustainable product fulfillment, which were the most frequently examined, is not seen. this study is to review the relevant literature, in attempting to identify these life cycle stages and further explore the relevant issues, such as the methodologies used, the sustainability dimensions (i.e., economic, environmental, and social) considered, and the industries involved. based on a rigorous search and selection process, 114 papers were retained for analysis. as shown in the results, green consumption was the focus in 54 papers, thus being the most examined stage. it is unexpected to see that the end-of-life treatment stage was discussed in only 5 articles. regarding methodologies, quantitative research was the most frequently conducted, contributing to 65 papers. while a variety of industries was involved in the 114 papers, the automotive industry was the study background in 11 papers. although achieving sustainability from all the three dimensions is very important, most of papers (79 out of 114) considered one or a combination of two dimensions. with the results and analysis, we further shed on the prospects, obstacles, and future directions in facilitating sustainable product fulfillment from all the three dimensions of sustainability.",lille-paris,,"future research linda l. zhang full professor of operations management ieseg school of management, univ. lille, cnrs, umr 9221 - lem - lille economie management, f-59000 lille, france. l.zhang@ieseg.fr shuang ma assistant professor school of economics and management, university of science & technology beijing, beijing 100083, china. mashuang@tju.edu.cn",
11,An Optimization Model For A Retail Distribution Supply  Chain Network Design – A Case Study,"delivering value to the consumer, allocating orders, and cost-optimization are all functions that the retail distribution supply chain performs with growing importance. as a result, businesses must embrace a comprehensive perspective of the entire network. these requirements have driven the modeling of supply chain network design from a retail standpoint. the study considers a multi-echelon network with several manufacturers, distributors, retailers, and customers while developing a mathematical model to minimize total costs. in addition, it uses secondary data from a small and medium-sized enterprise in vietnam, called the sme to improve its network. the findings are used for strategic and operational decisions, such as determining the number of facilities needed, optimizing total distribution costs, as well as resulting in a need for a strategic alliance. to our knowledge, this empirical study is one of the efforts to provide the door for more research on the adoption of a retail distribution supply chain network design.",multi-echelon,", Limitations, and Future Research The study examines the SME operations in Vietnam by using the MILP method and CPLEX tool. The results are useful for the SME to consider strategic and operational decisions in the distribution network design, such as figuring out how many facilities are required and how to optimize total distribution costs. This SCND optimization model not only helps the SME at that time but also be applied in the future if the company focuses more on long-term strategies to develop effective strategic alliances to cope with customer demand changes. With the MILP method and CPLEX OPL solver, users will be exposed to a simple, easy-to-customized method and programming language. On the other hand, the MILP method will be more accessible for those with more work experience, they can model based on very practical constraints, and the giving outcomes are also as good as other methods. This paper not only confirms the effectiveness of the mathematical model in designing supply chain networks for the SME retail systems but also desires to introduce new methods and tools to small and medium-sized companies in Vietnam. Limitations and Future Research Direction Generally, many retail distribution companies in Vietnam, especially small and medium-sized companies, build a supply chain network based on experience when started their business. This caused uncontrollable implicit costs, time, and distance leading to order lasting, cost increases, etc. The SME is one such company, a mathematical model, and a technical tool to improve the business are needed. However, the model still has limitations, for example, the author should investigate more into business processes to modify and add more realistic and effective constraints, and other variables such as labor costs, as well as relevant data. Mathematically, if there are more constraints, the algorithm will be easier, and the program will produce faster, more optimal results. However, there is always a contradiction in the adoption of mathematical models for practical problems, therefore, there should be coordination between model builders and companies. In summary, future research is directed by limitations, in which more data analysis and consideration of both internal and external factors would improve the study.

12,Port 4.0: Integrating Advanced Technologies To Transform  Port Operations,"“port 4.0” is the concept of integrating advanced technologies such as the internet of things (iot), big data, artificial intelligence (ai) and blockchain to enhance the overall efficiency of the port operations. “port 4.0” has the potential to transform port operations, making them more secure, and environmentally sustainable. as “port 4.0” is still at a nascent stage in the maritime industry, the paper aims to provide a comprehensive review and analysis of key technologies related to “port 4.0”, their potential benefits and challenges and future trends and development. the findings indicates that the implementation of “port 4.0” technologies can improve efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance competitiveness and while increasing supply chain transparency. however, challenges such as high implementation costs, system integration, cyber risks, and a lack of digital talent need to be addressed. collaboration among port stakeholders was found to be critical in driving innovation and competitiveness. policy responses and recommendations for future research were also presented.","port 4.0, smart port, sustainability, maritime industry, supply chain 77",,"abdelghani benayoune head of research and graduate studies - imco professor in the department of logistics management national university of science and technology, imco muscat, oman a.benayone@imco.edu.om",
13,Improving The Effectiveness Of Enterprise Resource  Planning (Erp) System Implementation Using A Hybrid,"recent research on critical failure factors (cffs) in erp projects shows that the discovery and implementation of organizational processes are among the top seven main groups of cffs. in this paper, a hybrid process mining and fmea framework is presented to quantify the risk factors associated with process non-conformance. this approach is designed to increase the effectiveness of implementing erp solutions in organizations, based on the identification and assessment of business process risks using the fmea methodology. this study contributes by enhancing the bpm life cycle using process mining algorithms. to validate the proposed approach, a case study is conducted on the warehousing and logistics management process in one of the largest grain trading companies in iran. the results of the research show that the use of the proposed approach can reduce the rpn of this process from 336 to 16 thus increasing the effectiveness of the erp solution deployed.","bpm, process mining, fmea, erp systems, risk management 78","and Future Research After redesigning the warehousing and logistics management process using the proposed BPMPM framework and automating this process by traffic software, the results of the process mining and software logs show that the implementation of the compliance process is 76%. Also, after implementing the recommendations of the eighth step to calculate the effectiveness of the measures taken to reduce the risk of the warehouse and logistics management process, one more time the risk assessment of this process was done by the FMEA technique. As can be seen in Figure 13, performing corrective action for automation and error proofing of the process led to the improvement of probability number, detection factor, and RPN, and the risk of the process was classified in the low- risk area. Considering the compliance of 76% and the new RPN number which is 16, the effectiveness of the redesign of the warehouse and logistics management process with the proposed BPMPM approach is evident, which led to the elimination of the possibility of leaving bulk goods without registering documents in the ERP system. This case greatly satisfied the stakeholders of the ERP system. As mentioned in the first part of this article, in ERP projects, problems related to the identification and implementation of organizational processes are one of the seven main groups of critical failure factors. The findings of the case study clearly show that the use of the proposed hybrid approach (BPMPM) based on risk management, knowledge of business process management, and the use of process mining solutions was able to reduce this risk and increase the effectiveness of the implemented ERP solution. In this research, due to the time-consuming nature of the case study, one process was studied, it is recommended to use the proposed method for other processes, such as the order to cash, purchase to pay, account payable, and accounts receivable. Also, the proposed approach was used after the implementation of the ERP solution, it is suggested that researchers in this field also check the performance of the proposed approach before the implementation of ERP. 95","process mining and fmea framework *behrouz mirkhanzadeh m.sc. of industrial engineering islamic azad university, south tehran branch tehran, iran mrbhrz@gmail.com (corresponding author) erfan hassannayebi assistant professor industrial and system engineering department of industrial engineering sharif university of technology tehran, iran hassannayebi@sharif.edu moojan kamalzadeh ph.d. of telecommunications engineering erik jonsson school of engineering and computer science the university of texas at dallas texas, usa moojan.kamalzadeh@gmail.com bahador zandi m.sc. of industrial engineering islamic azad university, west tehran branch tehran, iran b.zandi@zarholding.com","References

17,Distribution Function Similarity Of Commercial Drivers And  Their Willingness To Take Examinations And Training,"in the process of training and examining professional drivers who serve as commercial trucks and coaches’ drivers, studying the willingness of taking training courses is a crucial concern for transport authorities for developing training programs on transportation. to this purpose, an adapted version of the statistical method of kolmogorov-smirnov, three sample, has been utilized to investigate the similarity of distribution functions for three types of drivers who receive permission with taking training courses and examinations, taking examinations without training courses, and receiving permissions without examination and training courses. data, for those received permissions across the west- asian country of iran, has been collected for a year through the system used for issuing drivers’ permissions for commercial transportation followed by categorizing into thirty-one provinces and analysis. the results revealed that their distribution functions are different for three types of drivers over the provinces. therefore, transport authorities should design driver’s exams and training courses different province to province.","commercial drivers, drivers’ training","Since in the process of managing training courses for commercial drivers, it is necessary to investigate more on the distribution function of willingness to take examination and training courses by drivers who are willing to serve as commercial drivers. The overall concept behind the research work is to check the similarity between the drivers who received commercial certificates without taking exams, training courses and exams, and eventually exams without training courses. Data for all types of drivers have been collected in each province and the well-known goodness of fit test of Kolmogorov-Smirnov in its three sample format has been utilized to check if their distribution functions are the same or different. The results revealed that their distribution functions are different. It means that transport authorities should differently design exams and training across the courses where they should be designed different province to province. Further research in this field is recommended to focus more on specific measures such as the rate of acceptance for drivers who were participating in examinations and taking training courses and without training courses. Transport authorities are also recommended to design more applicable training courses to encourage drivers 0.00 0.10 0.20 0.30 0.40 0.50 0.60 0.70 0.80 0.90 1.00 Alborz Ardabil Bushehr Chehar-Mahal-O-Bakhtiari East-Azerbaijan Fars Gilan Golestan Hamedan Hormozgan Ilam Isfahan Kerman Kermanshah Khouzestan Kohgiluye-Va-Buyer-Ahmad Kordestan Lorestan Markazi Mazandaran North-Khorasan Qazvin Qom Razavi-Khorasan Semnan Sistan-O-Baluchestan South-Khorasan Tehran West-Azerbaijan Yazd Zanjan Unexamined Trained Untrained 135","courses (case study: iran) abbas mahmoudabadi director of master program in industrial engineering, department of industrial engineering mehrastan university, guilan, iran mahmoudabadi@mehrastan.ac.ir fatemeh pourhossein ghazimahalleh graduated student, department of information & commerce technology mehrastan university, guilan, iran fatemeh.pourhossein@yahoo.com","References

18,Robust Supply Chain Design For Highly-Customized  Manufacturing,"customers in today’s evolving markets are seeking options that best suit their specific needs; consequently, the demand for highly-customized and personalized products has been growing steadily. in order to facilitate customized manufacturing, the structure of the underlying supply chain (sc) needs to be enhanced in terms of flexibility and resilience. in this study, we consider an sc comprising a main manufacturer that produces custom-designed modular- structured products, featured with different design complexity levels. the products have a bill-of-material (bom) that can be altered in terms of the design of a subset of sub-assemblies and components. it is further assumed that the company collaborates with a group of manufacturers and part suppliers (upstream sc entities), differentiated in terms of capacity, technological capabilities, and cost, along with a group of logistics carriers (downstream entities) distinguished in the sense of their cost and lead time. in other words, in addition to involving customers in the product design, the company also provides different modes of product delivery (e.g., fast, regular, and slow) offered by different logistics carriers. we also incorporate the uncertainty involved in the manufacturing of subassemblies and parts featured with complex designs. more specifically, to reflect the amount of effort required to manufacture complex designs, the production and procurement costs of (highly or moderately complex) items are considered as piece-wise linear functions of their order quantity. furthermore, the manufacturing capability of upstream entities for producing complex items are assumed uncertain, and modeled as scenarios. more precisely, under some scenarios, the producers/suppliers will not be capable of fulfilling the order of highly/moderately complex items within the promised production lead time due to technological limitations. to obtain the optimal configuration of the above-mentioned sc, we first develop a deterministic mixed-integer programming (mip) model that seeks the optimal choice of sub-assembly producers, part suppliers, and logistics carriers in addition to the optimal quantity of procurement, production, and transportation at different echelons. the objective is to minimize the total manufacturing, transportation, and lost-sale cost. afterward, in order to incorporate the uncertain technological capabilities of producers/suppliers, the above mip model is reformulated as a two-stage stochastic program (2-sp). in this model, three types of corrective (recourse) actions are considered in order to compensate for the incapability of producers/suppliers in the manufacturing of complex products. these actions correspond to resorting to backup suppliers/producers; purchasing sub-assemblies and components from the open market; and lost-sale, in case none of the first two actions are feasible. obviously, the cost of all recourse actions mentioned above is substantially higher than the cost of the initial assignment of producers/suppliers that must be set prior to receive full insight in terms of suppliers’ capabilities. we explore a sample average approximation (saa) scheme to solve the 2-stage stochastic mip model under different scenario sets. in-depth computational experiments are conducted to validate the proposed models and solution algorithm while showcasing the value of incorporating uncertainty into the sc design problem.",supply chain design,,"masoumeh kazemi zanjani associate professor hoora katoozian phd candidate department of mechanical, industrial & aerospace engineering concordia university montreal, canada masoumeh.kazemizanjani@concordia.ca",

However, when it comes to its role in developing sustainable products, there is a lack of knowledge and certainty, which calls for innovative research. As such, this study is aimed at investigating the potential contribution of BDA to the development of sustainable products. To this end, a Fuzzy TOPSIS approach is employed to analyze the subject based on a set of respective criteria. The analyses and findings demonstrated that the criterion ‘product end-of-life management efficiency’ has the highest closeness coefficient of 0.79, revealing that BDA could make a considerable contribution to developing product end-of-life management efficiency, among other product sustainability criteria identified. The findings would significantly contribute to the body of BDA knowledge as this study stands as the primary empirical investigation exploring the contribution of BDA in the development of sustainable products on the basis of product sustainability criterion. The significance of this research lies in its ability to bridge the gap between data-driven insights and sustainable practices, ultimately paving the way for a more sustainable future. The enriched insights provided by this study may open up new possibilities and avenues for further exploration and innovation in the field of BDA for sustainable products. Further studies are recommended to extensively investigate and delve deeper into the findings, and to also explore a broader range of criteria that have the potential to influence the development of sustainable products within the realm of BDA. The vastness and complexity of this research domain call for continuous exploration and scholarly inquiry to unlock new insights and push the boundaries of knowledge in this field. It is imperative to expand our understanding and uncover hidden dimensions to fully grasp the transformative potential of BDA in fostering sustainable products development, which is of vital importance to sustainable development.

26,Cable Routing Optimization For Floating Offshore  Wind Farms Integrated With Offshore Oil And Gas,"floating offshore wind farms (fowfs) are considered one of the fastest-growing types of renewable energy technologies and are superior to bottom-fixed offshore wind farms due to their low requirement of seabed conditions. the cost of dynamic submarine cables constitutes a significant proportion of the overall capital cost for fowfs, making optimization of the cable connection layout a critical aspect of modern wind farm design. to this end, we propose a mixed-integer quadratic programming (miqp) model that takes into account the impact of the wake effect in various wind scenarios. our proposed objective is to minimize both the cost of cable investment and power losses. in contrast to traditional fowfs that require expensive offshore substations and high-voltage transmission cables, the fowfs presented in this paper are designed to directly supply energy to independent power systems located on nearby offshore oil and gas platforms (oogps). we employ the benders decomposition algorithm to solve our proposed miqp model, with two valid inequalities introduced to accelerate convergence speed during the decomposition process. these valid inequalities are formulated based on technical/physical analysis and a greedy-based heuristic initialization. we demonstrate the validity and fast convergence speed of our approach through several fowf case studies.","power losses, wake effect, wind scenarios",,"platforms considering wind scenarios rongsen jina, xiaoqiang caia,* athe chinese university of hong kong (shenzhen), pr china .",

28,Using Lean Practices To Overcome Challenges With  Improving Warehouse Operations,"this improvement project was conducted in a warehouse that provides repair services and storage for the equipment, supplies/consumables, and repair parts needed to perform technical cleaning and hygiene services for clients such as in schools, hospitals, airports, etc. while initially organizing materials one section/area at a time using 5s (sort, set- in-order, shine, standardize, and sustain), challenges encountered included space limitations with the existing layout, co-location of repair and storage operations, inability to temporarily shut-down operations to organize, and resistance to disposing of unneeded items. to resolve the space/layout issues, management invested in renovating the warehouse. while cleaning prior to renovations, many sorting activities took place. post-renovations, to organize and streamline operations (set-in-order and shine), a new space utilization plan was developed and implemented that organized items across the warehouse into separate storage zones, designated space only for performing repairs, and stored all repair parts together in the same zone. to standardize, visual controls were implemented, including floor markings and storage location labels, as well as a shadow peg board and a toolbox with foam cut-outs in the repair work area. in addition, standard operating procedures were developed. to sustain, a bi-weekly audit procedure was developed, and a communication board was installed where, among other things, audit feedback would be posted. finally, inventory reorder points were established, and a kanban system was implemented for material replenishment.","action research, lean, 5s",,"diogo gomes master’s student in management of services and technology instituto universitário de lisboa (iscte-iul) lisbon, portugal daltg@iscte-iul.pt jamison v. kovach pmi houston endowed professor in project management university of houston houston, tx, usa jvkovach@uh.edu teresa cardoso-grilo assistant professor at iscte business school instituto universitário de lisboa (iscte-iul), business research unit (bru-iul) lisbon, portugal teresa.sofia.grilo@iscte-iul.pt",
29,A Waste To 3D Printing: The Development Of   Additive Symbiotic Networks,"industry 4.0 technologies, such as additive manufacturing (am) and blockchain technology, may drive the implementation of a new generation of circular economy strategies. however, the role of these new technologies in designing and implementing circular economy ecosystems is not a trivial issue. in this sense, this phd research work intended to foster knowledge for the development of industrial symbiosis networks within the am industry - the so-called additive symbiotic networks. a systematic literature review was performed and revealed current circular economy relationships within the am industry and highlighted the potential of this industry to create and develop additive symbiotic networks, in plastic wastes from other industries may be used as material inputs for am processes. a definition of the concept additive symbiotic networks is proposed in this work. nevertheless, given the digital nature of am and considering challenges related to trust or the implementation of transactions within the additive symbiotic networks, there is a need to find tools that enable the development of those networks. blockchain technology may be an enabler of such symbiotic networks, and its adoption within these settings may have implications in the supply chain of additive symbiotic networks. using an abductive research approach, in this work two case studies were conducted concerning two additive symbiotic networks, that comprised companies using am processes to valorize plastic waste streams. case study a highlighted that there is potential within the context of additive symbiotic networks to explore the adoption of blockchain technology and identified a set of requirements that support the technology adoption in that specific network context. from these conclusions, case study b was developed to understand the implications of adopting such disruptive technology as the blockchain in the supply chain structure of an additive symbiotic network. results showed that with the adoption of blockchain there is a reduction in the number of intermediary stakeholders involved in the network and there is an adaptation of the value flows within the network. by offering a tool that helps to deal with the challenges associated with the additive symbiotic networks, exploring its adoption and some of its implications in the supply chain of those networks, this phd work encourages the development of the additive symbiotic networks, contributing to the efficient use of natural resources, promoting the collaboration between industries, and reducing waste streams to achieve more sustainable production.",,,"inês a. ferreira phd student department of mechanical & industrial engineering nova school of science and technology caparica, portugal id.ferreira@campus.fct.unl.pt helena carvalho associate professor industrial and management engineering unidemi – department of mechanical and industrial engineering, nova school of science and technology 2829-519 caparica, portugal hmlc@fct.unl.pt",
30,Developing A Tool For Pbo Design And Analysis: An  Integration Between Enterprise Architecture And Project,"project-based organizations (pbos) are loosely coupled, with significant decentralization of power that makes complex the alignment of projects, governance system and functional units. moreover, projects are constantly changing in a pbo. therefore, a solution for pbo design and analysis is needed to provide cohesion of a single design in constant remapping. designing a pbo involves aligning strategy, structure, processes, organizational behaviour and people, as well as the project management (pm) practices and artefacts. however, the available tools to achieve this goal do not have an integrated overview between the organization and pm. also, they are mainly in the form of a text guideline that makes its application difficult. in order to fill this gap, this research seeks to develop an integration between project management and enterprise architecture domains. the above is performed through a conceptual integration of the archimate language for modelling the organizational architecture and the pmbok pms' body of knowledge, providing an alternative tool for covering the pbo design, analysis and modelling concerns. this integrated model has been developed through the semantic web that enhances computer querying and reasoning for its analysis. an evaluation has been performed through automatic ontology debugger tools.","project management, ontologies, semantic web 231",,"management domains edison atencio and mauro mancini department of management, economics and industrial engineering politecnico di milano via lambruschini 4b, bovisa, 20156 milan, italy edisonpatricio.atencio@polimi.it, mauro.mancini@polimi.it edison atencio and guillermo bustos department of industrial engineering pontificia universidad católica de valparaíso av. brasil 2241, 2340000, valparaíso, chile edison.atencio@pucv.cl, guillermo.bustos@pucv.cl edison atencio department of civil engineering pontificia universidad católica de valparaíso av. brasil 2147, 2340000, valparaíso, chile edison.atencio@pucv.cl",
31,Sustainability Of Digital Transformation  Jiri Tupa,"digital transformation is a concept that is currently being discussed and emphasized in many policies, industrial and corporate strategies. in the scientific literature, digital transformation is often discussed as one of the pillars of a sustainable economy. on the other hand, the question is how to ensure that the digital transformation process itself is sustainable in the long term. that is, not only the transformation process itself but also the application of digital technologies in companies afterwards. this paper aims to explore the sustainability of digital transformation by analyzing its environmental, economic, and social impact. through a literature review, this paper identifies several key factors that contribute to the sustainability of digital transformation, including the term energy transformation and education and digital skills, security, and business continuity. based on the conducted research a model of sustainable digital transformation was proposed. the model presents the key elements for the sustainability of digital transformation. the paper concludes by discussing the implications of these findings for organizations, and individuals.","industry 4.0, sustainability, digital skills","In this paper, research was conducted to explore the sustainability of digital transformation. As a result, a model for sustainable digital transformation has been proposed, encompassing key elements essential for achieving long-term sustainability in this process. The model identifies four fundamental pillars and emphasizes the importance of a common background. The identified pillars serve as the foundation for creating a sustainable system, not only during the digital transformation process but also for the resultant system itself. However, it is worth noting that additional pillars can be included in the model to further enhance sustainability. Examples of such pillars may include economic health, social and societal factors, technological maturity, and more. By adopting the proposed model, organizations can ensure that their digital transformation initiatives are not only successful in the short term but also contribute to long-term sustainability. The model provides a holistic approach, addressing various dimensions of sustainability and encouraging organizations to consider the broader impact of their digital transformation efforts. Organizations must recognize that sustainable digital transformation is not solely about technological advancements but also encompasses economic, social, and environmental aspects. By considering these dimensions and integrating them into their strategies and practices, organizations can create a sustainable digital ecosystem that benefits all stakeholders. In conclusion, the proposed model of sustainable digital transformation offers valuable insights and guidance for organizations embarking on digital transformation journeys. By embracing the identified pillars and considering additional relevant factors, organizations can navigate the complexities of digital transformation while ensuring long- term sustainability and maximizing the benefits derived from their efforts.

32,Operational Risks Evaluation In Cement Industry Using  Bayesian Network With Uncertainty,"in order to ensure a successful cement manufacturing process and avoid negative consequences, it is crucial to identify and analyze potential risks. the aim of this research paper is to use two models, the fault tree analysis and bayesian networks, to identify and mitigate risks associated with the process. while both models are useful, the bayesian network model is the dominant one used in the research, and it has been combined with the fault tree model to address its limitations. together, the two models work to produce the best possible outcome in terms of risk identification and mitigation. the paper intends to offer a solution to evaluate risk profiles in the cement industry using bayesian models. the goal is to improve the methodologies of identifying risk events and categories by examining them under uncertainty. the results obtained from this research will help managers make better decisions by considering the significance of confidence intervals within the uncertainty region. this approach will ensure that the process is well-planned and that risks are identified and mitigated to avoid negative consequences, such as worker injuries and harm to third-party personnel.","operational risk, bayesian network, cement industry","The cement manufacturing process involves multiple stages, each associated with specific risks that can collectively reduce a company's revenue. The present paper proposes a methodology using Bayesian networks (BN) to efficiently identify and mitigate these risks. The methodology is important and applicable to project managers in charge of production risk management. Organizations can use this methodology to approach risks and determine the best way to mitigate them while considering production status under uncertainty. One limitation of the paper is the ambiguity of the collected data, making it challenging to determine whether the company was being truthful or overrating risks. BNs are useful tools in monitoring risks in the industrial sector. Companies should regularly identify risks and create a BN risk profile to aid the risk management department in creating new strategies to curb risks and minimize their effects. The BN profile can then be updated as new information becomes available, making it a dynamic platform for risk management. The risks examined in this paper provide a general solution for the cement manufacturing process that can be applied at the industry level, rather than the company level. However, the success of the model is dependent on the honesty and accuracy of the parameters used in risk identification. Risk managers should regularly provide updated information to ensure the model remains relevant. The paper primarily focuses on the impact of the production process on a company's revenue, but other factors, such as the mode of manufacture, can also affect productivity. Thus, in application, all these factors should be factored in as they are mutually exclusive. Overall, this methodology can help companies in the cement industry, and other industries, identify and mitigate risks to minimize revenue loss and improve production efficiency.","khaled ali abuhasel full professor in mechanical engineering department-industrial engineering program, college of engineering university of bisha, bisha 61922, saudi arabia. kabuhasel@ub.edu.sa; corresponding author mohammed alquraish associate professor in mechanical engineering department-industrial engineering program, college of engineering university of bisha, bisha 61922, saudi arabia. malqraish@ub.edu.sa",
33,"Lean Manufacturing Waste Prediction And Reduction Model  B.B.S Makhanya, J. H.C. Pretorius And H. Nel","it seems impossible to increase efficiencies in a manufacturing setting without first pinpointing the causes of waste. the goals of this research were to use the quality management data collected to determine which aspects were significantly correlated with manufacturing waste, and then to use machine learning techniques to create a model that could predict manufacturing waste. the case study research was used for this analysis. the data range from 2019 to 2021 and includes 215924 rows and 13 features. five predictors and eight terminal nodes were used to create the final cart model, which achieved an r2 of 0.389 and an accuracy of 97.31%. inventory management, customer wait times, meetings, and unscheduled breaks all contributed to 80% of the time that was wasted. high levels of inventory management problems occurred in months 6-11. the waiting times caused by customers averaged 2.97 hours per month between months 7 and 11. meetings that started at 8:00 lasted, on average, 7.5 hours. the majority of the time spent waiting is caused by customer complaints that come in between the hours of midnight and 5 a.m. at 7:00, with a 4.3-hour lag, most reports of inventory problems were made. only quantitative secondary data were used in this analysis. qualitative approaches should be prioritized for future studies. models for predicting waste in the future could benefit from using random forests and treenet.","cart analysis, six sigma","To improve manufacturing efficiency, it is necessary to comprehend the sources of waste. This study first analyzed quality management data to establish relationships between data characteristics and manufacturing waste. Secondly, it used tools for machine learning to develop a model that can predict manufacturing waste. A case study was used in this study. We utilized 215924 rows and 13 columns or features spanning 2019 to 2021. The robustness of the model was evaluated using RMSE, MAPE, and R-squared. The optimal model consisted of 30 terminal nodes and an R- squared value of 0.437. This exploratory research required a simplified tree with adequate R-square. The final CART model had five predictors, eight terminal nodes, an R-squared value of 0.389, and an accuracy of 97.31%. There was a strong relationship between occupation, day of the week, month and the amount of waste generated. Eighty percent of waste was attributable to inventory management, waiting on customer, meetings, and contractual breaks. Months 6, 10, and 11 exhibited significant inventory management issues. In months 7 through 11, the average waiting on customer was 2.97 hours. The average duration of 8:00 a.m. meetings was 7.5 hours. The majority of waiting-on customer reports arrived between midnight and 5 a.m. Most inventory issues were reported at 7:00, with a delay of 4.3 hours. The company should improve inventory management, customer relations, and reduce meetings. Future research should employ qualitative methods to better comprehend waste factors, as this study only utilized quantitative secondary data. In addition, there is a strong belief that Random Forest and TreeNet can improve waste prediction in future research.","postgraduate school of engineering management faculty of engineering and built environment university of johannesburg johannesburg, gauteng, south africa bsm3174@yahoo.com, jhcpretorius@uj.ac.za, hnel@tennelli.com",
34,Quality 4.0 Trends And Application:   A Systematic Literature Review,"this study investigated the trends in quality 4.0 and what they mean for various industries. scopus was the main database used in the systematic literature review. only papers written in english that directly addressed the study's research objectives and were published between 2017 and 2023 were included in the analysis. the number of papers on quality 4.0 has increased exponentially over the years. the majority of papers came from the tqm journal, followed by the international journal of quality research and sustainability switzerland. in our investigation into what quality 4.0 means for industries, we used a sample of 14 papers. we used qualitative data analysis known as thematic coding, and through inductive thematic coding, we were able to identify 99 codes that were associated with quality 4.0. the study found that quality 4.0 is a broad term encompassing nearly all aspects of quality management, including big data, digital quality management, connectivity, cybernetics, managing disruptions, simulation, and more. according to the study, quality 4.0 is unlikely to change the traditional quality management strategy; rather, it will make things smarter, faster, and more intelligent. the study's findings were consistent with previous research and had both reliability and validity.","big data, quality management, quality 4.0",". The findings of this study were similar to those of previous studies. For example, the studies of Broday (2022), Maganga and Taifa (2023) found exponential growth in the publications related to quality 4.0 since 2016, which is similar to what we found. We found that most of the papers from the TQM Journal reflect the same finding (Broday, 2022). We are confident of the study's validity and reliability as its findings are consistent with those of other researchers who conducted similar research. 6. Conclusion The purpose of this study was to investigate the trends in quality 4.0, as well as to determine what exactly that term means for various industries. For this study, a systematic literature review was performed, and the Scopus database served as the primary research tool. The period from 2017 to 2023 is covered by the papers that were included in this study, and the predominant language used in those papers was English. We made use of 14 papers in our investigation into what it means for industries to have quality 4.0. In the study, qualitative data analysis, known as thematic coding, was utilized. Through inductive thematic coding, we were able to identify 99 codes that were connected to quality 4.0. According to the published research, quality 4.0 is unlikely to change the conventional strategy for quality management; rather, it will make things smarter, quicker and more intelligent. The findings of the study indicate that quality 4.0 is a broad term that touches nearly all aspects of quality management. Some of the ideas that are beginning to predominate discussion under the quality 4.0 umbrella include big data, electronic quality management, digital quality management, connectivity, cybernetics, data management, managing disruptions, simulation, and more. This study's findings were consistent with previous research, and we concluded that the study had both reliability and validity. In reviewing this study, it is worth noting that the study relied on a literature review, which means that some of the findings may need to be tested in future studies through interviews or other forms of empirical research. Because this study benefited from work published all over the world, we believe that generalizing the findings of this study will not be one of the study's limitations.","b.b.s makhanya, j.h.c pretorius and h. nel postgraduate school of engineering management faculty of engineering and built environment university of johannesburg johannesburg, gauteng, south africa bsm3174@yahoo.com , jhcpretorius@uj.ac.za, hannelien@uj.ac.za",
35,Cost Reduction Of Water Supply Systems Through  Optimization Methodologies:,"the global water supply accounts for 7% of worldwide energy consumption. with the increasing energy tariffs, there is a growing need to reduce the energy consumption of water supply systems (wss). among the three primary areas for optimization in wss, pump operation is the most critical one, representing 70% of the energy consumed in wss. despite several mathematical formulations and approaches for optimizing pump operation in wss, there is a lack of comparative studies between them. moreover, since each wss system has unique physical characteristics, the performance and solutions generated by each formulation may vary. therefore, this study aims to conduct a comparative analysis of three wss optimization approaches, of which one was never implemented. these approaches are applied to two case studies with specific physical characteristics.",cost reduction,"are the same as in case study 1. 5. Conclusions and Future Work Optimization applications in water supply systems are several, but it is critical to emphasize the optimization of pump operations, as it is an area where energy consumption is significant. With increasing water consumption, energy consumption is also increasing. Therefore, optimizing pumping station energy consumption is essential for economic and environmental sustainability. Reducing energy consumption in pump operations makes it possible to lower operational costs, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and increase the overall efficiency of WSS. As such, optimization of pump operation is crucial to achieving a sustainable and efficient water supply system. This study compared three optimization approaches - binary formulation with a genetic algorithm, continuous formulation with SLSQP, and duty-cycles formulation with SLSQP. The results indicate that for water supply systems where the pump operation point (and, by consequence, the pumped flow) is affected by its physical characteristics, i.e. water tank level and consumption points, the duty-cycles formulation with SLSQP (DC-SLSQP) is more effective at obtaining economical solutions due to its increased operational freedom. However, it is essential to pay careful attention to the initial solution provided to the optimization model as the final solution can be quite sensitive to it. On Figure 10.

37,Budget Allocation For Humanitarian Logistics:   A Data-Driven Approach,"in recent years, humanitarian organizations (hos) have been coping with increasing humanitarian needs while faced with budget cuts. it is thus crucial for the ho to efficiently utilize the limited budget in providing humanitarian aids. in this paper, we focus on a ho relief program with a fixed scarce amount of budget to purchase and distribute multitype relief items to beneficiaries with heterogeneous demands. given the budget, the ho first makes item purchase from external suppliers and then distributes each type of the items equally to the beneficiaries. equal distribution strategy is a normal practice currently employed in humanitarian operations. however, the strategy fails to tackle demand heterogeneities that inherently exist among beneficiaries, causing significant mismatch between supply and demand. on the other hand, in this study, we point out that the true demand is hardly known by the ho and thus equal distribution can be first taken for fairness concern. to further deal with the mismatch, we borrow the idea from exchange economy and facilitate the ho to set up an item barter channel for beneficiaries. to cope with the demand uncertainty, we employ data-driven analytics taking advantage of the summary statistics about ukraine refugees during russo-ukrainian war and model the demand using moment-based ambiguity set. consequently, a two-stage distributionally robust optimization (dro) framework is developed where in the first stage the ho purchases and distributes equally among beneficiaries with a fraction of the fixed budget and in the second stage the ho promotes relief item exchange among refugees with the remaining budget with the goal of minimizing the worse- case expected demand shortage cost. the key decision to make for the ho is to budget allocation for each stage. the dro model is reformulated into a mixed-integer linear program and solved via cutting plane algorithm efficiently. numerical experiments show that using a small part of the budget to allow item exchange among refugees could further reduce demand shortage compared to the state-of-the-art approaches.",exchange economy,,"hongzhang yang, lei xu georgia tech shenzhen institute, tianjin university shenzhen, china xulei@gtsi.edu.cn adam ng tsan sheng national university of singapore, singapore isentsa@nus.edu.sg xiaoqiang cai the chinese university of hong kong, shenzhen shenzhen, china xqcai@cuhk.edu.cn",
38,"Cobot-Human Assembly Line Balancing Problem Tevhide Altekin,","in this paper, we consider a manual assembly line consisting of multiple stations, each accommodating a worker. collaborative robots (cobots) are assigned to stations in order to assist the workers by performing part of the workload. the role of the cobot is to replace the worker in some of the tasks, such as positioning parts, pick& place, or for example, holding an item while the worker performs some task on it. the assembly operation is captured by a precedence diagram, consisting of the tasks needed to be done to complete the product, with precedence relations among them. each task can be classified as follows: (1) worker task; (2) cobot task; (3) either task (can be done by either the cobot or the worker); (4) concurrent task (needs both the worker and the cobot). the objective is to allocate the workload among the workers and cobots, given the line configuration, to minimize the cycle time (or maximize the throughput rate). the following collaboration types are defined: (1) independent collaboration: workers and cobots work on separate tasks. each task is solely done by either the human or the cobot; (2) concurrent collaboration: a worker and a cobot perform together the same task (e.g., the cobot holds the part while the human makes some operation); (3) sequential collaboration: two tasks, one done by the worker (cobot) and the other by the cobot (worker) have to be done continuously one after the other. given the configuration of workers and cobots, the problem is to assign tasks to workers and cobots while minimizing the cycle time. since the problem is solved for a given configuration, we define dominance rules among configurations and show that only non-dominated configurations should be considered. we prove some properties of such configurations. next, a milp formulation is developed to solve moderate problem sizes. to improve the performance of the formulation, we develop some bounds on the cycle time. then we demonstrate the performance of this formulation to solve problems of up to 20 tasks to optimality and up to 50 tasks with a relatively small optimality gap. for solving large-scale problems, we develop an adaptive large neighborhood search (alns) heuristic, which repeatedly improves an initial solution by destroying and repairing the solution. the former is done by removing tasks from the solution, while the latter is done by solving a modified milp formulation. the performance of the heuristic is examined in wide experimentation. proceedings of the 6th european conference on industrial engineering and operations management lisbon, portugal, july 18-20, 2023 © ieom society international 330",,,"yossi bukchinyossi bukchin , tel-aviv university, `",

42,Optimizing The Implementation Of Sustainable Green  Construction Strategies Post The Covid-19,"green construction is a sustainable movement that aims to create environmentally friendly construction starting from the planning, implementation, to the use of construction materials that are environmentally friendly and efficient in the use of resources. this study aims to examine the implementation of green construction strategies in construction projects in jakarta, as well as analyze the optimization of sustainable green construction strategies post covid-19 pandemic. this research is qualitative research using a case study approach. primary data was obtained through in- depth interviews and fgd. construction companies in jakarta are expected to have concrete actions to optimize green construction strategies, one of which is strategic action by using green technology in construction. the strategy of green construction companies is to take innovative steps in creating environmentally friendly construction by using efficient resources to create environmentally friendly green construction. the next strategy is sustainability action, in which green construction companies try to create environmental sustainability so that the role of innovators in the field of green construction is needed, especially for construction companies that apply green technology. the main strategies are financial benefits for stakeholders, public policies in facilitating green construction, government support and knowledge development in green construction. comprehensive and well-planned sustainable green construction management is a long-term investment for the construction industry. to achieve the sustainability of the green construction industry, companies that use green technology play an important role. supported by using the isphi method, they can become leading innovators in implementing post-covid-19 sustainable green construction strategies in jakarta.","green, construction, sustainability, strategy","The construction industry needs to re-engineer construction management by adjusting and transforming itself into green construction to complete work effectively, efficiently and at the right time to achieve sustainable optimal results. Green construction here means implementing a construction process that is efficient in terms of all resources used and can be responsible for the surrounding environment to be able to ensure the sustainability of the green ecosystem that is created through the implemented green construction. Especially in the context of green construction sustainability implies a cycle of operation, site design, maintenance, repair, and demolition with minimal environmental damage. The process does require close collaboration between green construction engineers, architects, governments, and clients across all green construction projects. The green construction concept aims to ensure cost-effective building construction methods and should be able to reduce the overall effect on negative environmental impacts, as well as always prioritize human health, through its focus is on implementing the efficient use of green energy and resources, conservation of water and energy savings, occupational health, minimizing pollution and existing construction waste. It is hoped that the positive impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on policies and changes that have occurred in the construction sector will be one of the drivers of Indonesia's post-pandemic economic growth, especially for construction companies in the Jakarta area. Therefore, it is important to develop an integrated strategy to develop an overall end-to-end green construction strategy to enable sustainable goals to be achieved. The construction industry needs to re-engineer construction management by adjusting and transforming itself in the industrial era 4.0 where technological support is necessary to complete project strategies effectively, efficiently, and achieve sustainable optimal results. A well-organized green construction organization will produce less waste, so it is very important for the organization to develop a detailed strategy on optimizing green construction strategies to increase the productivity and efficiency of the company, where the company must also be environmentally responsible by sourcing concrete actions to provide solutions to future green construction problems. Comprehensive and well-planned sustainable green construction management is a long-term investment for the construction industry. The proposed green construction development using the ISPHI method is expected to be the right strategic guideline to strengthen sustainable principles in proper handling and optimize the implementation of post-Covid-19 sustainable green construction strategies in Jakarta.",pandemic in jakarta yenita faculty of engineering universitas tarumanagara letjen s. parman no. 1 west jakarta yenita@fe.untar.ac.id,

Although it would be possible to develop such an improvement project with other softwares, it would not be easy to develop this project within the desirable timeframe without the help and inclusion of some data science and data mining tools. The inclusion of such helped not only to extract several information from unstructured source files, but also to transform and organize it in a structured manner. Furthermore, this was done considering large amounts of data to process (or at least large enough for traditional improvement projects). However, it was also shown that a considerable amount of the information extracted from the logs was of no-good use. It was due to the experience and knowledge of the process experts that “the dots were connected” and value insights were taken from the available data, converting these insights into improvement actions that contributed to increasing the production output.

46,Turbine Generator Power Plant Reliability For   Solar System Improvements,"the reliability of power supply by south african coal-fired power plants has become the central focus of many areas of governments’ strategic planning. the reason for this is its poor maintenance, unplanned outages, increased generator trips and lack of adequate skills. the impact of the above shortcomings is increased load shedding, insufficient electricity in the country, high cable theft, low production in manufacturing industries and insufficient photovoltaic energy produced in grid-tie system configurations. thus, this work tends to demonstrate the need for improving the existing coal power plants to increase the amount of solar energy in the national grid. the historical data was collected from plant failures, generator asset management, maintenance strategies and unplanned capability loss factors. this data was analyzed through qualitative and quantitative research methods. the results obtained from the proposed methodology show that inadequate training of employees, skills shortages, unavailability of quality spares, and lack of maintenance are some of the major contributing factors to plant breakdowns and failures. furthermore, research has revealed that a preventative maintenance strategy is the most recommended strategy to improve generator plant reliability instead of a corrective maintenance strategy that is currently used and found to be ineffective and inappropriate.",,"There is a high demand for reliable electrical supply from the continuously growing population in the world. Many business sectors have declared losses in profits and revenues due to the unavailability of reliable power supply. Several strategies and procedures have been developed by the power utilities in support of maintenance departments and projects to ensure the improvement of plant maintenance and performance. The power utilities are underperforming despite the investment of large amounts of money in maintenance and outage budgets. From the data collected, results obtained and analyzed in this study it is shown that power utilities have been and are still experiencing a continued high rate of plant breakdowns and failures over the past years. The plant failures comprise boiler, turbine, and generator failures which result in the unavailability and unreliability of electricity supply. Various plant breakdowns and maintenance are due to poor maintenance, delayed maintenance, and outages. In addition, some of the contributing factors to poor plant performance are lack of adequate skills, training, aging infrastructure, and non-availability of quality spares. Asset management strategy and maintenance strategy, particularly corrective maintenance strategy applied to coal power plants are futile, ineffective, and inappropriate strategies that could lead to continued load shedding. It is recommended to improve maintenance and minimize delays on scheduled outages by conducting regular inspections and preventative maintenance. The aging infrastructure that can no longer be maintained must be refurbished and new equipment with improved technology installed to monitor plant performance. Skills gap analysis must be performed to assess the skills shortages of personnel as well as the level of competency to assist maintenance departments to allocate budgets for the training and development of employees.

48,Competencies For Quality Management:   A Systematic Literature Review And Perspectives,"quality management is crucial to the companies so that they can maintain and enhance their competitive advantage towards the market. in this context, the quality managers play a fundamental role and is important that they have the necessary competences to do their job. however, the competences for the quality management are not a subject broadly discussed in the academy, despite its presence in the professional literature. in order to address this issue, the present study aims to perform a mapping of the academic literature regarding the competences for quality management through a bibliometric analysis complemented by a content analysis. as results, the main authors, journals, and themes related to this area were identified, as well as the main dimensions of competence and the main research gaps to guide future studies.","quality management, competence, literature review","The objective of this article was to map the area of competencies for quality management through a bibliometric analysis combined with a content analysis. Our findings suggests that, in general, the literature on competencies for quality management has been developing over the years, although there are still many gaps that need to be filled. The field presents a very pulverized structure, without a solid theoretical basis that permeates the studies that integrate it. Despite this, the field is presenting developments when interacting with other areas of knowledge such as Industry 4.0 and information technology. In a theoretical way, the study contributes with the indication of the main authors, journals, and themes for the field, in addition to pointing out the main dimensions of competencies treated and research gaps, in order to guide future researchers who wish to contribute to the theme. From a practical point of view, this article helps to structure the existing knowledge about the competencies for quality management, in addition to guiding professionals in the area on the main dimensions of competencies, necessary for a quality manager. Despite the authors' efforts to obtain the most complete sample possible, this study has limitations directly related to the databases and methodological choices regarding the search strings, filters and databases used. In addition, the sample selection process had the analysis of only two researchers, which may instill a bias to the data due to the non- existence of several evaluators and eventual choices by consensus. As opportunities for future research, in addition to those mentioned in section 4, there is a need to identify the main competencies addressed in each of the dimensions presented by the researchers to seek and understand eventual correlations between the dimensions of competence presented. In addition, it is necessary a theoretical study about the definitions of competence used by the various researchers, to obtain a more general definition for each of them, aiming to direct the field of study to a common theoretical basis.","for the future artur henrique de morais brito and fernando tobal berssaneti department of production engineering universidade de são paulo av. prof. almeida prado, 128, travessa 2, cidade universitária, são paulo, sp, brazil artur.brito@usp.br, fernando.berssaneti@usp.br",
49,Aumann-Shapley Pricing For Airline Baggage Service  Prabhupad Bharadwaj And R K Amit,"the airline industry derives a substantial portion of its ancillary revenue from baggage fees. however, it has not utilized a controlled and structured approach to baggage pricing. airlines have been using different pricing strategies, such as flat rate pricing or weight-based pricing, without considering the actual cost allocation for providing those services, resulting in overcharging or undercharging scenarios. this study discusses the application of non-atomic game theory in pricing strategy for a joint cost setting in passenger baggage transportation. cost allocation-based pricing can provide a “fair” approach to pricing these services and will be widely accepted by the passengers. aumann- shapley price is an application of non-atomic game theory that involves finding fair prices for divisible goods where each infinitesimally divisible good is considered a separate player in the game. we demonstrate that this pricing approach for baggage services will be helpful in generating prices based on the weight and volume consumption of a passenger, which are the players in the continuum for this game. the concept of “chargeable-capacity” is adopted in our research to postulate axioms that will generate prices that are cost-covering, positive, and aggregation invariant. although the prices are calculated only on a portion of the total capacity, they satisfy the budget-balance requirement by charging a penalty to the capacity consumptions beyond the free limit. pricing functions can be considered linear functionals and satisfy the absolute continuity property to represent an integrable function. this idea is used to prove that the pricing mechanism proposed by us satisfies all the pricing axioms. to differentiate between the prices of pre-booked and on-site baggage, we extend the axioms further to provide an advance-purchase discount and ensure the pre-booked excess baggage is charged lower as compared to the on-spot bookings. various cost functions are examined to support our claims and establish the robustness of the pricing mechanism. we also compare the weighted value prices with the ramsey-boeitux rule to establish the relationship between the weights and the price elasticity of demand for pre-booked and on-spot baggage services. it is justifiable to assume that pre- booked baggage is more price elastic than spot-booked baggage, as pre-booked baggage is usually purchased well in advance, giving customers more time to compare prices and make informed decisions. this gives us the idea that the weight for pre-booked baggage is less than the spot bookings. any differentiable joint-cost function satisfies the rules stated in our research, and findings imply that prices will rely on consumption patterns and the proportion of chargeable capacity selected by the airline. the pricing mechanism encompasses all aspects of baggage price and permits airlines to offer variable weight and volume allowances. the proposed method is extendable to comparable cases such as railway and road freight services.",,,"decision engineering & pricing (deep) lab, department of management studies (doms), indian institute of technology madras, chennai, india pbharadwaj@smail.iitm.ac.in, rkamit@iitm.ac.in",
50,Traveling Salesman Problem: The Efficiency Of Simulated  Annealing Applied To A Real Case Study,"this paper deals with a traveling salesman problem that is performed daily by a portuguese bakery company. the bakery delivers bread to multiple customers using only one vehicle and driver, leading to high costs and time consumption. the objective is to minimize total travel distance and optimize the distribution process to reduce costs. in this case, we have a typical traveling salesman problem and in order to solve this problem, several solutions were first computed and compared, and then, these were used as initial solutions to a simulated annealing (sa) approach. the performance of the sa was tested for the real problem, with the actual company data and, an analysis of the sa behavior when started with different solutions was performed. the results obtained allowed the company to reduce its current route by more than 23%.",,"This paper presents an efficient approach to solve a Travelling Salesman Problem by applying the Simulated Annealing metaheuristic. The main objective sought was to reduce the route currently taken by the bread distributor of a Portuguese bakery and, for this, several initial solutions were computed to be considered as an initial solution for the SA. To determine these initial solutions, several methods were used, including Clarke and Wright's heuristic and the Nearest Neighbor heuristic. The results obtained allowed us to conclude that, in fact, by applying Simulated Annealing it is possible to improve the current route made by the distributor. It was also possible to conclude that the best solution is achieved when the SA uses the NN-EI initial solution. Thus, it is suggested that this route should be implemented since it’s shorter and reduces distribution time and associated costs. The proposed goal was achieved: the total distance to be covered for the distribution of bread to 195 customers is reduced in more or less 20 km, which corresponds to more than 23% of the initial route’s length. 451","eva rodrigues, cíntia câmara, maria almeida department of economics, management, industrial engineering and tourism university of aveiro, portugal egr@ua.pt , cintiacamara@ua.pt, beatrizamador@ua.pt pedro nunes tema / dem university of aveiro, portugal pnunes@ua.pt ana moura govcopp / degeit university of aveiro, portugal ana.moura@ua.pt","References

51,Two-Dimensional Cutting Problem:  Application Of Heuristics To Troubleshooting,"this paper aims to study a cutting problem inherent to the modelling process of a textile company and find a solution that minimizes fabric waste. thus, several heuristics were adopted, whose results allowed inferring about the company’s current condition, i.e., whether the current solution adopted is effective in minimizing fabric waste. the heuristics have been tested, analyzed, and compared using a pre-existing database. following this hypothetico- deductive method, the initial heuristic and its improvements were subsequently applied to the real problem. regarding the solutions, the 1st heuristic presented the worst solution, as expected, and the subsequent heuristics (2nd-5th) presented continuous improvements of approximately 5% compared to their predecessors. based on the results, it was found that the created heuristics did not generate better solutions than the current one adopted by the company (h = 4.04m), i.e., its solution is robust and effective, considering the company's objective. however, the successive improvements made to the heuristics allowed generating of good solutions comparable to the ones given by the specialized software.","regular, irregular, heuristics","All five heuristics were programmed in Python, taking also into account an exact method solution, coded in CPLEX, and a specialized software, to prove the modified heuristics performance. Along the successive heuristics, it is notable the increasable level of complexity involved in the problem resolution. However, the most complex heuristic may not always correspond to the best solution, since the LGFR heuristic only presented a better solution than RFFDHR heuristic on 3/50 cases, presenting a worst solution on 27/50. Furthermore, it is also notable that in all cases where the optimal solution of number of rolls was guaranteed to be reached, the optimal solution value was low (<10), which can possibly be explained by the accumulated errors. By applying the previously presented heuristics to the company’s problem, satisfactory results were obtained, highlighting the best solution, given by the IILGFR heuristic, that needs 4,29 m for the roll height, which is very close to the actual company solution (4,04 m) that is generated through a highly specialized software. For future research, the authors suggest the use of a two-phase heuristic approach, such as in the first phase one of the presented heuristics is used to generate an initial solution and in a second phase using an improvement heuristic, that make modifications to the initial solution by switching pieces positioning, to obtain progressively better solutions.","in the textile sector antónio teixeira, diogo figueiredo and marco gonçalves master student in industrial engineering and management aveiro university aveiro, portugal antoniorteixeira@ua.pt, diogofigueiredo@ua.pt, marcofgoncalves@ua.pt ana moura professor in industrial engineering and management degeit/govcopp aveiro, portugal ana.moura@ua.pt",

53,"Modelling, Simulation And Experimental Study Of A Hybrid  Photovoltaic-Thermal Collector (Pvt)","solar energy is among the renewable energies with the highest growth potential in the world. from this primary energy source, one can obtain electrical or thermal energy through different conversion methods, either using the photovoltaic panel or the thermal collector, respectively. the photovoltaic-thermal (pvt) collector is a hybrid solar device that combines, in the same equipment, an electrical energy production module (photovoltaic module) with a thermal energy production module (thermal module). however, the pvt does not have the same maturity as the photovoltaic panels or the thermal collectors that are independently available on the market. as an emerging equipment, it still needs to be further studied and developed, namely in its modelling, among other aspects. this work focuses on a numerical investigation of the pvt technology, with the goal of evaluating how computational mathematical models predict the operating scenarios of an experimentally studied pvt unit. as such, acquired experimental data was analised against simulations of energy and mass balances. the model was validated for the same conditions of the experimental tests, therefore determining the degree of agreement with the data acquired experimentally. a very good general agreement is observed between the simulated and experimental results.","energy balance, photovoltaic model, solar energy","The general objective of this work was the validation of a mathematical model developed for the global study of a type of PVT collector, namely a PVT without additional glass, in real scale and with a liquid thermal fluid. Inherent to the objective, a contribution to a better design of these types of hybrid collectors is pursued. The numerical model, with thermal energy balances and solar cell equivalent circuit, was implemented in a MATLAB-Simulink environment. The proposed model was validated with an excellent degree of agreement between data acquired experimentally, in real conditions, and simulated data, verifying that the highest value of the difference between these data was 2.3%, at some moments of the day. Thus, it can be ensured that the model is reliable in its application to the study of this type of PVT analysed, and it can even be verified that it can be adapted to other types of PVT.

54,Outpatient Chemotherapy Process With Home-Based And  Mobile Services: A Decision Framework And Operation,"delivering chemotherapy at home or in mobile chemotherapy units has become increasingly popular due to its convenience and patient-centered approach. however, the high demand, complexity, and stochasticity of the outpatient chemotherapy process (ocp) can lead to inefficiencies in implementing these services. to address this gap in the literature, this study presents a decision support framework and operational model for optimizing the ocp with the inclusion of home-based and mobile chemotherapy services. data-driven research and relevant literature have been integrated to formulate the decision-making process in the proposed decision support framework. a mathematical model is developed to determine the patient and nurse assignments to outpatient department, home, or mobile chemotherapy services, as well as appointment scheduling. a discrete event simulation model is employed to solve the proposed model and determine the performance measures. the optimization experiment included various demand scenarios, and the results showed the value of implementing home-based and mobile chemotherapy services on patient waiting time and staff overtime under all the considered scenarios compared to a baseline. finally, implementation and modeling strategies have been proposed for scholars and decision-makers to build on this work and benefit from its findings.",optimization,"This study has contributed to the OM literature by conducting a comprehensive review of the related work on HChemo and MCU and identifying gaps in the literature. The study has developed a comprehensive decision support framework that integrates the HChemo, MCU, and outpatient department processes for optimizing the OCP. Moreover, an operational decision model that combines the HChemo, MCU, and outpatient department processes has been modeled to determine the patient scheduling and nurse assignment decisions. Real data from a large OCC was collected and used to develop and test the model under different demand scenarios. The results confirmed the advantages of implementing HChemo and MCU and proposed strategies for proper implementation and modeling.

58,A Data-Driven Approach For Pids Tuning In Energyintensive Industry: Application To Evaporator In,"proportional-integral-derivative (pid) controllers are widely used in industrial processes, and finding the most appropriate pid parameters plays an important role in optimizing plant operation. however, tuning a large number of pids is a labor-intensive task that often leaves many control engineers uncertain about how to proceed. to tackle this problem, this article provides an automated approach to select and recommend the appropriate set of numerical values for p, i, and d. our approach is an open-loop pid autotuner which is based on a data-driven model that represents the physical process and an ensemble of optimization algorithms. to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we tuned 531",,"This paper proposes a systematic PID tuning framework based on a FOPDT model for an industrial open-loop process, and its effectiveness of controlling the concentration of black liquor is shown by a case study of an evaporator system in Kraft pulp manufacturing. For this energy-intensive industrial application, optimization algorithms including CG, Newton-CG, trust-ncg, trust-krylov, COBYLA, L-BFGS-B, Powell, TNC, BOBYQA, PSO, and GA can achieve the function of PID tuning. After taking into account the metrics of 𝑅𝑅2, convergence time, and closed-loop simulation, it has been established that the Powell and BOBYQA optimization methods are the most appropriate choices for optimizing the four PIDs. For future research, it would be valuable to conduct a thorough examination of FOPDT as a model identification technique in order to assess its benefits and drawbacks in relation to other methods. Furthermore, our proposed approach will be validated by testing it on real-world applications. Moreover, there is potential for exploring alternative directions, such as utilizing advanced machine-learning and reinforcement-learning techniques to tune PID directly in a closed-loop configuration. 538","kraft pulp mill haitian zhang phd candidate in the department of chemical engineering university of waterloo, waterloo, canada haitian.zhang@uwaterloo.ca mohamed el koujok research scientist at canmetenergy energy efficiency and technology sector, natural resources canada varennes, canada mohamed.elkoujok@nrcan-rncan.gc.ca qinqin zhu assistant professor in the department of chemical engineering university of waterloo waterloo, canada qinqin.zhu@uwaterloo.ca hakim ghezzaz process engineer at canmetenergy energy efficiency and technology sector, natural resources canada varennes, canada hakim.ghezzaz@nrcan-rncan.gc.ca mouloud amazouz senior project manager at canmet energy energy efficiency and technology sector, natural resources canada varennes, canada mouloud.amazouz@nrcan-rncan.gc.ca ali elkamel full professor in the department of chemical engineering university of waterloo,waterloo, canada aelkamel@uwaterloo.ca","References

60,Ergonomic Risk Assessment Of Lpg Hose Handling Process  At A Gantry Operation: A Basis For Administrative And,"liquified petroleum gas (lpg) is one of the longest-running fuel businesses in the philippines, serving the needs of small and medium-sized enterprises. the import facility operates 24/7, ensuring the completion of loading and discharging operations. the gantry operators are involved in lifting the heavy lpg hoses and exerting forcefully with their hands to refill the flammable truck. it is necessary to assess them to determine their level of suffering, given the hours and days they consumed to accommodate the product's demands. given these conditions, the paper aims to assess the current design of the gantry station to determine the factors that affect the discomfort of the operators. in this study, the current working conditions were assessed through interviews and observations with a total of ten (10) operators using the workplace ergonomic risk assessment, wisha caution/hazard zone checklist, and cornell musculoskeletal discomfort questionnaires. based on the results, both wera and wisha showed that risk was present, requiring further investigation due to the awkward postures. in cmdq results, the body part of the wrist was the highest area of complaint (44.75%), which is the most important to address the pain suffered by the operators. the researchers determined that there is no significant relationship between ergonomics assessment and physical discomfort using spearman rank correlations. furthermore, a proposed action plan was created using the hierarchy of administrative (suggestions for administrative programs) and engineering controls of developed equipment that would hold the repositioned heavy hose to limit force exertion.","cmdq, ergonomic risk, wera","Based on the summary of the WISHA Caution/Hazard Zone Checklist, 5 hazards mean if one or more hazard boxes are checked, a work-related musculoskeletal disorder hazard exists, and further action is recommended. As a result of WERA, there is a serious ergonomic risk in the workplace that requires further investigation and requires change with a total mean of 35.5. These findings have significant implications for workplace occupational health and safety, and steps should be taken to protect workers from pain and injuries related to their jobs. After the ergonomics assessment, the Cornell Musculoskeletal Discomfort Questionnaire was used to test its relationship with the previous assessment.

61,Reducing Mobile Phone Repair Cycle Time At A  Telecommunications Company,"developing process efficiencies resulting in shorter cycle times (i.e., the elapsed time between starting and completing a job) is one mechanism organizations often use to achieve a competitive advantage, higher profits, and/or better customer satisfaction. this research examines how a telecommunications company is working to reduce their repair process cycle time through an action research project in which researchers work side-by-side with company employees to develop and implement practical solutions. given the specific goal to reduce the cycle time of their existing repair processes across multiple locations, the company selected the lean six sigma methodology to guide their process improvement efforts. this began with mapping the processes, analyzing measurement systems, and collecting cycle time data. in addition to establishing a baseline measurement, these data will be analyzed to identify the sub-process steps, product types, repairers, etc. with the longest cycle times. these aspects will then be analyzed further to determine the causes of waste in the process. next, ideas will be developed regarding how to reduce/eliminate the causes of waste, these ideas will be evaluated using group decision-making tools, and the most appropriate solutions will be implemented. finally, a control plan will be established to facilitate behavior change of employees working in the process and monitor the improved process performance to ensure long-term sustainment of the reduced cycle time.","after-sales service, action research, cycle time",,"using lean six sigma catarina carvalho master’s student in management of services and technology iscte – instituto universitário de lisboa lisbon, portugal cccoe@iscte-iul.pt jamison v. kovach pmi houston endowed professor in project management university of houston houston, tx, usa jvkovach@uh.edu sofia kalakou business research unit (bru-iscte) iscte – instituto universitário de lisboa lisbon, portugal sofia.kalakou@iscte-iul.pt",
62,Lean For Sustainability: A Focus On The Preventive  Maintenance Process For Construction Equipment,"lean thinking is an essential concept that has emerged in most organizations and industries. this is due to its proven outcomes in improving the process by removing waste and delivering value to the customer. applying lean has also benefited the process by making it more sustainable by reducing the waste that negatively affects the three pillars of sustainability (environment, economy, and society). although lean has been established as a concept to improve the manufacturing process, it has extended to cover the maintenance process with reliance on established maintenance principles like total productive maintenance (tpm) and existing lean methods. this paper aims to study and analyze a preventive maintenance (pm) process of a construction company in qatar and implement lean maintenance methods with tpm to improve the process by minimizing lean waste with a focus on improving process sustainability. the methodology has been assessed through a real case study from a construction project of the company selected. the project equipment preventive maintenance process was analyzed, sustainability indicators were identified, and lean maintenance tools were implemented. the results have revealed that the process has been improved, and sustainability wastes have been minimized.","lean thinking, sustainability, lean maintenance, 5s","and recommendations This paper presented a lean-based methodology for enhancing the sustainability performance of a construction company's PM process in Qatar. As can be seen from Table 3, the process and lead times have improved by 80% and 89%, respectively. These are the indications of lean waste reduction which are desirable for the company as it will improve the performance of the PM process, increase the availability, and enhance the utilization of the resources. Regarding sustainability improvement, the results show an improvement of 90% in CO2e emissions compared to the current process. This is one of the measurable indicators which was accessible for this study. Suppose data on the national level, such as road utilization by construction companies' service trucks, is available. In that case, another indicator for sustainability could be used to measure the effect of construction equipment services utilization on roads which has a social and economic impact on the national level. This is due to its effect in increasing the congestion on roads, which affects the mobilization of citizens, concentrates noise pollution, and leads to reduced road capacity, all of which impact quality of life. Eventually, there will be a requirement to upgrade the roads and infrastructure due to more rapid rates of asphalt deterioration, hence influencing government spending. However, other indirect sustainability enhancements in the process are more difficult to quantify, such as fuel consumption reduction on a national level due to the implementation of lean thinking in construction company maintenance processes. In conclusion, this paper aims to deliver a possible solution for enhancing the sustainability of a PM process for construction equipment, which might not show its effect significantly in one company or one project, but creates awareness for decisions makers at a national level to consider adopting this technique in policy planning in the construction sector. 5.","mohammed masoud, abdulla al-mohannadi, and batti al-naemi mechanical and industrial engineering department college of engineering, qatar university doha, qatar mm1100481@qu.edu.qa, aa2110258@qu.edu.qa, ba2111008@qu.edu.qa",
63,Machine Learning-Based Forecasting Of Ambulance  Arrivals: Insights For Shift-Based,"understanding the specific timings of ambulance arrivals during different shifts presents unique opportunities for emergency department (ed) throughput optimization. this research aims to determine whether there are significant differences in ambulance arrivals across various periods (i.e., morning, afternoon, evening, and night) and to use machine learning to forecast daily emergency medical service (ems) arrivals. we performed a cohort study of patients presenting to an urban, academic ed between january 1, 2021 and april 18, 2022. data comprised daily patient arrivals, demographic information, mode of arrival (either by walk-in or ambulance), chief complaints, and ed disposition, focusing exclusively on patients who arrived via ambulance. a light gradient boosting machine (lgbm) model was developed to forecast daily ems arrivals based on different periods. the findings indicate distinct ambulance arrival patterns, with higher patient influx during the night shift. the lgbm model achieved moderate to high accuracy, particularly during the evening and night periods, with mean absolute percentage errors of approximately 21% and 19%, respectively. this study provides insights into ambulance arrival patterns, emphasizing the need for specialized care across different periods. these findings can inform the development of decision support systems that leverage advanced analytics to optimize resource allocation, enhance preparedness, and improve patient outcomes in eds and health systems.","ambulance, machine learning, forecasting","This research successfully achieves its objectives of identifying significant differences in ambulance arrivals across various periods and employing machine learning to forecast daily EMS arrivals. Our data, collected from an urban, academic ED, revealed distinct patterns in ambulance arrivals, with the most significant patient influx occurring during the night shift. Furthermore, there were significant differences in arrival times between morning and afternoon, morning and evening, morning and night, afternoon and night, and evening and night periods. Interestingly, no substantial difference was found between the afternoon and evening periods. The developed LGBM model displayed moderate to high accuracy, especially during the evening and night periods, with 21% and 19% MAPE, respectively. The unique contribution of this study lies in its comprehensive examination of ambulance arrival patterns and the application of machine learning to forecast daily EMS arrivals. It underscores the necessity for specialized care across different periods and the potential benefits of predictive models in ED management. In conclusion, understanding and predicting ambulance arrival patterns can have significant implications for the efficient management of EDs, which may ultimately lead to more effective patient care and improved health outcomes.

Interestingly, despite the Covid-19 global health crisis, most companies that implemented Industry 4.0 were able to maintain their business moderately or without major impact. In fact, 78.5% of companies reported a moderate or no impact on their business. This is largely due to the stability of their activities (60% of companies) or a partial shutdown (37.2%). Companies have successfully adapted to the situation by using digital tools such as remote team communication tools, telecommuting tools for meetings, remote support tools for telecommuting, and document management tools with anytime access. For example, 55.5% of companies used remote team communication tools and 78.5% used telecommuting tools for meetings. These tools allowed employees to work remotely and securely and to continue their activity despite the restrictions imposed by the health crisis.

79,System Improvement On Late Delivery Service Of   Online Delivery Business,"in this paper, the researcher observed the delivery performance of a local ""delivery service business."" upon observation, it shows that considerable numbers of late delivery are the central problem, and the study addresses it by determining the leading root cause that highly contributes to the problem. the researchers manually recorded raw data used in this study upon observing the company's daily operation in the set time frame. also, the administration was interviewed and customer feedback was gathered. in analyzing the ultimate root cause of late delivery, different root cause analysis tools were used in this study: a fishbone diagram for the general root causes, a five whys analysis, and a scatterplot diagram for determining the primary root cause. results from the rca tools concluded that delays caused by the store are the root cause that highly contributes to the late delivery of the business. for the recommendation, the study designed a new delivery process to minimize the number of delays caused by stores and to increase the success rate in meeting the customers' expected arrival time. this study used a mixture of quantitative and qualitative design.","system improvement, delivery time, late deliveries, delay","Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, global travel restrictions and stay-at-home orders have been implemented in different countries, causing the most severe disruption to the global economy. People need to innovate and create ways to sell their products to make their business alive, and, in some countries, restaurants can operate under takeaway/delivery sales (Gossling et al.,2020). Faced with this dire situation, characterized restaurants were forced to increase, diversify, or adapt new sales channels such as food delivery apps (FDAs). (Gossling et al.,2020). In this manner, customers have the option to purchase food in the comfort of their homes and save more time and effort since there is no requirement to stand in long queues to pay and risk their health in physical stores. They can buy food through food delivery applications and pay using online credit and debit cards or cash upon delivery. The delivery time in a food delivery business is a crucial factor since it is one of the strong predictors of customer satisfaction in buying foods online, as well as the service quality, price, and condition of food delivered (Saad, A. 2020). Food delivery businesses must aim to provide convenience, accessibility, and exceptional service to promote a good company image that will surely attract more customers in the future. Through the observation of their daily operation as well as interviews on the management of the business itself, overall root causes are compiled and listed using a fishbone diagram. It shows that management, natural events, people (rider and customer), and process technology are the four general root causes of late deliveries of the business. To further highlight the ultimate root cause of late deliveries, different root cause analysis tools are used: the five why analysis and scatterplot diagram. The results obtained in the five why analysis concluded that the main root cause of late deliveries is the delays caused by store factors and that the management of the business should have countermeasures for it. It also results in another tool used in this study which is the scatterplot diagram, that delays caused by stores have a more linear relationship and a highly correlated factor with late deliveries. Focusing on the delay caused by the store as the main root cause of the late deliveries as concluded in the root cause analysis performed, researchers proposed several recommendations to particularly solve store delay. The recommendation proposed by the researchers is designing a new delivery system flow to particularly reduce the late delivery caused by store factors. This new delivery system proposed includes riders calling the store first to place an order through the store's hotline number, and delivery updates wherein adding communication between riders and customers to update them if there would be delays or other unexpected situations. Through these delivery updates, wherein customers will be updated to unexpected delays caused by the store, a tentative 30 minutes are added to the customer's expected time of arrival of their orders, wherein it is the tentative maximum delay of their order. This store delay includes the preparation of orders, long queue lines, etc. A feedback form is also proposed to be answered by customers at the end of the service. Getting customer feedback can further improve the service provided by the business. An additional recommendation is having an application on the smartphone to have a clear record of the 801","ivy mar j. ramos faculty at industrial engineering department, college of engineering bulacan state university, city of malolos, bulacan, philippines ivymar.ramos@bulsu.edu.ph gian g. cayabyab, erika beatrice dc. garcia, chabelita b. panao, john miguel b. yandan industrial engineering department bulacan state university city of malolos, bulacan, philippines","References

80,How Do Albanian Companies Utilize Total Quality  Management?,"for over three decades, total quality management (tqm) has been widely acknowledged as a crucial strategy for organizations. the present article aims to delineate how albanian companies utilize quality management practices. to this end, a survey comprising 800 respondents was conducted to investigate the current status of quality management practices utilization in albania the analysis of qm practices unveiled that companies tend to favor the usage and accord greater importance to soft practices such as teamwork and customer focus. contrarily, companies tend to attach less significance to and abstain from using hard practices such as analysis of variance and six sigma. according to the respondents, albanian companies are positioned at a mid-level stage of qm maturity level, with more than 50% attesting that their companies are at the ""inspection"" age and less than 30% stating that their companies have accomplished strategic quality management. this unsatisfactory level of qm maturity may imply that albanian companies prioritize quality management with more focus on inspection and control rather than quality assurance and strategic management. as such, ""improvement"" in this context may signify bringing the operation back to the standard rather than improving the standard. ultimately, future research endeavors stemming from these findings could explore how qm practices could be effectively employed to help companies achieve higher qm maturity levels and strategic quality management.",survey,"According to the findings of this research, Albanian companies exhibit an intermediate level of quality maturity. Such a level implies that companies are more inclined towards quality management through inspection and control activities. Thus, addressing improvement in this area could mean bringing operations back to a standard rather than enhancing the standard. Although the study reveals that many quality principles and techniques are employed by these companies, advanced improvement techniques such as QFD, and Six Sigma are still underutilized and deemed of less significance. Despite Quality Management being a well-established and widespread concept that has undergone constant development in recent decades, many organizations are yet to realize its strategic benefits. Consequently, Albanian companies have a substantial opportunity to enhance their quality and productivity levels. Further research could explore how QM practices can be effectively implemented to help companies achieve higher Quality Management maturity levels and strategic quality management.","jonida teta associate professor in the department of production and management faculty of mechanical engineering polytechnic university of tirana tirana, albania jteta@fim.edu.al dea sinoimeri researcher in the department of production and management faculty of mechanical engineering polytechnic university of tirana tirana, albania dsinoimeri@fim.edu.al",

83,Optimizing Nurse And Dialysis Unit Scheduling  For Hemodialysis Patients,"as the prevalence of kidney disease continues to rise, the increasing demand for dialysis services must be addressed to ensure efficient and patient-centric care. currently, hemodialysis poses significant challenges for patients, and it is clear that there is a need to improve the scheduling process to enhance their overall experience. this paper proposes an optimization strategy that can be implemented to improve nurse and dialysis unit scheduling for the benefit of patients. a case study from a unit on an island in tunisia (north africa) is considered to illustrate that optimizing nurse and dialysis unit scheduling can better accommodate the growing number of patients requiring hemodialysis and provide timely and accessible care. this includes strategically managing resources, ensuring appropriate staffing levels, and implementing efficient scheduling systems that prioritize patient needs. this paper recognizes the importance of optimizing appointment scheduling for patients in the dialysis unit, while also considering the constraints on nurses and equipment availability. by minimizing patient wait times, implementing a safety net measure, and exploring innovative solutions, it is shown that the quality, reliability, and efficiency of care provided in the hemodialysis setting is improved. this research contributes to the broader goal of improving patient experiences, addressing healthcare provider challenges, and optimizing resource utilization in dialysis units.","dialysis scheduling, patient care","In this paper, an optimization strategy was proposed to enhance nurse and dialysis unit scheduling, resulting in improved care for patients. This study demonstrates that optimizing nurse and dialysis unit scheduling can successfully accommodate the increasing number of patients in need of hemodialysis while ensuring timely and accessible care. An integer programming model was prepared for this purpose. The objective function of the model was to minimize dialysis times, and this was achieved by scheduling all patients three times per week, as per the requirement, as well as ensuring that the patients are given enough time to bleed if necessary while considering cleaning, preparation, and shift times. Further development of this study could include collecting data based on patient availability and performing the optimization based on this availability. During our optimization, the aim was to minimize the number of machines used, and the minimum number of machines required to schedule 36 patients for three sessions in a week was 9. Three machines are kept on standby in case of breakdowns, and maintenance is kept out of the summer months, so we are not losing a machine while we have more patients. During the other months of the year, there are only 27 patients, meaning, since the current unit capacity was shown to accommodate the busy summer months, it can therefore handle the less busy months throughout the year. The approach presented in this paper involves strategic resource management, maintaining appropriate staffing levels, and implementing efficient scheduling systems that prioritize patient needs. The mathematical programming model presented in this paper has been designed as a deterministic problem, disregarding uncertainties at this stage. Future work will consider the incorporation of various uncertainties, such as uncertainties related to patient no-shows, late arrivals, and unpredictable durations for dialysis treatments.","bedis elkamel department of health sciences university of central florida orlando, florida, usa elkamelbedis@gmail.com abdennaceur fgaier and anis mekki hôpital régional salim el-hadhri de kerkennah kerkennah, tunisia abedo71@yahoo.fr, mekkianis711@gmail.com",
84,A Threshold Based Proactive Maintenance Policy For Multicomponent Systems Using Dbns,"today, with the ever-increasing technology, the environments in which companies are in competition have also increased and most companies have started to use machines that are more technological and require less manpower. while this may seem like an advantage in many respects, the complexity of the machinery used complicates many things. at the beginning of these difficulties is the determination of the maintenance policies of the machines. the occurrence of an unexpected malfunction in such systems causes serious problems such as product delays, lost sales and customer dissatisfactions. on the other hand, over-maintenance to reduce unexpected downtime can lead to unnecessary maintenance costs. in order to achieve the balance, it is of great importance to reduce reactive maintenance by keeping the number of proactive maintenance at the optimum level. in this study, a threshold based proactive maintenance policy is presented for multi-component systems where there exist stochastic and structural dependencies among the components. the proposed strategy is a predictive one that determines the proactive maintenance times of the system by considering the current system reliability. a tabu procedure is also proposed within the strategy to prevent the same component from being repeatedly selected for maintenance when frequent proactive maintenance is planned. dynamic bayesian networks, which are successful in expressing the dependencies and time based relations between components, is used to model the system and to compute the required inferences. as a case study, the policy is simulated on a regenerative air heater system which is used in thermal power plants and compared with other policies under different scenarios. the results indicate that the threshold based proactive policy gives the minimum maintenance cost in almost all scenarios. moreover, it is also successful in decreasing the number of maintenance in a planning horizon due to its effective component selection method at a maintenance time.",,,"demet özgür-ünlüakın assistant professor of industrial engineering faculty of engineering and natural sciences işık university istanbul, turkey demet.unluakin@isikun.edu.tr busenur türkali özbek research assistant in industrial engineering faculty of engineering and natural sciences işık university istanbul, turkey busenur.turkali@isikun.edu.tr",

86,Impact Of Handle Position And Riveting Tools On Vibration  And Muscle Fatigue In Riveters And Buckers,"the prevalence of muscle fatigue among riveters and buckers in the aeronautical industry is predominantly linked to their significant exposure to excessive vibrations. frequently surpassing the daily exposure limit value (delv) of 5 m/s², these skilled workers are subjected to elevated vibrations. to address this concern, the present research investigates the influence of different riveting tools on vibration exposure and muscle fatigue. while prior studies have individually examined these factors, a notable gap remains regarding comprehensive and concurrent investigations. therefore, further exploration is imperative to enhance our understanding of this critical issue and potentially inform the development of effective mitigation strategies. an experimental study with ten male participants equally divided between riveters and buckers was performed to achieve the objective of this study. the task consisted of setting five rivets in 30 seconds. acceleration, emg, heart rate, handle orientation, and perceived exertion data were recorded simultaneously from riveters and buckers. the perceived exertion (borg scale) was used to measure participants' overall perceived exertion level. the results indicate that the combined spring dampener and tungsten bucking bar led to 24.46% less vibration than the tungsten or steel bucking bar. in addition, the riveter gun operator with a vertical handle position resulted in the highest mean % mvc of the bucker's biceps brachii muscle (61.11%) compared to the riveter using the gun in the horizontal handle position (30.84%). the results demonstrate the need to consider the type of gun and handle position in which the rivet gun operator performs the task to reduce the effects of vibration exposure and muscle fatigue experienced by the riveters and buckers.","fatigue, vibration, riveters, buckers",,"fereydoun aghazadeh, and vamsi pusapati department of mechanical and industrial engineering, louisiana state university baton rouge, louisiana, usa aghazadeh@lsu.edu, vpusap1@lsu.edu lou t. vi deloitte and touche llp, houston, texas, usa viloushcarine@yahoo.fr anthony banks lockheed martin corporation, bethesda, md, usa anthony.d.banks@lmco.com",
87,"Supply Chain Responsiveness:   Dimensions, Relationships And Impact On Performance","the increasing pace in the industry and the growing complexity of supply chains worldwide are incremental phenomena demanding changes and adaptation in terms of supply chain management (scm). however, no one could anticipate the profound impact caused by changes in demand during the covid-19 pandemic, the magnitude of the disruptions, and their effects for such a long period. companies need to reorganize and transform to accommodate and respond to shortages, market shifts, or product changes. more than being efficient, supply chains need to be responsive. responsiveness enables supply chains to deliver the right product, at the right place, within an adequate time frame. however, research on how to develop responsive strategies applied to scm is still scarce. as a concept, responsiveness is well-defined and accepted as a relevant topic in the field. some studies present conceptual models of responsiveness based on dimensions to be developed and managed by companies. volume, product, and process have been proposed as dimensions of responsiveness. more recently, a new foundational theory emerged, addressing the dynamic potential of the supply chain and identifying responsiveness as the base upon which to build knowledge. according to this theory, responsiveness is achieved by combining five dimensions: adaptability, flexibility, agility, improvisation, and resilience. on the one hand, these dimensions represent no novelty to the field of scm; on the other hand, there needs to be a clear indication of the right combination to achieve the desired level of responsiveness. in addition, it is relevant to ascertain the relationships identified between the dimensions. when an improvement in one of the dimensions leads to the same result in another one, synergies might be harvested. still, it is necessary to consider the hypothesis of having dimensions competing for the same resources. in situations where such tensions arise, it is essential to discern and manage conflicting perspectives. this study adopts a theoretical responsiveness model proposed in the literature as the starting point for the work developed. the responsiveness dimensions included in the model are studied from two perspectives: first, the right combination of dimensions for the intended level of responsiveness and, second, the tensions between the different dimensions. in what concerns the first perspective, dynamic capabilities facilitate reaching the adequate combination of dimensions and pursuing the right strategy to achieve responsiveness. regarding the second perspective, paradox theory provides a framework for understanding and managing tensions between responsiveness dimensions arising from competition for resources and inner conflicts. finally, the impact of responsiveness on performance is studied, considering the moderating role of industry clockspeed, as different industries vary in pace, the company´s position in the supply chain, and environmental uncertainty.","responsiveness, paradox theory",,"carla cruz, luís miguel d. f. ferreira university of coimbra, cemmpre, arise, department of mechanical engineering, polo ii coimbra, 3030-788, portugal carla.r.cruz@dem.uc.pt, luis.ferreira@dem.uc.pt",
88,Gender Equity And Diversity In Academia: Intersectional  Analysis Of Academic Staff In Israel Via Process Mining,"this paper explores the intricate relationship between gender equity and diversity in academia, arguing that these two goals are not mutually exclusive or independent, but rather intricately intertwined. while existing discourse on gender equity in academia focuses primarily on the obstacles women face within the academic system, and discussions on diversity in academia concentrate on barriers preventing underrepresented groups from entering academia, this study contends that an intersectional framework is crucial for understanding and addressing inequalities within academic institutions. drawing on the concept of intersectionality (crenshaw, 1989), our research applies process mining methodology (van der aalst, 2016) to examine the inequalities prevalent among tenured academic staff in israel. we collected data from university sites, encompassing approximately 400 tenure track members, and utilized the celonis software to create a dashboard for comprehensive data analysis and visualization. by mapping the composition of the academic workforce and their promotion processes based on intersecting factors such as gender, ethnicity, and nationality, our study offers unique insights and demonstrates the potential of digital humanities in the israeli context. the application of process mining techniques combined with the use of the celonis software enables a detailed review of the collected data, providing a comprehensive understanding of the power dynamics and obstacles hindering true and sustainable equality in academic institutions. building upon our prior research (gigi, nagar-ron, yehuda, and razi, 2020), which highlighted the importance of intersectional analysis in understanding gender, ethnicity, and nationality dynamics among academic staff, we further expose the ethno-gendered and national-gendered nature of inequality. additionally, our findings shed light on disparities in representation and advancement between first-tier academic institutions (universities) and second-tier ones (colleges). this paper presents preliminary research findings and emphasizes the significance of employing an intersectional lens to comprehensively grasp the diverse power mechanisms and obstacles hindering true and sustainable equality within academic institutions. the insights garnered from this study, facilitated by the utilization of process mining and celonis software, have implications for both researchers and policymakers, fostering a more nuanced understanding of gender equity and diversity and aiding in the development of effective strategies to promote equality in academia.","gender equity, diversity, intersectionality, academic staff, process mining",,"sagit kedem-yemini logistics department sapir academic college sderot, israel sagity@mail.sapir.ac.il sigal nagar-ron and tammy razi multi-disciplinary studies sapir academic college sderot, israel sigalro@sapir.ac.il, tamarr@sapir.ac.il",
89,Drivers And Barriers For Sustainable And Efficient  Biomass Valorization Processes,,,"The analysis of the findings from the systematic literature review and the cross-case analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of the drivers and barriers in supply chain mapping studies for biomass valorization. Supportive government policies that incentivize and regulate the valorization of residual biomass promote sustainable practices and attract investment in the sector. The market’s inclination towards sustainable and renewable solutions is reflected in the increasing interest in biobased products. Job creation, particularly in rural areas, contributes to the socio- economic development of local communities. However, several barriers hinder the widespread adoption of biomass valorization projects. Insufficient financial support mechanisms and high investment costs pose significant challenges. The dominance of conventional products and markets creates obstacles for the acceptance of biobased alternatives. Concerns over the impact of biomass production on food security and prices further complicate the debate. Balancing the use of agricultural resources for food production and energy production requires careful consideration and sustainable land-use planning. The cross-case analysis focuses on the operations and challenges within the supply chains of residual forestry biomass valorization. It reveals insights into transportation expenses and the bargaining power between farmers and logging companies. Material flow analysis facilitated decision-making on production planning and resource allocation. Strategies to optimize transportation efficiency were suggested to reduce costs and improve profitability. The limited bargaining power of farmers and forest owners in negotiating biomass prices leads to unfair trade practices. Empowering these stakeholders through knowledge-sharing initiatives can enhance their bargaining power. By understanding these findings, decision-makers can develop effective strategies to address financial challenges, create supportive policies, promote market acceptance of biomass valorization, optimize material flows, address transportation cost disparities, and enhance the bargaining power of stakeholders.

90,Industry 4.0 And Its Importance In Statistical  Process Control,"nowadays, with the enormous competitiveness in the market, companies must adopt techniques that not only allow them to deliver a quality product but also help them predict situations of uncertainty regarding customer demand. thus, it is imperative that some tools are integrated simultaneously throughout the production processes to achieve this goal. it is the only way for many companies to spot themselves in a significant market position, given that modern manufacturing demands not only more intelligence but also safer and more reliable process monitoring systems (cheng et al. 2019). the study supervised in this document aimed to analyze the application of statistical process control (spc) in industry 4.0. for this purpose, a systematic literature review was conducted, which allowed identifying the main approaches used to integrate statistical analysis with production processes in industry 4.0, as well as the main tools and technologies employed for this purpose. a total of 21 articles were analyzed, considering inclusion and exclusion criteria related to the subject matter, with greater importance given to articles that explicitly addressed the integration between industry 4.0 and spc. according to the conducted systematic review, it was concluded that digital technologies are transforming spc in industry 4.0 in several ways. some of the main transformations include: i) real-time monitoring, as digital technologies allow processes to be monitored in real-time, enabling immediate problem detection and informed data- driven decision-making; ii) automation, as there are models and systems that already work with spc and industry 4.0 technologies in a fully automated manner, increasing process efficiency and reducing the need for human intervention; iii) advanced analysis, where digital technologies enable advanced analysis of collected data, allowing the identification of patterns and trends that would be difficult or impossible to detect manually; iv) integration with other technologies, as spc can be integrated with other industry 4.0 technologies such as artificial intelligence, internet of things, big data, among other tools, to create more comprehensive and efficient solutions. in other words, digital technologies are enabling a significant transformation in spc in industry 4.0, making it more efficient, accurate, and integrated with other available technological solutions. 889",,"drawn here. One possibility is the development of artificial intelligence systems to enhance SPC, as AI can be used to analyze large amounts of real-time data collected through sensors and help identify patterns and anomalies in processes. In summary, the results of this study demonstrate that Statistical Process Control can be a valuable tool to improve the efficiency and quality of industrial processes in Industry 4.0, as long as it is applied appropriately and integrated with available digital technologies.

92,The Impact Of Supply Chain Management On South  African Local Government Municipalities’,"the aim of the study is to evaluate the impact of supply chain management (scm) on the operations of ekurhuleni metropolitan municipality (emm), a local municipality in the gauteng province of south africa. this aim is intended to enhance supply chain management efficiency and effectiveness at emm and other related local government municipalities in south africa with a view to enhance institutional performance. the study was necessitated by the wide spread reported scm challenges facing the south african local government. quantitative research, descriptive research and explanatory research were employed in the investigation. the findings of the study confirmed that scm has a positive and significant impact on the financial performance of the metropolitan municipality. introduction supply chain management is critical in the financial management for the public sector in south africa. an ineffective and inefficient supply chain management leads to poor financial management in any entity whether public entity or private entity. emm has been struggling with weaknesses in its supply chain management system (legodi 2017:58). in the 2016/2017 financial year the metropolitan municipality failed to get a clean audit. this was largely attributed to irregular, fruitless and wasteful expenditure (annual financial report 2017). the government has put measures in place to ensure the local government municipalities like emm enhance their supply chain management function. upon attaining democratic rule in 1994, the south african government put in place budgetary and financial reforms on supply chain management (ambe & badenhorst-weiss, 2012:245). the reforms were earmarked to modernise the supply chain management as well as to meet the needs of communities. the supply chain management reform is articulated in section 112 of the municipal financial management act no 56 of 2003 (mfma) and in 76(4) (c) of the public finance management act no 1 of 1999 (pfma) (ambe & badenhorst-weiss 2012:245). thus, the reforms in procurement in the public sector are made mandatory by existing acts of parliament. this makes non-compliance with the reforms a criminal offence. the national treasury is at the forefront of ensuring all public sector institutions are complying with reform clauses in the mfma and pfma. there is also the auditor general south africa (agsa), an independent public external audit institution that audits the public sector institutions annually to ensure they are complying with relevant clauses in the mfma and pfma. despite the efforts of the national treasury to capacitate personnel in local government municipalities with relevant skills, implementation of supply chain management remains a challenge in the municipalities (ambe & badenhorst-weiss 2012:11003). according to ambe and badenhorst-weiss (2012 :11003), major deficiencies relating to supply chain management in local government municipalities relate to procurement policies, procedures and controls. this study has been carried out in the context of supply chain management deficiencies in the local government municipalities despite the efforts by the government to enhance supply chain management systems in the public sector. the ekurhuleni metropolitan municipality is not an exception to the supply chain management weaknesses that are being faced by other municipalities in south africa. 903",,,"financial performance ernest lasie mgidi (ernest.mgidi@ekurhuleni.gov.za) university of johannesburg, south africa professor pule kholopane (pule.kholopane@gmail.com) university of johannesburg, south africa",
93,Improve The Efficiency Of Sample Collection And Analysis In  Service Orders Request Using Markov Chains,"labchem's corp. in mayagüez, puerto rico, is facing challenges with long waiting times and delays in sample delivery due to their telephone-based service request management system. to address these issues and improve their operational efficiency, the company is exploring using markov chains to establish order request transition probabilities. this methodology has been successfully used in other supply chain projects to minimize costs and improve lead times. then, can labchem’s corp. make its process efficient by knowing in advance (the next 2 to 4 weeks) order request transition probabilities while drivers are already on the route? our project aims to design and implement a streamlined service request management system that will enhance labchem's corp.’s sample collection and analysis process. for example, the highest transition probabilities for the fourth week were 0.3874 (april) and 0.3229 (may) for transitions between states 2-3 and 4-3. these results suggest that efforts should be focused on preventing events originating in states 2, 3, and 4. ultimately, this proposed service request management system could serve as a valuable model for other companies seeking to improve their competitiveness in the marketplace.",markov chain,"In this research, we propose using Markov Chains to improve the service request process of LabChem'S Corp. and reduce their waiting times. By analyzing data and applying n-step transition probabilities and Chapman-Kolmogorov Equations from Markov Chains, we set the grounds for the company so they can improve their efficiency. Performing this analysis, LabChem'S Corp. could also improve its service request process, reduce waiting times, and increase customer satisfaction. Furthermore, the company can use the Chapman-Kolmogorov equations to calculate the n-step transition probabilities for a Markov chain and use this information to make informed decisions and improve the efficiency of the process. The design of this new service request management process for LabChem'S Corp. will increase efficiency, reduce waiting times, and increase customer satisfaction. It also will facilitate identifying and prioritizing the improvement of critical areas inside the company’s service request process and develop an action plan to address these areas of concern. By analyzing the transition probabilities associated with different scenarios, we were able to identify areas of opportunity and develop strategies that will be useful to improve the quality of the process. These strategies included strengthening customer communication channels, implementing a service request template, and establishing clear request timelines. When comparing April and May data, we observed variations in transition probabilities associated with LabChem'S Corp. service requests. This data analysis exercise reinforced the importance of proposed improvements, such as validating route availability and improving customer communication channels. In addition, the analysis helped LabChem'S Corp. understand the impact of these events on the process and enabled it to make informed decisions to improve efficiency and turnaround times. Therefore, by applying Markov Chains and analyzing the data, we provided LabChem'S Corp. with valuable information and recommendations to improve its service request process.

94,Utilizing The Dmaic Methodology To Drive A Built-Inquality Changeover Process In A Thermoforming Line For,"automotive component manufacturers are some of the organizations that are faced with a lot of complexities in their manufacturing streams. these complexities require a number of changeovers on the lines according to the sequences and derivatives that are required by customers. one of the challenges that component manufacturers face is the outflow of defective parts post their changeovers which hinders the ability to deliver and reduces capacities. an automotive component manufacturer which manufactures various bedliners was concerned about the outflow of defective parts after every changeover on their thermoforming line. this pointed directly to a lack of built-in-quality in their changeover processes. this was primarily reflected in their approach of frequently adjusting the moulding machine and relentless reworking of the work being done in the moulds after changeover completion. this resulted in multiple destructive tests, high defect rates, and major delays in their ability to run the line and deliver to their customers. given the magnitude of the problem in the organization, the aim of this study was to utilize the lean six sigma define, measure, analyse, improve, and control (dmaic) methodology to bring about significant improvement in driving built-in-quality in the changeover process execution for the line. the results of the study were a streamlined approach to this problem, reduced defect occurrences after changeovers, and an overall changeover process that encompasses a built-in-quality approach in its execution.","dmaic methodology, changeover, built-in-quality","The study employed the lean six sigma DMAIC methodology to streamline an approach towards developing a built-in-quality centred approach to changeovers. The DMAIC methodology has proven to be effective in this study, as it established to a large extent a pathway for automotive component manufacturers to follow in order to drive quality in their changeover processes. The study has unearthed to an extent that there is largely ignorance around built-in-quality in changeover processes. The focus is primarily on the quickest way to wrap up changeovers and giving less consideration to the quality of products after the changeovers. The automotive component manufacturer needed to incorporate a multi-disciplinary approach to the execution of changeovers. The employment of built-in-quality strategies during changeovers brings into light significant benefits such as reduced defective unit outflow, increased capacities, ability to cope with complexities, and increased profitability. The first objective of the study was met through an outline of the possible defects, causes and the elements associated with the occurrence of the defects.

95,Supply Chain Risks Management In Manufacturing  Industry. Case Study From A Developing Country,"supply chain risk management has raised companies' and researchers' focus on the supply chain environment. the definition and consequences of risk in a company's supply chain depend on its position and the depth of analysis it can conduct. developing countries' companies, such as those in albania, perceive supply chain risk management as an expenditure that does not generate profit, so they do not allocate funds or personnel to it. the recent financial crisis caused by the consequences of covid-19 worldwide suggested that countries urgently need to implement effective risk management processes in all sectors of the economy. companies must understand which risks should be accepted, avoided, transferred, mitigated, or exploited. this article studies a company in the albanian textile industry using hierarchical holographic modeling (hhm). the model implemented involved assigning risk management responsibilities to a specific employee over time limit intervals. furthermore, the company's overall risk management capabilities and competencies are enhanced as an intangible outcome. this article aims to identify strategies the company uses to mitigate risks and improve the performance of the supply chain. from the results obtained from this article, managerial perceptivity can be deduced on how to manage supply chain risk in the future.","risk management, supply chain, decision-making","The proposed risk management model provides a comprehensive risk analysis tool using a top-down approach which helps a company understand its risks better and have a better chance of success. Applying the HHM and SCRM, risks have been identified, and the company could prioritize risks so that options to mitigate the risk can be appropriately considered and addressed. Most of the uncertainties and risks that the Textile industry is facing have been identiﬁed by HHM. The most likely and high-level risks in the industry are identiﬁed. SCRM method was applied to identify the company`s risks, triggers, and current mitigation strategies. Furthermore, some additional outstanding risks are provided for the case company to avoid or transfer those risks. The proposed model provides theoretical merits to the literature and applies to different industries for risk management practices. Today, customer has higher expectations in terms of speed of delivery and service quality. It is challenging for a company to sustain efﬁcient product ﬂow and on-time delivery simultaneously. In order to ensure the ﬂexibility of the supply chain, a company should have internal competencies to manage its external partners. Therefore, further research is required to combine the risk management model with the customer and supplier relationship management concept.","eralda xhafka, dea sinoimeri, jonida teta lecturer in the department of production and management polytechnic university of tirana tirana, albania exhafka@fim.edu.al, dsinoimeri@fim.edu.al, jteta@fim.edu.al",
96,Improvement Proposal Using Postural Ergonomics  And Engineering Design In An Educational,"the lack of inclusive educational interventions for children with behavioural disorders exacerbates the already concerning problem of school failure in peru. there is a scarcity of educational proposals that intertwine psychology and engineering, leaving the study of the impacts of postural ergonomics on selective attention unattended despite the frequent mismatch between the furniture and the student’s anthropometric measurements. consequently, this interdisciplinary research, through a case study of peruvian primary school children disaggregated into adhd (neurodivergent) and non-adhd (neurotypical) samples, evaluates the impact of postural ergonomics on selective attention and further assesses the difference between the magnitude of such impact on the neurodivergent and neurotypical samples. the impact assessment is based on the correlation between the d2r test for selective attention results and the evaluation of postural ergonomic correctness. results from the paired t-test coupled with a cohen’s-d of over 1.95 demonstrate that correct ergonomic posture leads to a significant improvement in selective attention and that such improvement is +1.5 points higher for neurotypicals than for neurodivergents. ultimately, to provide a tangible improvement to education, and after defining the incoherence between current school furniture and the sample’s anthropometric measurements, recommended measurements for adjustable furniture for peruvian schools that ensure correct postural ergonomics are proposed.","postural ergonomics, education, adhd",,"environment: case study rafael chavez-ugaz professor in the department of engineering & architecture universidad de lima lima, peru rchavez@ulima.edu.pe shirel pardo, maria lucia pérez industrial engineering student at university of lima universidad de lima lima, peru pardo.shirel@gmail.com, marialuciaperezmartinez@gmail.com","References

97,Demand-Based Street Lights Electrical Consumption Reduction  In Industrial Cities Utilizing Internet Of Things,"the lighting system is an essential component of any industrial city's infrastructure for drivers' safety to prevent accidents and facilitate ease of guidance as an accessibility manner to the city. however, street lighting accounts for a significant portion of the overall energy consumption in industrial cities that does not reflect the actual vehicles passing the street or the intended purpose of the lights. in this paper, we propose a smart sensing model to reduce street lights' electrical consumption based on demand using an internet of things (iot) camera with a license plate recognition (lpr) function that detects vehicles. if a vehicle is detected using lpr, the street lights will be turned on for 15 seconds to allow the vehicle to pass the street, then turn off part of the street lights if no other vehicles are detected as an ideal status of the lights. our results concluded that the proposed smart sensing model accomplishes its objective by achieving the highest street light electrical reduction in one hour across five days, which is 89.17 % for half of the lights controlled using iot. moreover, the highest average reduction for all five days with a period of 12 hours is 74.09% compared to regular status.","reduction, demand, street light","The smart sensing model will reduce street lights electrical consumption. The primary aspect for utilizing IoT cameras in the smart sensing model is the cost-effectiveness, that allows for street lights to be operated based on demand of actual vehicles entering the street. The smart sensing model proposed to reduce the street light electrical consumption and the fundamental components of the model are to have the lights turned on for 15 seconds and 50% of the street lights will be on all the time. Therefore, based on the work presented in this research, here are some recommendations that can be potential of future work as following: • A higher reduction can be reached if the delay 15 seconds were lower. This depends on the street length and other factors such as vehicles seed limit, number of lanes and others. • The lowering of the 50% percentage of street lights that is set to be on all the time will lead to further reduction. Therefore, more optimistic results will be, but must account for the adhering of safety requirements for pedestrians and vehicles stopped on the side of the main road. • The number of the industrial city’s main entrances and size of the of the industrial city will influence the reduction of street lights electrical consumptions. • The scaling of the smart sensing model to not only be utilized on the main road, but also expanding it all street lights in the industrial city. • Setting a predefine delay to not be fix as 15 seconds, but to be as per the type of vehicles detected. The truck time delay should be different than the small vehicle or other type of vehicles as the speed is different.

The researchers suggested four (4) recipe formulations that differ in the number of product ingredients. The different proposed recipes undergo sensory evaluation in terms of taste, color, texture, flavor, and odor by various potential consumers. The experimental technique and procedures were utilized in this study and consisted of experimentation concerning variables and quantitative adverbial scoring of different treatments. Based on the findings and interpretation drawn from the data gathered, the most preferred product formulation of sea urchin food chips is treatment two (2), with the highest overall product characteristics ratings. Treatment three (3) closely garnered the second most acceptable product treatment, followed by treatment one (1) with ratings above general acceptability. Finally, treatment four (4) was obtained below the global mean of all four product attributes except for the odor. According to the survey results, treatment two (2) was the most favored recipe formulation among the four suggested recipes. In terms of product characteristics, under the most favored product treatment, ""taste"" appeared as the essential product attribute of sea urchin chips, followed by ""flavor,"" ""texture,"" and ""odor,"" with ""color"" being the least significant feature. The socio-demographic segmentation of the respondents might have influenced the results. The majority of the respondents are young adults (ages 18-24), which mostly goes for practicality and prioritizing taste other than other factors. The educational background was also seen to have affected the results since most of the respondents are at college level and in high school, indicating that the results gathered are directly from the consumers and not from the food experts.","exchel armenton, lainesie pastor, philbert misa, and sarah jane abatayo industrial engineering student cebu technological university – main campus cebu city, 6000, philippines exchelarmenton@gmail.com, steffilainesie@gmail.com, philbertmisa00@gmail.com, sarrabatayo@gmail.com ike baguio, and teresita capin core faculty in industrial engineering department cebu technological university – main campus cebu city, 6000, philippines ike.baguio@ctu.edu.ph, terisita.capin@ctu.edu.ph",

The main causes of these incidents include fuel leaks, mechanical failures, electrical faults, and human error. While these incidents are rare, they can be catastrophic, underscoring the importance of identifying and addressing potential hazards to prevent these incidents from occurring. Through our literature review, we have identified several best practices for preventing fires and explosions in gas turbines. These include regular maintenance, appropriate safety systems, training and procedures, risk assessment, proper combustion, and environmental controls. By implementing these best practices, gas turbine operators can reduce the risk of incidents and ensure the safe and reliable operation of these critical pieces of equipment. This study utilized the Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA) method, which prioritizes failures based on their Risk Priority Number (RPN), to analyze Gas Turbine Power Plants (GTPPS), during the analysis of primary subsystems and auxiliary subsystems, a total of 44 distinct failure modes were identified. Out of the identified failure modes, three are classified as critical system failures that necessitate the development of a specialized maintenance plan. In summary, while fires and explosions in gas turbines are rare occurrences, they have significant safety implications. It is crucial for gas turbine operators to be aware of potential hazards and implement appropriate safety measures to prevent these incidents from occurring. By doing so, we can ensure the safe and reliable operation of gas turbines and protect workers, property, and the environment from the devastating consequences of fires and explosions. Overall, the findings of this research paper underscore the importance of gas turbine safety and highlight the need for ongoing efforts to mitigate the risk of fires and explosions in these critical pieces of equipment. By taking a comprehensive and proactive approach to safety, gas turbine operators can ensure the safe and reliable operation of their equipment, protect workers and the environment, and prevent devastating incidents from occurring. 1054","noora b. almansoori electrical engineer health, safety and environment engineering department of industrial and systems engineering khalifa university abu dhabi, united arab emirates nobalmansoori@ku.ac.ae jwahir albreiki and maryam alkatheeri health, safety and environment engineering department of industrial and systems engineering khalifa university abu dhabi, united arab emirates jwmalbreiki@ku.ac.ae, 100044614@ku.ac.ae","References

104,Bnpp Spent Fuel Pool Fire Protection  Shaikh Ali Al Nuaimi,"this paper is reviewing the causes and risks of initiating a fire in the spent fuel pool of nuclear power plants (npps) and the current capabilities to extinguish or prevent spent fuel fires from occurring to propose new applications supporting preventing or mitigating spent fuel fires to ensure the safety of the people, assets, and environment. this paper addresses many lessons from the fukushima daiichi accident and other research experiments done on spent fuel pools. furthermore, risk assessments such as hazop and fta were developed to come up with recommendations and new preventive measures that can be implemented in bnnp and other nuclear power plants around the world.","bnnp, spent fuel pool, spent fuel fire, zirconium fire","Summary This paper aims to cover the risk assessment of the spent fuel pool fires and support the need of the country to produce energy based on nuclear fuel. As seen in the literature review section, the main function of the spent fuel is to store the used fuel and cool it as the fuel will generate decay heat. So, the cooling of the fuel rods is critical to avoid fires or explosions and based on the literature review, the failure in cooling the spent fuel pools or the loss of the energy that supplies cooling will lead to fire or explosion in the presence of hydrogen gas. This is supported by the Fukushima Daiichi incident, where a tsunami led to the loss of energy that led to the loss of cooling and an explosion in unit 4 as hydrogen gas was present. This is related to the heating of the used fuel rods covered with Zirconium, a metal that at a certain heating range will start ignition. Therefore, the focus of this paper is to find new ways of extinguishing or preventing such types of fire in nuclear power plants as spent fuel is necessary in all nuclear power plants. The paper reviews what is available in today’s world and suggests modifications or new methods to succeed with the paper's aims. The paper covered several assessments starting with Historical analysis, HAZOP, and Fault Tree Analysis (FTA). Each of these together supports finding the major risk in the support of the literature review to avoid spent fuel first. As a result, the paper proposes an innovative design of a system that works in case of losing the energy in the spent fuels. This proposal includes calculations of the design and its ability to cover and cool the fuel, in addition to a 3D illustration with actual diminutions. Recommendation and Suggestions Based on the findings, we suggest doing further research that includes testing the prototype that has been designed in this paper. The testing shall include the durability of holding such weight above the spent fuel pools. In addition, the tests shall involve alternative ways of starting the designed tank in case of a total loss of energy. We recommend further risk analysis of the design to ensure that the prototype is not adding new risks to the current situation. In addition, both the (HAZOP) Analysis and Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) suggest further points of the spent fuel pool assessment, which can be further studied to add another layer of protection by eliminating or substituting a risk that can be avoided with further study. Combined with the literature review and the data analysis, the paper suggests a design of a passive source of water and cooling supply for the spent fuel pool. This tank is a flying tank, which is also suggested to replace the Boric Acid Storage Tank (BAST) as it has a good concentration of Boron acid ranging between 4000-4400 ppm based on “proposed technical specification changes related to boron injection tank elimination”. It is recommended to have further study and research to understand the dynamic effects of such a choice on other systems. Conclusion To conclude, the usage of nuclear energy as a source of renewable and clean energy is the trend of countries in the world as it produces less CO2 in comparison to traditional fossil fuels. Nuclear energy fuel, like all other sources of energy, imposes certain risks, and with the vision to seek less production of CO2 with the growing need for energy, countries shall seek cleaner energy with the highest safety measures. The nuclear energy industry had two major accidents that changed the way the world sees such sources. However, in this paper, the aim is to learn from earlier experiences and accidents to suggest new methods, ways, and designs to prevent one of the major incidents in Fukushima Daiichi, which is the spent fuel pool explosion and fire. This paper designed a flying tank with the ability to ensure the cooling of the spent fuel even in major shutdowns of energy by any circumstances. The design is a prototype and requires further analysis and testing to ensure the suitability of the design in the real world and analysis of what kind of other risks this design could add to the spent fuel pool area.

105,Systematic Framework For Industrial Warehouse Fire  Management,"fire is a primary threat to property and human safety in warehouses, and risk management of warehouse fires is challenging due to potential accident causes and various safety measures. warehouse fires are caused by many factors such as the size of the buildings and the amount of stored combustible material. the size of the buildings and the volumes of combustible material held result in many of the fires becoming major conflagrations which pose challenges for fire and rescue services and result in significant property losses. storage fires, like those in fuel storage facilities, can quickly spread to surrounding products, generate a number of secondary fires, resulting in conditions where accidents are uncontrollable, and severely destroy assets. the bowtie analysis approach was used in this paper for the industrial warehouse fire scenario. a generalized framework to manage warehouse fires was then developed followed by a general mitigation measure to control fires at industrial warehouses. a successful fire safety strategy is a thorough fire risk assessment that considers warehouse protection and life safety in compliance with national fire safety legislation. in the interests of developing a successful risk control program, an assessment will identify the fire threats and the potential for property losses and business interruption losses. the assessment should consider the structure of the building and the flammability of the products stored and the mode of storage.","fire hazards, bow-tie analysis, framework","In conclusion, the bow tie analysis approach is a powerful tool that gives a holistic approach to present a hazard assessment integrated with anticipated threats and potential consequences with their barriers and safety controls. In this study, the bow-tie analysis was used to assess the fire at warehouse scenario followed by a generalized framework that provides a systematic approach to fire hazards in warehouses. Finally, a generalized mitigation measure to control fire at the warehouse was further discussed. This technique has proved its effectiveness in many applications. Although case scenarios of fire are limited in literature, a more optimistic view on using this approach to control fire in industrial facilities is proposed.","areej bin amro and mariam al hammadi department of engineering health, safety and environment khalifa university for science and technology abu dhabi, uae 100042689@ku.ac.ae , 100050174@ku.ac.ae saed amer senior lecturer at the department of industrial and systems engineering khalifa university for science and technology abu dhabi, uae saed.amer@ku.ac.ae",

Therefore, the establishment of a strategy for handling solid waste is becoming more pertinent. The comprehensive framework developed in this work emphasized the efficient implementation of various waste processing technologies that were implemented in response to the COVID issue. It also illustrated the eﬀective management of various types of medical solid waste. One pitfall is that the SVM model is more expensive than other technologies as it needs advanced computational resources. In spite of the current COVID-19 pandemic, this study addresses waste management strategies that can be used to cut down on waste production. Light is also shed on prospective waste management scenarios for future pandemics.","aisha ali dhaiban, areej bin amro, haleema mohamed chulliyil samah elmuatasim ahmed, and saed t. amer khalifa university of science and technology 100042637@ku.ac.ae, 100042689@ku.ac.ae 100060994@ku.ac.ae, 100060551@ku.ac.ae saed.amer@ku.ac.ae",
109,The Physical And Mental Effects Of Working In A Hybrid  Work Environment On An Employee’S,"a hybrid work environment enables employees to have a combination of working from home and the office. the intention of this paper is to investigate and provide a comparison between hybrid work and in-office work environments. as researchers indicate, wfh has a positive impact on employee productivity and well-being. in order to provide a deep understanding, an empirical survey was conducted on 95 united emirates workers. the key findings of this survey illustrate that wfh has both positive and negative impacts on workers. the participants record positive experiences with wfh, including flexibility, increased efficiency, improved work-life balance, and better focus. however, the study revealed that some participants recorded various challenges, such as lack of social interaction, increased output expectations, and long working hours, which were obstructions to their participation in wfh. the findings from this research aid in understanding the benefits and challenges of wfh and inform organizations on the best approach to follow when instituting a hybrid work environment within their workforce.",hybrid work,"Recently, the world experienced a situation where they had to find another way to work within their houses. Businesses were closed for weeks until they prepared applications to overcome the loss and continue their productivity. Working from home was the only solution at that time and many facilities were capable of performing their daily tasks gradually till the end of the pandemic. The results of working from home were surprising as many businesses developed financially, in addition to increased employee productivity and satisfaction level. Nowadays, some facilities offer a hybrid work environment strategy, as it provides more flexibility, and increases employee performance and well-being. In addition, employees experience fewer distractions and stress-triggering factors in a hybrid work environment. This study suggested several methods to enhance employee well-being for UAE employees. The results showed that working from home does not differ from the office work environment, considering their task load and work shifts. In fact, 58% agreed that they perform better with higher productivity than in the office work environment due to the absence of interruptions and other office distractions by 84%. Although communication among work colleagues was lower, 95% of the participants preferred working from home as they benefit from transportation time and organize their breaks with lower management supervision. To conclude, a Hybrid work environment offers many benefits for employees and employers as work can be continued and tasks can be performed while workers are enjoying their cups of coffee inside their homes. 1164","well-being and performance jwahir albreiki, aisha dhaiban, maryam alkatheeri and noora b. almansoori health, safety and environment engineering department of industrial and systems engineering khalifa university abu dhabi, united arab emirates jwmalbreiki@ku.ac.ae,100042637@ku.ac.ae, 100044614@ku.ac.ae, nobalmansoori@ku.ac.ae dr. saed amer faculty member industrial and systems engineering department - khalifa university abu dhabi, united arab emirates saed.amer@ku.ac.ae","References

110,"Human Failure Due To Stress  Amal Almarzooqi, Saed T. Amer, Arwa Alzubaidi,","stress has been considered a major negative impact on employees worldwide. the present century is known as the stress era since human life is full of stress and strain. workers know how their anxiety and stress levels impact their capacity for productivity. the main reason for stress presence is the complexity of the human personal, social, and ecological environment, and simultaneously interactions of humans with its surrounding. in terms of psychological sciences, stress is a feeling of mental tension. low levels of stress are more desirable, and even healthy, and facilitate human performance. however, high levels of stress result in social, psychological, biological problems, and serious harm to people. this project shows innumerable studies in this field investigated the role of different related factors of stress and aimed to aggregate various dimensions of theoretical issues and influences of stress in human everyday life especially in work. also, this project introduces multiple devices for stress measurement and how they are conducted to employees in order to measure their stress levels. a conducted survey done with 30 engineers working at npcc, the results have shown different levels of stress on conducted employees. however, the present study was an effort to make a theoretical unity of different measurement devices. according to the obtained results and data, stress can’t be investigated and observed via a single study, therefore, incorporation is much needed by psychologists to analyze and develop future frameworks for minimizing and controlling work-related stress.","stress, strain","Stress at work has a complicated relationship with human error, memory loss, and decision-making. It can have a detrimental influence on a person's capacity to carry out activities and make judgments. High amounts of stress can affect cognitive abilities such as memory, attention, and decision-making, which increase the likelihood of mistakes and errors. When someone is under stress, they could be more prone to neglect crucial information, make mistakes, or forget vital data, resulting in mistakes and failures. Stress from the workplace also affects one's ability to make decisions. When under stress, a person could be more inclined to act quickly or rely on inaccurate information than to take the time to properly weigh all of their options and decide what to do. Human memory impairment can also have an impact on judgment. A person may be more prone to make the same mistakes in the future if they have previously failed or made blunders, especially if they are stressed out or under pressure to achieve. Overall, work-related stress, human error, memory loss, and poor decision- making are all connected and can significantly influence productivity and job performance. It is crucial for people and organizations to be aware of how stress may affect these variables and to take actions to control stress levels and reduce the likelihood of mistakes and failures.","and noora alhosani department of industrial and systems engineering khalifa university abu dhabi, united arab emirates amal.mohd.1995@outlook.com, saed.amer@ku.ac.ae, arwaalzubaidi@gmail.com, 100040035@ku.ac.ae",
111,"Quality, The Configuration Of The Inspection System  And Resource Requirements","resource requirements is the basic building block of capacity planning and a principal concern in the design of production/manufacturing system. similar factors govern resource requirements and material flows. in particular, quality factors and the configuration of the quality assurance – the inspections' system. in ieom 2021, the dependencies of material flows on quality and the configuration of the inspection system have been discussed and resource requirements have been marked for future consideration. now it is their turn. despite the intensive effort devoted to this subject, only recently have the dependencies of resource requirements on quality levels and the configuration of the inspections' system been modeled correctly. the quality levels, the configuration of the inspections' system, and inspection error rates significantly affect production volumes and the consequent resource requirements. due to the compensation principle volume and hence resource requirements are inversely related to the quality level - increase with the defect rates. inspections aid by removing defect units – decrease the volumes. unfortunately, inspections are imperfect and conforming units are also removed due to inspection errors. these units, too, require compensations. besides, inspections incur costs, additional to other production costs. consequently, the configuration of the inspections' system becomes an issue. these effects are demonstrated, examined and discussed in this talk.","(12 font) quality, inspection errors, yield rates",,"moshe eben-chaime department of industrial engineering & management ben gurion university of the negev be'er sheva, israel even@bgu.ac.il",
112,A Novel Integer Programming Model For The Fixture  Schedule Of Turkish Professional Soccer League,"we study a sports scheduling problem where the entire fixture of a soccer season in turkey must be scheduled by taking into account a variety of constraints. we model the problem as an integer program; because of the computational intractability, we develop a heuristic algorithm for obtaining a suboptimal solution. differing from the earlier models, our model minimizes the assignment of matches where a team plays against strong teams consecutively. we compare the performance of our heuristic against the existing solution and demonstrate numerically that our heuristic performs significantly better than the current solution.","or in sports, sports scheduling, scheduling","The problem of scheduling the fixture is computationally intractable in terms of optimality objective. In this research, we tackle the fixture schedule problem for Turkish professional soccer league by using the notion of strength criteria and utilizing an easy-to-use heuristic procedure. Particularly, the idea that teams can be classified based on their strength enables us to have a mathematical model for obtaining a near-optimal solution. Our numerical results are promising, showing the strength of our heuristic algorithm as compared to the current solution. This implies that such a heuristic based on a simplified mathematical model can be used for obtaining a better solution in terms of strength criterion. We are of the view that computational intractability of fixture schedule problems may be addressed through a variety of criteria that are similar to the strength criterion we proposed. In that case, it would be interesting to observe how distinct heuristic algorithms perform if multiple types of criteria are considered.","yasin göçgün associate professor of industrial engineering department of industrial engineering istanbul medipol university istanbul, turkey",
113,3D-Printing Impacts On Türkiye’S Defense Industry:   A Swot-Based Approach,"every nation aspires to have a capable national defense that is backed by a robust national defense industry. one of the most important expectations is that the defense industry, like every other sector, should make maximum use of technology for establishing an independent national defense. 3d printing as an emerging technology is widely used in many sectors including mari-time, aerospace, and automotive. it should come as no surprise then, that it is also being increasingly adopted by the defense sector worldwide. this study focuses on the effects of 3d printing technology on türkiye’s defense in-dustry. for this purpose, a three-stage methodology was followed. in the first stage, the positive and negative effects of 3d printers on the defense indus-try were determined via literature. in the second stage, the swot analysis of türkiye's defense industry was examined. in the last stage, the effects of 3d printers on the outputs obtained at the end of swot were carried out. the opinions needed during the study were obtained from defense industry companies in türkiye and academicians working in this field.","defense industry, 3d printing","There are reasons for the rapid popularization of additive manufacturing tech-nologies in the defense industry. With a 3D printer, the problems posed by the supply chain are largely solved. With additive manufacturing, products can be personalized according to needs. In this way, weapons and vehicles that do not produce spare parts can remain in service longer, and long and costly processes such as designing UAVs according to mission characteristics can be eliminated. Especially in cross-border operations, carrying inventory brings along logistics problems. Additive manufacturing technologies allow the dimensions and weight of the transported material to be significantly reduced in this area, and enable solutions that were not possible before. In order to analyze these effects of 3D printers on the defense industry and more, SWOT analysis has been made. SWOT analysis is a strategic technique used to determine the strengths and weaknesses of the effects, and to determine the opportunities and threats arising from the internal and external environment. After this study, analyzes can be made using different multi-criteria decision making methods. 1229","nur sena ertem, gizem gunaydin and eren ozceylan department of industrial engineering, engineering faculty, gaziantep university, gaziantep, turkiye senayagbasan237@gmail.com, gizem.gunaydin44@gmail.com, erenozceylan@gmail.com","References

117,Pandemic Impact On Residential Electricity Customer   Load Profile Clustering,"this study focuses on analyzing customer load profiles and their impact on the electric distribution grid in the context of the covid-19 pandemic in the philippines. with the increasing number of filipinos working from home, energy consumption has surged, making it crucial for electric distribution companies to classify customer profiles based on energy usage. in this paper, we collected residential data from a philippine electric distribution company during the covid-19 pandemic. the objective is to employ clustering methods, particularly the k-means algorithm, to group customer profiles and determine the optimal number of clusters using the multi-criteria model and elbow method. all simulation were performed using matlab platform. this study provides valuable insights for electric distribution companies in managing customer load profiles and optimizing the distribution grid amidst the pandemic.","clustering, elbow method, k-means","This paper focuses on the clustering of customers' electricity load profiles using the K-means algorithm. A dataset of approximately 1 million customers was collected from a distribution company in the Philippines. The study utilized the Multi-Criteria Model and Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters, resulting in 2 and 7 clusters, respectively. The Multi-Criteria Model revealed two distinct peaks in the load profiles: Cluster 1 exhibited higher activity in the morning (8am) and afternoon (5pm), while Cluster 2 showed higher activity in the morning (8am) and evening (12mn). On the other hand, the Elbow Method identified 7 clusters, with Clusters 1-5 demonstrating similar consumption patterns with higher activity at nighttime (8pm-1am) and lower consumption during the afternoon (12nn-4pm and 6pm-7pm). Clusters 6-7 exhibited relatively flat consumption patterns. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on customer load profiles. The analysis of load profiles during the pandemic period revealed shifts in consumption patterns and changes in overall energy demand. These changes can be attributed to various factors such as remote work arrangements, lifestyle adjustments, and shifts in commercial activities. In addition, the pandemic highlighted the importance of adapting load profile clustering techniques to capture and analyze the evolving consumption patterns during exceptional circumstances. Electric distribution companies should consider incorporating temporal and contextual factors into their clustering models to accurately reflect the changes in customer behavior during such events. Moreover, The study underscores the importance of building resilience and flexibility into the electric grid infrastructure. Understanding the changes in load profiles can help companies better anticipate and manage shifts in energy demand. This can inform decisions related to capacity planning, network upgrades, and resource allocation to ensure reliable and efficient energy supply during challenging times. Finally, the pandemic serves as a learning opportunity for electric distribution companies to enhance their preparedness for future crises or disruptive events. By leveraging advanced clustering algorithms, real-time data analytics, and scenario modeling, companies can develop strategies to mitigate the impact of similar situations in the future, ensuring the resilience and reliability of the energy system. These findings provide valuable insights for electric distribution companies, enabling them to establish rules and strategies related to demand response, network planning, and load forecasting. For future research, it is recommended to explore the combination of the K-means algorithm with Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) for analyzing customer load profiles in time series data. Additionally, incorporating meta-heuristic optimization techniques such as Genetic Algorithm (GA) could enhance the K-means algorithm's ability to determine the optimal number of clusters.","maricar m. navarro industrial engineering department technological institute of the philippines cubao, quezon city mnavarro.ie@tip.edu.ph bryan b. navarro electrical engineering department technological institute of the philippines cubao, quezon city bryan.navarro@tip.edu.ph",

The strategy's ability to generate profitable trades and capture favorable market movements suggests its potential value as a technical analysis tool for investors in the Philippine stock market. The new window settings of MACD, (4, 22,3), have shown promising results in terms of performance and profitability. The alternative window lengths may provide traders with additional insights and trading opportunities, offering an alternative approach to utilizing the MACD indicator in the Philippine stock market. The MACD strategy, regardless of the specific settings used, appears to be particularly effective in capturing bullish trends and identifying potential buying opportunities. The strategy's ability to generate bullish crossovers and signal upward price movements can be valuable for investors seeking to capitalize on positive market conditions. Risk management is a crucial aspect of successful trading, and the MACD strategy can contribute to risk mitigation. By incorporating MACD-based signals, traders can potentially identify potential trend reversals, divergence patterns, or bearish crossovers, allowing for timely exits or risk management measures to protect against potential losses. 1285","a 12-year review maricar m. navarro industrial engineering department technological institute of the philippines cubao, quezon city mnavarro.ie@tip.edu.ph bryan b. navarro electrical engineering department technological institute of the philippines cubao, quezon city bryan.navarro@tip.edu.ph","References

reputation and profitability, the incorporation of sustainable-oriented practices and ESG considerations has become 
imperative. The alignment of business strategies with ESG principles allows companies to enhance their brand value, 
attract consumers who prioritize sustainability, and unlock long-term financial opportunities. Moreover, for investors, 
assessing a company's ESG performance has become essential in evaluating the potential for sustainable growth and 
maximizing investment returns. 
To reach the goal, the advanced model that grounded on cross-efficiency data envelopment analysis (CE-DEA) and 
considered both ESG-related indicator and financial descriptors is introduced. The model, examined by real cases, is 
a promising alternative for portfolio selection. The policy makers can consider the potential implications and formulate

Taiwan, which was primarily known for labor-intensive light industries and export processing industries in its early 
stages, after undergoing a transformation, it has gained significant recognition for its thriving electronics and 
technology industry. Taiwan's technological prowess in the industry has garnered international attention. According 
to TN Choice (2021), Taiwan's model, mainly focused on wafer foundry manufacturing, differs from the global 
semiconductor industry structure, which has contributed to Taiwan's unique competitive advantage. In 2017, the 
production value structure of Taiwan's semiconductor industry chain consisted of wafer foundry manufacturing 
accounting for 49%, IC design industry accounting for 25.1%, IC packaging and testing industry accounting for 19.4%, 
and memory industry accounting for 6.5%. The total production value reached $81 billion, ranking third globally, just 
behind the United States and South Korea. Taiwan holds the highest market share in the wafer foundry sector, 
occupying over 70% of the global market and generating a production value of $39.7 billion, it was an impressive 
achievement. Moreover, Chang (2009) found that 68.1% of high-tech industries in Taiwan are in accordance with 
business ethics and norms of conduct. Based on the aforementioned points, it is evident that the electronics and 
technology industry in Taiwan is an excellent subject of discussion. Furthermore, the European commission proposed 
the Net-Zero industry act in 2023. It forces the company who want to do business with E.U.-based companies need to 
reach the “Net-Zero” requirement (Zheng et al. 2023). Thus, the sustainability-related indicator (i.e. ESG) must to be 
taken into consideration for portfolio selection (Hu et al. 2023; Wang et al. 2023).  
In the past, most studies merely take the financial descriptors, such as returns on assets (ROA), sales growth rate, and 
earnings per share (EPS) as a core element to determine their investment portfolio (Chang  2009; Wang et al. 2023). 
However, recent researches has witnessed that the target selection for investment which neglects the sustainability-
related indicators has higher change to reach investment failure. To navigate the investors to formulate a trustful and

124,Stochastic Cost Modeling For Operator Allocation And  Workstation Planning In Manufacturing: Optimizing,"this paper presents the development of a stochastic cost model aimed at determining the optimal number of operators required for a workstation, considering the activities performed by them, the time required for each activity, and the associated costs. the model takes into account the inherent variability in task performance and the corresponding costs involved. by utilizing the derived time equations, the study identifies both value-added and non-value-added activities, along with their respective costs. the proposed optimization model not only enables the estimation of the required number of operators but also provides insights into the impact of addition of workstation on the overall cost of the product. by considering the variability in task performance and associated costs, the model offers a comprehensive approach to operator allocation and workstation planning. through the application of this stochastic cost model, organizations can make informed decisions regarding operator allocation, optimizing the utilization of available resources while minimizing costs. the findings of this research contribute to the understanding of the relationship between operator allocation, number of workstation, and production costs. the developed model serves as a valuable tool for decision-makers in the manufacturing industry, enabling them to analyze and optimize their operations effectively.","stochastic, cost management, variability, optimization","It is evident that there exist huge variations in the demand from the customer. So based on that changes it is required to adjust the allocation of the resources accordingly. Over allocation or under allocation of the resources can have a huge impact on the production abilities and eventually on the profitability of the company. To avoid these situations, it is very important to design this allocation of resources carefully. But for allocation of resources, it is important to understand how much time is spent on each activity and variability that comes along and the calculation of the cost. In this paper, the optimization of resource allocation was divided into two parts namely Operators and Equipment of Workstation. Using the time equations, the variability in the operator tasks were measured and costs were calculated. As the assembly line had the target cycle time, it was necessary that the total time spent by the operator should be less than the bottleneck or target cycle time. By using the traditional linear programming resource allocation problem to obtain the optimum number of operators required and best possible workstations that should be allocated to them was decided. With the equations developed it was possible to understand the activities performed by operator which were value added and non-value added to the product. So, it was possible to bifurcate between them and calculate the cost for it to clearly understand how much it costs for value added activities and non-value-added activities along with the inclusion of the variability. Based on the target cycle time it is possible to calculate the number of equipment needed in order to achieve that target. Following that, various iterations were performed to find a balance between the cost and adding an equipment to the workstation, as adding an equipment had direct effect in the increase of the cost of the product. But in some cases, adding the equipment was advantageous as the waiting time for other workstations decreased along with the bottleneck of the assembly line. Therefore, the cost component of bottleneck decreased (might as well change to some other workstation) which compensated the increased cost tariff, so the cost of the product was reduced. But it is not always the case, as it was observed in table 6 that when the extra equipment was added it didn’t have much effect on the bottleneck, so the cost of bottleneck component didn’t reduce much but the tariff cost increased a lot which resulted into significant increase in the final cost of the product. Hence, it can be concluded that using this methodology in order to calculate value added time and non-value added time of the operator along with the information about the optimum number of operators needed and their allocation of the workstation will help a lot to take some managerial decisions as they will have clear picture about the cost and focus can be then shifted on the optimization of the non-value added activities. Also, in terms of decision making for the designing of the line this approach can be helpful to understand better the effect on the cost of the product by adding the equipment to the workstation.

126,Optimizing Preventive Maintenance Frequency And  Duration Using Mathematical Model And,"maintenance planning is one of the most important tasks carried out by a factory. preventive maintenance is one type of maintenance that prevents major breakdowns from occurring. increasing preventive maintenance duration reduces corrective maintenance duration. however, conduction of preventive maintenance causes downtime and incurs costs too. several studies have been conducted to establish a tradeoff between these two types of maintenance to reduce the overall downtime. models that minimize costs are preferred by industries. besides, models requiring complex datasets are not readily adopted by most of the industries for regular use. this paper represents three different methods for optimizing preventive maintenance duration and frequency in a renowned flour mill factory of bangladesh. the first method uses an established mathematical model which determines the optimum frequency of preventive maintenance per month, maximizing profit. this model is comparatively easier to adopt in flour mills since it does not use reliability concepts for different components, rather uses simple costs and downtime data, assuming constant failure rate. the second method modifies the existing model to optimize the duration of each pm inspection as well as frequency, which is an important parameter for flour mill maintenance. the third method uses three maintenance kpis as inputs to determine the total duration of pm per month for the flour mills. the reason for not adopting pm models in factories is the lack of data availability and the difficulty in aligning the model with the existing maintenance plan. besides, flour mills have components in continuous production lines which, if maintained separately, would not be profitable, rather a single pm activity should be carried out for some set hours, set by the maintenance department. the rationale behind this paper is to develop easily adaptable pm models for flour mills.","optimization, flour mill, maintenance","The flour mill factory can save a large amount of profit y reducing the mean preventive maintenance time to an optimal value by implementing the modified model, using two KPIs. They can also determine the overall preventive maintenance duration to be maintained for the following month, for a mill using current KPIs values as inputs in fuzzy model. As factories tend to implement models which are cost effective, the modified inspection model can be a well suit in industries. By implementing this model, they can maximize the profit considering all the variables necessary for the profit calculation. Besides, they can implement current constraints in their model which will give them an appropriate output aligned with the factory. Some of the Future works can include, determining optimal KPI values for individual components of a flour mill. The maintenance departments set KPI values. However, techniques for determining their optimum values can be developed. Another scope for future work can be using other KPIs for fuzzy inputs rather than the major three ones. The flour mill factories can optimize preventive maintenance frequency and duration by using the modified inspection model and the fuzzy logic-based model. Also, factories who maintain a maximum downtime percentage and minimum mean preventive maintenance time, can also implement this model in their factories. 1386","fuzzy logic in flour mills lubna jahan joty and md. abul hasan b.sc. in industrial & production engineering bangladesh university of engineering & technology dhaka, bangladesh lubnaipe@gmail.com, abulhasan2892@gmail.com dr. sultana parveen professor in industrial & production engineering bangladesh university of engineering & technology dhaka, bangladesh sparveen@ipe.buet.ac.bd","References

130,The Role And Benefits Of Business Process Simulation In  Digital Transformation Process Within Banking Sector,"banks play vital role in the economy because they manage investments for both individuals and corporations, operate the payment system, and provide credit. previously, the banking sector was more focused on face-to-face interactions with customers to conduct business. business process simulation is an essential business process management technique that analyses business processes and validates process improvement. according to the contingency theory, the banks’ new digital focus must be aligned with business processes for them to function effectively. as one of the largest banks in south africa, absa bank has embraced the use of digital platforms for customers and digitized most business processes to offer clients effective services or products. there is a need to align and understand the role that business process simulation plays in business processes to enable digital transformation in the banking sector. the purpose of this study is to investigate and understand the role of business process simulation in enabling the effective digital business transformation in the banking sector - a case study of absa bank limited. an online survey questionnaire method was developed and distributed amongst absa employees for data collection.","digitization, banking sector","Due to digital advancements in the financial business market, financial sectors are currently digitalizing most processes to digitally transform and align in the current business market. This paper investigated the position and objectives of business process simulation in enabling digital transformation in financial sector. This paper highlights the benefits of business process simulation in enabling digital transformation. Cost avoidance is one of these advantages because businesses can simulate the solution for the future state and make financial decisions based on the simulation results. Business will be able to see the solution in action before it is designed and decide on the best digital platform that will fit the operational process and customer expectations thanks to business process simulation, which improves agility, speed, and data-driven decision-making through digital transformation. Business process simulation can provide the engineers or business with a view of whether their design will be fit for digital transformation strategy or purpose and would also provide a view of how the systems would perform provided different scenarios in real world.","case of absa bank limited mayver ramogayane design team – process engineering design process engineer absa bank limited johannesburg, south africa mayver.ramogayane@absa.africa zamokuhle pila design team – process engineering design senior process engineer absa bank limited johannesburg, south africa zamokuhle.pila@absa.africa rose seanego design team – process engineering design manager process engineer absa bank limited johannesburg, south africa rose.seanego@absa.africa",
131,Experimental Finalization Of Levels Of Predictor Variables  For Accelerated Degradation Testing Of Cutting Tools,"during accelerated degradation testing (adt), the component is exposed to higher levels of parameters that cause it to fail faster than it would under normal operating conditions. this approach saves time and reduces expenses associated with tool life tests for valuable workpieces. the fundamental assumption of adt is that failure modes observed at elevated levels of parameters are similar to those under recommended usage conditions. in this study, tool failure modes are utilized to determine the appropriate levels of predictor variables, like cutting parameters and tool nose radius, for adt of pvd-coated carbide tools during dry machining of inconel 800. to study tool failure modes, experiments are done at three levels of cutting speed (vc), feed rate (f), depth of cut (ap), and nose radius (r) by following the taguchi l9 orthogonal array. notably, a favourable tool failure pattern is observed when employing the middle level of the nose radius and operating at relatively higher cutting speeds while ensuring that f and ap fall within the recommended range. in the future, with the parameters’ levels established through this study, full-scale adt will be performed and extrapolated to predict the reliability function of the cutting tool under normal conditions. the suggested method holds potential for various applications, including estimating the reliability of cutting tools and monitoring tool condition, among others.","inconel 800, pvd-coated carbide, adt, cost","This study focuses on high-speed machining of Inconel 800 using PVD-coated carbide tools, with a particular emphasis on observing tool failure modes to identify the levels of parameters that result in a desirable tool wear pattern, specifically flank wear. The experimental results demonstrate that maintaining the feed rate and depth of cut within the manufacturer's recommended range increases the likelihood of flank wear on the cutting tool when cutting at speeds significantly higher than the recommended range, using a middle-level nose radius. Given the challenges associated with machining Inconel 800, this experimental study provides valuable insights into determining the levels of machining parameters suitable for accelerated degradation testing (ADT) and identifying the geometric features, such as the nose radius, of the cutting tool to be utilized during ADT. In the future, full-scale accelerated degradation testing (ADT) will be conducted using the levels of cutting parameters finalized in this study to obtain degradation data. Subsequently, this data will be utilized to extrapolate and estimate the reliability of the cutting tool under normal operating conditions.","monojit das and v. n. achutha naikan subir chowdhury school of quality and reliability indian institute of technology kharagpur kharagpur, india monojitdasjgec@kgpian.iitkgp.ac.in, naikan@hijli.iitkgp.ac.in subhash chandra panja department of mechanical engineering jadavpur university kolkata, india subhash.panja@jadavpuruniversity.in",

The existence of a quality management department of the company and named for the civil contribution since the establishment of its factories . 2. The Ahlia Cement Company includes six factories, namely : Mergep Cement factory . Souq Alkames factory _ Amsehel (cement and lime). Lebda factory. Zliten cement factory . Msellath Bags . Algebs factory (ber ganem ) 3. The reasons of establishing a quality Department in factories is to achieve the goals that set by senior management, as well as believing in the role of quality management in factories to support the rest of the departments . 4. Quality Management factories do not have a major role in the development of plans and strategies. 5. Most of the factories obtain the global certificate of ISO quality system, which is one of the targets the factories sought to obtain. 6. The Recommendations that are placed by the Quality Management were only taken some of which, according to the desire of the staff. 7. Quality Management check and monitor its operations and procedures in the implementation of departmental operations and plans. 8. The Quality Management does not take part in taking decisions. 9. Alburge factory, the largest cement producer in Libya does not have a department for Quality Management and there are no reasons for a rejection of the establishment, but on the contrary, urged the administration that there should be a special section of quality and that the separation of powers between the departments and the regularity of the workflow in addition to that there will be an incentive to compete for R & D with other factories. 10. The existence of laws and regulations stipulates that the existence of quality management and industrial enterprises but they are not working out and refer to it. 11. The proportion of staff in the Ministry of Industry Department who did not receive quality training courses 67%. 5.2 Recommendations Based on the conclusions of the research, some recommendations for future work can be summarized as following: 1. More concentration on training courses and qualification programs to include staff and heads of departments . 2. Supporting quality management by all means and involving them in decision-making . 3.

133,Re-Engineering Arnis Sticks Bag For Ctu-Mc Martial  Artists Using Design Thinking Principle,"this study aimed to evaluate the old and new designs of the arnis sticks bag and identify areas of improvement. the investigation was conducted in two phases, utilizing qualitative and quantitative methods. findings from the one- tailed independent samples t-test showed a significant difference between the performance of old and new designs of the arnis sticks bag under the considered fea criteria. the heuristics evaluation results also indicated that the new design was well-organized, consistent, comfortable, durable, secure, and satisfying. the kano model analysis identified several features that provide customer satisfaction and dissatisfaction. specifically, results showed that users like having and dislike not having compartment padding, cover, strap padding, and adjustable strap in the arnis stick bag. however, attractive features like the expandable compartments, durable material, modern aesthetics, hanging loop, and buckle lock were not required but are highly appreciated. based on the findings, the study recommended reducing complexity and improving the ease of use of the arnis sticks bag. incorporating features also classified as performance and continuously improving attractive features can add value to the product. ultimately, the study provides valuable insights for future designers and researchers to improve the design of arnis stick bags.","arnis sticks bag, kano analysis","Based on the findings presented, it can be concluded that the new design of the Arnis sticks bag is significantly different from the old design and has been well-received by users. The heuristics evaluation results show that the product meets the criteria for usability and user satisfaction. Additionally, the Kano model analysis provides insight into the features that are important to users, with some features providing satisfaction when present and not causing dissatisfaction when absent, while others are performance features that provide satisfaction when present and dissatisfaction when absent. No feature was identified as a reverse feature, and some features were indifferent. The analysis also highlights a potential issue with the padding of the compartment, which received a low quality level score. Overall, the findings suggest that the new design of the Arnis sticks bag has the potential to improve the user experience, although some improvements may be necessary to optimize certain features.","john cadogdog, honey bella libor, shiela mae quiñanola, and john angelo yanong industrial engineering student cebu technological university – main campus cebu city, 6000, philippines cadogdogjohn@gmail.com, liborhoneybella3@gmail.com, shielamaequinanola@gmail.com, yanongjohnangelo@gmail.com dyanne brendalyn cavero chairperson of the industrial engineering department cebu technological university – main campus cebu city, 6000, philippines dyannebrendalyn.cavero@ctu.edu.ph jerpri medillo instructor of the industrial engineering department cebu technological university – main campus cebu city, 6000, philippines jerpri.medillo@ctu.edu.ph",
134,"First-Come, First-Serve? Gig Worker Performance  And Task Allocation In An On-Demand Platform","on-demand platforms operating on a gig-contractor model rely on self-scheduling gig workers to meet real- time demand, while maintaining desired levels of productivity and service quality. such platforms usually allocate gig workers to tasks on a first-come-first-serve basis, which is often inefficient. this paper seeks to investigate whether allocation of workers to tasks based on prior experience and task characteristics could act as an alternative to the fcfs method. since on-demand platforms frequently expand to new geographies where workers might not have prior experience, it is unlikely that allocating tasks to workers based on experience alone would significantly improve performance. we investigate whether recent experience can positively impact gig workers’ task performance, and thus be utilized as a ranking parameter in task allocations. utilizing data from an on-demand grocery platform, we first developed an econometric model to analyze gig workers’ task performance based on their same-day experience, while accounting for sample selection and endogeneity. we find that as same-day experience increases, task productivity and service quality improves, even after controlling for worker and task characteristics. we developed two task allocation algorithms to allocate tasks based on workers’ rank, and task characteristics. we calculate predicted improvements in performance from the new allocations.","gig worker, sample selection","This paper investigates how recent (same-day) and prior experience affect gig worker performance in on-demand platforms. We further examine the moderating effects of task batching, complexity, and worker discretion in complex tasks. Using data from a leading sharing platform in Italy, we estimate the effects using a two-stage Heckman model with IVs. We then developed two task allocation algorithms and found that allocating workers to tasks based on task complexity and customers’ prior purchase experience can lead to improvements in task productivity and service quality. Although gig-work platforms are omnipresent in the food and grocery retail industry, enough attention has not been paid towards how to best manage workers such that the task performance is maximized, but not at the expense of 1488","reeju guha phd .candidate, operations management ie business school, ie university madrid, spain reejuguha@student.ie.edu","References

135,Evaluating The Efficiency Of A Procurement Process At An  Institution Of Higher Learning,"the higher education sector spends a large percentage of the total revenue receipts on purchases of goods and services annually. it also faces multiple challenges with regards to its supply chain processes, such as deficiencies in implementation of internal controls relating to supply chain management and procurement. other challenges include ancient systems and technology inefficiencies. these inefficiencies in procurement processes affect major research activities by having long lead times for research equipment. the aim of the study is to evaluate the efficiency of a procurement process for research equipment by conducting a survey among the users of this process. a survey was conducted at the using a sample of 108 participants from institution’s faculties. it was found that there were various issues and inefficiencies in the procurement process and erp system such team responsiveness, order accuracy, time taken to prepare and approve requisition and asset registration time. the paper ends with propositions for improvement techniques to be utilized for further study and continuous improvement.","procurement, purchase order","In this study, the survey was done to ascertain inefficiencies in the procurement process of research equipment in an institution of higher learning. The extent of inefficiencies was categorized into two categories of satisfaction and time taken to complete task in the procurement process. Various issues were such as that the respondents didn’t not know the procurement team structure for purchase order tracking. Other issues were around time taken to prepare and approve the requisitions. Asset registration time was also an issue that was exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. It is therefore critical to develop solutions around this area as to ensure that the critical key performance areas of the team are easily accessed and improved. Continuous improvement techniques such as DMAIC and Lean Office tools are used to recommend potential solutions for issues identified in the study. The recommendations also touch on the use of 4IR digitalization enablers such as big data, augmented reality and virtual reality. The implementation of the recommendations is expected to improve the supply chain efficiency and issues around the ERP system. The results of this research study, such as the dissatisfaction with the approval times, supplier payment delays and procurement team responsiveness, reveal that these problems identified, also occur in other HEIs in South Africa. This means that the universities must benchmark and align the processes have some uniformity across the higher education landscape and enabling knowledge sharing on processes, thus improving supply chain efficiency across the sector. The next phase of this study is to check how the improvements over time, through the tracking of key performance indicators in regular intervals. The learnings can then be shared through further publications and be implemented across the higher education sector.","bongumenzi mncwango department of industrial engineering durban university of technology durban, south africa kemlall ramdass professor in industrial engineering university of south africa johannesburg, south africa",

137,Assessment Centre For Quality Related Position  Sara Ait Bahom,"organizational change is a challenge for any company seeking to improve performance in a competitive marketplace. a key factor for improving the performance of a company is the recruitment of competent employees. in 2020, and more specifically since the coronavirus crisis, the whole world has begun to move towards remote working, whether individual or collective, due to its well-known advantages, such as reduced costs and working time. in this respect, for any company that wants to evaluate in a solid way the competences of candidates for the desired positions, with a reduction in costs and time, remote recruitment will be an ideal solution. in this article, we propose an assessment center model named assessment center qual position, that assess quality-related competences that enables companies to evaluate and select candidates remotely while dealing with the subjectivity of qualitative assessment. this approach is based on the assessment center model, the fuzzy 2-tuple representation model and the degree of similarity.","remote recruitment, assessment center, 2-tuple","In this article, we present a virtual Assessment Center designed to help companies remotely recruit the best competent candidates for quality-related positions while meeting the requirements of ISO 9001:2015.The Assessment Center developed is flexible, allowing the company to implement its tests and simulations by identifying the competences required for the desired positions. The approach based on the integration of the linguistic representation of the 2-tuple and the similarity index is used for the competence evaluation and the candidate selection. Indeed, this approach allows to deal with the subjectivity of qualitative nature of competence and the subjectivity of expert opinions. It also helps recruiters select the best candidate using the similarity index, which measures the existing similarity between the candidate's profile and the company's required profile. Moreover, the competence levels acquired by candidates, calculated as 2-tuple, give companies an idea of new employees' competence levels and plan appropriate training programs for them. For perspective, we will implement this Assessment Center QualPosition model in a company that wants to recruit a quality-related position.","department of information and communication systems laboratory national school for applied sciences tangier, morocco lotfi chraïbi department of information and communication systems laboratory national school for applied sciences tangier, morocco naoufal sefiani engineering, innovation management and industrial systems research team faculty of science and t tangier, morocco aitbahom.sara@gmail.com , lchraibi@uae.ac.ma, tsefiani@gmail.com",
138,Incorporating Micro Supply Chain In The Simulation Of The  Food-Energy-Water Nexus,"in this paper, an agent-based model is employed to study urban farm interconnectivity, with the goal of increasing food availability for the population and efficiently managing food, energy and water resources. urban farms are presented as a case study, that belong to community microgrids that generate electricity from renewables (solar, wind), in the province of chiriqui in panama, is utilized to investigate the food-energy-water (few) nexus. the idea of different farms serving different communities can be viable, however, sometimes there is a shortage of fresh food, or other times a surplus of fresh food, which leads to food wastage. food waste has the capability of being transformed into fertilizers or into biomass energy, however when we consider the associated natural resources and costs used to produce food, avoiding waste would be a better alternative. thus, it is crucial to investigate the food supply chain, and the interaction between different urban farms in a community shared agriculture fashion. an optimization model is employed to minimize food transportation cost between the farms within the agent-based framework. the results show that food availability is improved due to the exchange between farms while food wastage is reduced by 17,137kg. furthermore, the simulations show that the sharing of energy through the microgrid employing renewable energy is economical and significantly reduced carbon emissions by avoiding 13,078 tonnes of co2 and generating 16,560 mwh of electricity through solar, and 2,333 mwh of electricity through wind.","agent-based model, urban farms, micro supply chain",".

139,An Input-Output-Based Assessment Of The Global Food  Security Index,"with the ever-increasing effect of climate change worldwide and many problems like geopolitical issues, population boom, etc., more people are experiencing food insecurity, and many more are at risk. food security is a very complex topic, but many researchers have tried to arrive at a composite index to measure food security. one such widely used measure is global food security index. this research has employed a statistical approach named data envelopment analysis (dea) to analyze the global food security index in detail. the indicators used to arrive at the composite score, i.e., gfsi, are only input based, i.e., they consider the existing resources and facilities available which can help a country bolster food security in the country. in contrast to previous approaches, our study takes a different perspective by incorporating output indicators as a means to calculate the composite score for measuring food security in each country. specifically, we employ an output-based indicator, namely the prevalence of severe food insecurity in the population, expressed as a percentage of the total population. this indicator serves as a measure of the country's effectiveness in achieving food security. by focusing on output indicators, our methodology provides a unique and comprehensive assessment of food security, taking into account the actual outcomes and impacts experienced by the population. we ran a dea analysis on the gfsi scores for the 35 countries selected for 2017, 2018, and 2019. different weighting approaches, namely equal weight, expert-based weight, and dea-assigned weight, were also applied to arrive at the gfsi score. the results were further analyzed and compared to infer meaningful insights.","food security, sufficient","and Recommendation The research has employed a statistical approach to analyze the Global Food Security Index in detail. The indicators used to arrive at the composite score, i.e., GFSI, are only input based, i.e., they consider the existing resources and facilities available which can help a country bolster food security in the country. Still, they don’t consider output indicators to arrive at the composite score used to measure the food security in each country. We used an output-based indicator, i.e., the Prevalence of severe Food Insecurity in the population in terms of population percentage, to gauge the country's effectiveness in Food Security. We applied three different weighting approaches: Equal weight, expert- based weight, and DEA-assigned weight on the data to calculate the GFSI scores. Based on the statistical analysis performed, it was inferred that the countries at the bottom of the Global food Security Index rank list are the countries achieving the efficiency score of 1. Overall, the bottom-ranked countries of the GFSI rank list perform better than those at the top. The countries at the top of the GFSI rank have excess resources and facilities, which awards them the top position since the GFSI doesn’t account for any output indicators regarding food security. When we compared the performance of the countries not just with the input indicators but with the output indicator, i.e., Prevalence of severe Food Insecurity in population, then we found out that the countries at the bottom of the GFSI rank list despite fewer resources and facilities fared better than the countries at the top. If we analyze all the countries which achieved a DEA Efficiency score of 1 through the years 2017, 2018, and 2019 for different weighting cases, it is found that all of these countries are ranked below 20 of the total 35 countries in the list. Moreover, when we plotted and compared the DEA Efficiency score-based rank v/s GFSI rank, it was clear that the countries at the top in the GFSI rank are placed at the bottom in the DEA Efficiency score-based rank. Similarly, the countries at the bottom of the DEA Efficiency score-based rank are at the top of the GFSI rank list. For example, in 2017, countries like Brazil, Bulgaria, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru, Singapore, and Uruguay achieved an efficiency score of 1, but they have GFSI ranks of 31,32,35,33,27,30, and 29, respectively. The same phenomenon was repeated in 2018 and 2019 by GFSI bottom-placed countries by achieving an efficiency score of 1. Only a few exceptions have arrived where these countries remained in the same region in the rank list, like New Zealand, Greece, etc. However, it is important to note the nature of that DEA as it doesn’t consider the country's cultural, political, and comprehensive view to arriving at results like a human. So, while using the analysis results to frame policies, we must comprehensively view the country’s status and capabilities so we don’t arrive at wrong and ill-suited policies. The primary challenge associated with this research was the unavailability of data about the nutritional state of citizens of all the countries for a longer time frame. Nevertheless, it is an opportunity for future research. It works as an extension of this research to study the feasibility of statistical methods which can help countries find their weaknesses and achieve the highest efficiency possible along with a highly food-secured population. For future work, the author recommend to exted some of the advanced regression method in generating weight of the food security dimensions; see for Abdella 2021b. This would provide the decision-makers with small space of indicators the matter that help in clearly identify the oppurtunities of enahnacement for the food security performance.","hamad nabeel, muna alansari, galal m. abdella, adeeb a. kutty, and issa m. al mohannadi mechanical and industrial engineering department college of engineering, qatar university doha, qatar hn2110478@student.qu.edu.qa, 200356160@qu.edu.qa, gmg5005@qu.edu.qa, akutty@qu.edu.qa, ia2005586@qu.edu.qa",
140,Implementation Of The Value Stream Mapping 4.0   Method In A Warehouse,"warehouse digitalization promises new opportunities for businesses. by overseeing the entire line through the lean manufacturing tool vsm, solutions will be sought to optimize the process.","digitization, warehouse","The presented VSM 4.0 method is an extension of the well-known VSM method. VSM 4.0 focuses on redesigning a standard process from a Lean Manufacturing perspective, as well as processing all the necessary information for a value chain. One of the key benefits of using VSM 4.0 is the ability to monitor processes and quickly identify any inefficiencies or waste in real-time. This allows for quick adjustments to be made, leading to a more agile and responsive production process. In addition, the interconnectivity provided by the technologies 4.0 allows for greater collaboration and communication between machines, processes, and employees. Another important aspect of VSM 4.0 is the integration of Lean Manufacturing principles. This involves not only streamlining processes, but also reducing waste, optimizing resources, and improving quality. By combining the VSM methodology with the principles of Lean Manufacturing, companies can achieve a more efficient and effective value chain. The interconnection between machines, processes, and employees provided by 4.0 technologies makes the VSM tool capable of monitoring value flows in real-time to quickly address any potential waste, including machine setup delays and costs. Ultimately, the introduction of new technologies can help a company remain competitive in the market and adapt to rapid changes in the business environment. Although this may require significant initial investment, the long-term benefits may be worth it and allow the company to realize higher profits in the future. 1576","racha benmimoun phd researcher at industrial engineering laboratory university of mohamed premier oujda, morocco r.benmimoun@ump.ac.ma yosra el kihel professor and researcher at the university of bordeaux professor at the institut catholique d'arts et métiers bordeaux, france elkihel.yosra@gmail.com soufiane embarki an engineer-researcher at industrial engineering laboratory university of mohamed premier oujda, morocco s.embarki@ump.ac.ma bachir el kihel professor and researcher at the university of mohamed premier oujda, morocco belkihel@yahoo.fr","References

141,"30, 2023  Intelligent Quality Control In Cold Supply Chains","towards a sustainable and resilient digital cold supply chain, environment sensing technologies and big data analytics combined with artificial intelligence can extract critical information and provide a systematic framework for product optimization and safety enhancement. our research focuses on a descriptive analysis framework of a real-world dairy food distribution system, using historical data collected from embedded sensors inside refrigerated trucks. the dataset consists of 5,972 records that present the distribution schedule, the collected temperatures and the refrigerator’s open door window in seconds. the measurements are taken both on-route and while loading/unloading from various 1579",,"have been produced regarding dairy products distribution characteristics and temperature behaviour. Initially, as expected, in the summer period temperature fluctuations are intensified both on route and on the delivery points, and the operating time of the refrigerator is extended. Additionally, the refrigerators’ operation in the majority of the trucks has some periodic characteristics (operates until a specific temperature is achieved) resulting in continuous temperature changes. However, in the winter period, a specific track did not have any temperature fluctuations due to the fact that the refrigerator was turned off. Moreover, in some cases, it is observed, that while the mean temperature difference when on the route is relatively low the same variable on a delivery point has a relatively high value. In the aforementioned cases, the total number and duration a door is left open at a delivery point is extended verifying the correlation between mean temperature differences and open door frequency. Hence, it can be considered that this specific behaviour is triggered by a human factor and not by a refrigerator’s malfunction. On the other hand, some instances in the summer period were identified where temperature fluctuations were intense on average, both in motion and at a delivery point. This occurred even without the door being open for a particularly long time. Thus, this may be due to insufficient maintenance of the cooling unit or issues of insufficient thermal insulation of the vehicle. During the winter season, even if the doors remained open for a long period, temperature differences in the chamber were not particularly affected. Finally, some distributors had low-temperature deviations and optimal performance due to the efficient refrigeration unit and thermal insulation but also due to the efficient use of the doors by the human operator. 4. Conclusion A descriptive analysis and performance comparison in a digital cold supply chain environment is presented. The uprise of Cyber-Physical Systems, the Internet of Things, Big Data analysis, 5G technologies and Artificial intelligence enhance the implementation of smart decision support systems assessing the safety of dairy products and refrigeration efficiency during distribution. Following the system definition, a comprehensive framework of a data analysis approach combining data cleaning, data pre-processing, data visualization and result evaluation was developed enhancing the decision-making process. The results compared the efficiency performance of various delivery trucks during winter and summer periods and verified the excessive correlation between temperature differences and open door timelapse especially during the summer period. The future work of this research seeks to collect additional historical data containing deteriorated product measurements (measurements from products that do not have their organoleptic properties) in order to develop a predictive algorithm for product condition prediction and prescriptive approaches for system optimization and loss prevention. Another extension of this work is to enhance descriptive analysis focusing on dairy product temperature differences when on different crate positions inside the distribution 1584","panagiotis mallioris , dimitrios bechtsis department of industrial engineering and management international hellenic university thessaloniki, greece panmalliw@gmail.com, dimbec@ihu.gr dimitrios vlachos department of mechanical engineering, industrial management division, aristotle university of thessaloniki thessaloniki, greece vlachos1@auth.gr georgios papapanagiotakis , theodora todi r&d department emphasis digiworld athens, greece gpap@emphasisdw.com, dtodi@emphasisdw.com maria papaspyropoulou r&d department atlantis engineering thessaloniki, greece papaspyropoulou@atlantis-engineering.com konstantinos georgakidis r&d department mevgal thessaloniki, greece kgeorgakidis@mevgal.gr nikolaos sfitis r&d department makios logistics thessaloniki, greece nsfitis@makios.gr","References

145,2023.   Assessing Spatial Planning Readiness To Accommodate,"contemporary cities have taken up efforts to decarbonize urban mobility which has led to a growth in electric vehicles and investment in new renewable energy opportunities. the current transport sector contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, air pollution, and traffic congestion. this has led to a growth in studies to develop a reservoir of knowledge on sustainable mobility to address this challenge. the global shift towards electric vehicles has provided greater energy efficiency as part of the global climate change mitigation strategies, however, electric vehicles are not widely adopted in developing countries due to factors such as insufficient charging stations. globally this shift to electric vehicles and the spatial distribution of charging stations has been informed by the private sector. this has led to city authorities to be reactive to the implementation of electric vehicle and its charging infrastructure. there is hence a need to assess the readiness of spatial planning to facilitate the transition towards electric vehicles and its infrastructure. given this emerging trend in urban mobility transition, there have been lack of proactive policy initiatives to inform the adoption of electric vehicles. using a qualitative research approach this study unpacks the adoption of electric vehicles from urban spatial planning perspective. fifteen participants from the city of tshwane were interviewed using a semi-structured interview format. the participants were selected using snowball sampling and purposive sampling. content analysis was used to develop themes. findings of the study reveal areas where the charging infrastructure is placed, as these can be found in public spaces such as shopping malls and office parks in the city of tshwane. the implications of the study are creation of a reservoir on knowledge to inform plans for developing countries such as south africa to integrate spatial distribution of charging stations with sustainable mobility initiatives. future studies should develop a framework to inform the broader aspects of spatial planning in relation to innovative sustainable transport systems.","electric vehicle, spatial planning","This study has sought to examine the involvement of urban planners in the transition towards electric vehicles. Technological change in urban mobility has the potential to influence or change the urban form and the urban interactions. The link between the urban formation and the transition towards electric vehicles is often not recognized due to lack of research which is also worsened by lack of clear planning policies. The spatial formation can potentially facilitate the transition of new urban mobility systems by connecting the new urban infrastructures and urban interactions through the use of advanced public transport systems, furthermore, having spatial knowledge has the potential to inform urban planning policies to ensure that the city of Tshwane meets the objectives of being a sustainable and inclusive city. Sustainable transport systems form part of sustainable urban cities, the transition towards innovative transport systems must be clearly integrated with the objectives of the city of Tshwane being an inclusive and smart city. Through clear stakeholder engagement, new ways of thinking is required to respond to the emerging technology of electric vehicles, currently there is lack of coordination between various departments in the urban planning field which has the potential of resulting in poor planning for electric mobility. The private sector is emerging as the main actor facilitating the transition towards electric mobility. Since the technology of electric vehicles is still considered to be new, it is not yet clearly examined from a spatial form perspective. Urban planners are not yet prepared to respond to the emergence of electric vehicles and to respond to the potential spatial formation caused by these new innovative vehicles, furthermore, urban planners have unclear mandates in the transition towards electric mobility. The local government needs to have a clear understanding of this urban spatial transformation driven by smart city technologies to facilitate an inclusive and sustainable urban development. Proactive urban planning policies are required to manage the spatial patterns of electric mobility in a manner that is aligned with the objectives of sustainable urban planning and development. The findings of the study can foster strong collaboration between private companies and urban planners, while also providing support for the establishment of regulations. These regulations would ensure that the deployment of charging stations follows the principles of stakeholder engagement to co create new innovative regulations that foster inclusive distribution of technological advancement. Further research can build upon the findings of this study to identify and precisely articulate the challenges associated with the current urban planning approaches and policies promoting the progress of the electric vehicle deployment, furthermore, the spatial implications of introducing the electric vehicles should be clearly defined to inform the policymaking processes. 1031","innovative transport systems and technologies. desmond nkopodi mphahlele and trynos gumbo university of johannesburg, department of urban and regional planning, office 6062, sixth floor, john orr building, beit and siemert street, 2028. johannesburg, south africa mphahlelend@gmail.com, tgumbo@uj.ac.za thembani moyo centre for applied research innovation in the built environment (carinbe) university of johannesburg, department of construction management & quantity surveying, office 6166, sixth floor, john orr building, beit and siemert street, 2028. johannesburg, south africa tmoyo@uj.ac.za","References

148,Applying Six Sigma To Reduce Electricity Bill In  Single Family Residential Home,"this paper describes a case study of a single-family home to apply six sigma problem solving methods and tools to reduce the electricity bill and usage. the goal of the project was to identify and implement improvements that would reduce electricity usage and hence reducing electricity bill. the project team applied the six sigma dmaic (define, measure, analyze, improve, control) problem solving approach. six sigma is a framework to improve performance process or tasks. the author of the paper has been working on the topic over the past 1 year. the author was able to reduce the electricity bill by 50-60% by making some proper research and lifestyle change. the highest bill that was noted is $135 a month and lowest after performing the control measures came down to $57 a month.","six sigma, single family home, bill reduction","This electricity bill reduction project has been extremely successful in reducing the electricity bill in a single- family home and is already giving results by reducing the bill by 50% from the initial bills when they moved in single family home. This showed great results as a lean six sigma application solving problem. Household members first Identified project problem, measured and assessed the possible root causes, implemented the possible improvement solutions, and evaluated results in terms of bill amount reduction, applied control plan to continuously maintain the reduced billing amount. There were several critical elements in the improvement process like monitoring thermostat, using dynamic timing, utilizing smart appliances and weatherizing the home every season. Using less hot water also played a vital role in controlling the usage. Getting the smart thermostat for free was a great help in keeping the electricity usage low. The project would not have been successful if the family members were not attentive enough and keen on finding information and ways in reducing the usage. This case study exhibits that six sigma techniques can be used and implemented in everyday life also and eliminate waste. 5. Recommendation Electricity bill consisted of a good amount of the budget by making few lifestyle changes, some research and little investment this expense can be control affecting the monthly budget.","vidita shukla and ahad ali a. leon linton department of mechanical, robotics and industrial engineering lawrence technological university southfield, mi 48075, usa vshukla@ltu.edu",
149,Improved Dynamic Latent Variable Modeling For   Process Monitoring And Diagnosis,"due to the advancement of modern industrial processes, a considerable number of measured variables enhance the complexity of systems, progressively leading to the development of multivariate statistical analysis (msa) methods to exploit valuable information from the collected data for predictive modeling, fault detection and diagnosis, such as partial least squares (pls), canonical correlation analysis (cca) and their extensions. however, these methods suffer from some issues, involving the irrelevant information extracted by pls, and cca’s inability to exploit quality information. latent variable regression (lvr) was designed to address these issues, but it has not been fully and systematically studied. a concurrent kernel lvr (cklvr) with a regularization term is designed for collinear and nonlinear data to construct a full decomposition of the original nonlinear data space, and to provide comprehensive information of the systems. further, dynamics are inevitable in practical industrial processes, and thus a dynamic auto-regressive lvr (dalvr) is also proposed based on regularized lvr to capture dynamic variations in both process and quality data. the comprehensive monitoring framework and fault diagnosis and causal analysis scheme based on dalvr are developed. their superiority can be demonstrated with case studies, involving the tennessee eastman process, dow’s refining process and three-phase flow facility process.","nonlinearity, dynamics",,"haitian zhang phd candidate in the department of chemical engineering university of waterloo waterloo, canada haitian.zhang@uwaterloo.ca qinqin zhu assistant professor in the department of chemical engineering university of waterloo waterloo, canada ali elkamel full professor in the department of chemical engineering university of waterloo waterloo, canada aelkamel@uwaterloo.ca",

The paper identified, presented and discussed a number of competences required by change managers. Change managers play a significant role in assisting organizations to navigate through change. The study also looked at the education levels required for change managers as well as their field of study. It then looked into the years of experience that change managers need to have. This was done because education and years of experience have a considerable impact on the leadership skills necessary for change management. The analysis of job specifications might not give results that can be generalized beyond the South African context, but it allowed a rigorous process to identify and analyze the competences for change managers. This study made contributions to the research of change management by stimulating the debate and discussions. It also made contribution in the practice of change management, as well as providing concepts to be incorporated in teaching and learning. Future studies may focus on the quantitative surveys to solicit the views of change managers within their practice. It might also focus on doing the job analysis based the practical job one is doing on daily basis to manage change. Finally, the future studies may also look into the engineering sector to confirm if they rely on technical project managers for change management or if they understand the role of change management in change projects.

152,Analyzing The Benefits Of Incorporating Human   Factors In Socio-Technical Systems,"human factors engineering aims to optimize socio-technical systems to enhance systems performance and human well-being throughout the systems lifecycle. the aviation industry is one of the sophisticated and influential industries that popularized human factors engineering principles in response to aircraft incidents and accidents. now, there has been a slow pace in applying human factors in the lifecycle of socio-technical systems beyond the aviation industry. lack of understanding of human factors benefits has been alluded to as one of the factors that hinder the application of human factors in other industries. a number of studies focus on the development and application of various human factors models, but there seems to be no study that adequately shortlists, discusses and presents the benefits of applying human factors. the aim of this paper is to uncover, examine and classify the benefits of applying human factors engineering principles in sociotechnical systems, especially in the era of 4ir. a narrative literature review methodology was adopted to analyze and synthesize various conference and journal articles on the application of human factors. the study revealed and classified the benefits of human factors according to performance, wellbeing, safety, quality, cost, and other operational benefits. the study's main contribution is making the benefits of applying hfe in various systems and processes visible to potential adopters and researchers involved in the application of hfe. human factors such that they are visible to researchers and industry practitioners. thus, it sets an agenda for future debate, discussion and research.","application, implementation, benefits, human factors, hfe","This study reports on the review of literature on the application of HFE in socio-technical systems, specifically the studies that listed and demonstrated the realization of the benefits of the successful application of HFE. The study classified the benefits of applying HFE according to system performance, human well-being, safety, quality, cost, and other operational benefits. System performance, well-being, quality and safety scored high on the benefits of applying human factors. In contrast, cost and other operational benefits scored low. Cost benefit should be given careful attention in the studies of HFE since it plays a significant role when deciding on an intervention or new ways of doing work. The papers that formed part of the review incorporated HFE aspects in digital systems, technology, Industry 4.0 technologies, lean management, manufacturing, maintenance, design, workstations and layouts, production logistics, etc. They demonstrated a need to continue pursuing studies in the field of HFE for future industries. At the pinnacle of the Industry 4.0 discussions, many people held a notion that Industry 4.0 technologies would replace human. However, it is evident that in the future of work there is still a considerable role to be played by human. Thus, determining interconnections between human and technology and managing these interconnections well would be key to success of organizations. The use of HFE specialists would also be necessary on the basis that there is still a rare integration of digital elements with HFE as well application of HFE in various industries. The study made the following propositions for future research: • Making a comparative study between organizations that have adopted HFE and those that have not to determine significant differences. 100% 93% 60% 73% 40% 47% 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% System's Performance Well-being Safety Quality Cost Other operational benefits 575",mfundo nkosi department of mechanical and industrial engineering technology university of johannesburg south africa mnkosi@uj.ac.za,"References

153,"E-Commerce Optimal Packaging Project Alara Kumru, Kerem Tuna, Berfin Kondakcı, Efe Doğruer,","the subject of our senior design project is optimized product packaging. companies may generally have trouble packing goods of various types, sizes, and volumes. the amount of waste produced by using cardboard and the precise arrangement and dimensions of the boxes to be used in order packaging are the two most significant issues related to the packaging issue. random packaging, the use of parcels, and the absence of a set packaging sequence or rule result in wasteful cardboard usage, transportation space consumption, and financial loss because each parcel utilized has a cost. the boundaries and restrictions of the challenge were established after an analysis of potential packaging problems faced by the company. before modeling, there has been literature research. since we can use restricted amount of different sized boxes the main purpose of the model is to minimize the total volume with providing the information about which order should be placed on which box and in which order. since the real data set is so large, the heuristic box packing algorithm is developed and its output data is used to decide the packaging orders into boxes.","volume optimization, logistics industry, order packaging","without requiring any resources when the necessary data is provided. Our method computes the results with the expected speed and ease in accordance with the targeted and planned situation. The problem that may be encountered during the application of this method is that in the presence of very large and complex data, it may deviate from the optimal result. In smaller sizes, we observed that the optimality gap was approximately 1.72% on average when we selected 10 random orders and ran them in 3 boxes. 6. Conclusion 6.1 Summary of the Work Done As previously indicated, the project's main focus was on issues with suitable packaging for online sales. A literature review, investigation, and in-depth handling and analysis of the problem were all done throughout the problem's solution phase. According to the principle of having the least total volume, we produced the orders for this project as rectangular prisms. Along with the larger challenges, we also used the model we developed for it to smaller issues. Input data, iterative improvement, greedy resizing, box resizing, order transfer, and optimization techniques are planned, and a heuristics model built on top of the optimized box packing algorithm is created and programmed in Java. The problem is thoroughly evaluated. 6.2 Conclusion To determine the packaging orders into boxes, we designed the optimum box packing algorithm and used its output data. We employed iterative improvement, greedy search, and local search to create the optimized box packing algorithm. The goal of performing these searches is to identify the order packaging into boxes that comes the closest to being ideal. We sought to reduce the overall volume of orders that would be placed in a constrained number of boxes of various sizes. To tackle the issue, we examined the supplied data, and we programmed the algorithm in Java. To sum up, after collecting all the necessary data and information from the company and visiting the company, the problems were identified and made organized and resolved by using the necessary assumptions and creating the necessary algorithm. 1326","şevval berksöz and onat gürcanok faculty of engineering, department of industrial engineering, ozyegin university, turkey","References

Appendix II: PROMPETHEE-II 
PROMPETHEE is a compromise approach that uses the preference function to choose the best choice. It is applied 
in a variety of disciplines. In general, this technique presents alternatives and criteria, converts qualitative 
indications into quantitative indicators, and weights the indicators so that the sum of the weights equals one. The 
PROMPETHEE-II technique is used. This approach assigns a numerical value to each choice. 
Due to the distance between the two alternatives, the preference function P is used to compare the two possibilities 
 and 
 in index k. That is, as demonstrated in Equations (B-9 and 10), it is dependent on the distance between the 
two possibilities. 
 
(B-9) 
 
Equation (B-10) shows that the preference function , for comparing the two options 
 and 
in terms of the 
index , is due to the distance between the two options. That is, it depends on the distance between options 
 
and
. D in this respect represents distance. The distance between the values of option 
 and the value of option 
 
is stepwise. In general, this preference function is shown in Table A.1.

156,Supply Chain Modelling And Production Planning: A Case  Study In The Phosphate Industry,"the present paper discusses the problem of short-term supply chain planning for production and logistics operations in the chemical industry. our contribution is threefold. first, we designed a model of a real-world production site, translating the constraints and realities of the field into a mathematical model that is simple enough to be tractable but sufficiently rich to support decision-making. secondly, we formulated and solved this problem as a milp using the cplex solver. finally, we applied this model to the ocp safi plant, a chemical industry site of ocp group. using the model, we performed a sensitivity analysis on a real-life data instance, in order to detect the bottlenecks and determine the production boundaries. the results revealed that increasing the capacity of some specific production units, but not all, is required to increase the volume that can be produced and delivered. identifying these bottlenecks will help ocp group make informed decisions on how to distribute the investment effort, in order to increase the performance of the whole supply chain.",chemical industry,"Setting up an advanced planning and scheduling (APS) solution in manufacturing and supply chains is key to the performance of industrial chemical complexes, allowing supply chain managers to synchronize thousands of resources including machinery, raw materials, inventories, logistics, in order to fulfill the demands of the customers. Moreover, as stated in McKinsey (2022), building a digital twin of the supply chain, and using it to run “what-if” scenarios, is an essential part of efforts to achieve structural resilience and to be able to run the business in a volatile context. In this paper, we propose such a tool for a chemical industry site, in a deterministic context. Our contribution lies firstly in the modeling of the real-life production site, translating the constraints, and the reality of the field into a mathematical model, simple enough to be solvent and rich enough to bring value. The purpose of this model is to determine the production, transportation, and demand satisfaction plan while taking into account a variety of production, transportation, storage, and demand-related constraints. The objective function considered aims to maximize the produced and delivered volume. Although our model was designed for the Safi site of the OCP group, the model is quite generic and could be applied to other process manufacturing production systems. Second, we solved this model with a MILP solver (CPLEX). Finally, using this model, we conduct numerical experiments on a real case study to examine our studied supply chain through a sensitivity analysis and to identify its boundaries and possible improvements. To this end, we have manipulated the function objective to maximize the delivered product, by considering an infinite demand. We ran the model and examined the dual prices linked to each resource capacity constraint (production and transportation units). In this step, we revealed that positive dual prices are only associated with the manufacture of phosphorus and granulation. Then, we investigated the associated units by raising their capacities and evaluating their effect on the delivered volume. As discussed in the previous section, an increase of 6.37% in phosphoric units’ capacity results in a gain of 7,797, while doubling the capacity of the TSP production lines results in a gain of less than 7,687 in the total volume delivered. The results of our study provide valuable insights into the supply chain planning problem and support the policymakers in developing policies that support the growth of supply chain networks. Finally, there are several ways to enrich the model developed in this study. First, by integrating the scheduling plan for trains and trucks as well as loading and unloading vessels. Second, by incorporating real-time data on traffic, weather, and resource unavailability and propose methods to adjust the schedule. Another option would be to consider the stochastic version of the problem by harnessing historical data.","ibtissam guissou, agnes gorge, nizar el hachemi, and michel fender africa business school mohammed vi polytechnique university rabat, morocco ibtissam.guissou@um6p.ma, agnes.gorge@um6p.ma, nizar.elhachemi@um6p.ma, michel.fender@um6p.ma",
157,Exergy Analysis Of Aerothermal And Geothermal Heat  Pumps In A Critical Environment Application,"through the last decades, energy consumption presented a continuous increase and became a fundamental asset in every sector. considering heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (hvac), improvements have been progressively required, mainly when circumstances are also influenced by geopolitical and economical aspects. the present work discusses an exergy analysis of two existing heat pump (hp) technologies, air-source and ground-source for heating and cooling operations. these may be used for the replacement of the system of a critical environment, a bioterium, which currently comprises chillers for cooling and boilers for heating to provide environmental conditions that must be uninterruptedly maintained, thus requiring substantial energy consumption. with the purpose of exploring less demanding alternatives, an exergy analysis is performed in this work to establish a comparison between the two aforementioned hp technologies using an algorithm executed in python. for both equipment exergetic analyses, six different types of refrigerants are considered as well. in all scenarios, the ground-source hp presented a smaller exergy, alongside a considerably higher exergetic efficiency due to a smaller exergy destruction and a higher coefficient of performance (cop).","exergy, python","The present work aimed to perform an exergy analysis for an air-source and for a ground-source heat pump considering six different refrigerants. The application under consideration is a bioterium, an environment that requires a continuous utilization of the HVAC equipment, either for cooling or heating, according to the thermal needs. Thus, both equipment were compared in terms of exergy efficiency for both functions. For the exergy analysis itself, an algorithm in Python was developed and employed. In terms of equipment, the GSHP detains less available exergy than the ASHP. Nevertheless, the exergy destruction rates were significantly smaller with the former, which led to higher exergetic efficiencies and COPs for both cooling and heating modes. The main reason for that is the greater thermal stability of the ground when compared to the air, which presents a substantial variability along the year. In addition, and as a consequence, to these temperature parameters, the work provided by the compressor is reduced, which also reduces the energy input and, therefore, the exergy available alongside its destruction. Since the exergy destruction is directly related to the entropy variation, the components with the highest exergy destructions were the compressor and expansion valve, except for R32 systems that must be further analysed. Nevertheless, the exergy destruction is also dependent on several thermodynamic and chemical properties of the refrigerant employed. Among the analysed fluids, the one with best results was the R134a, which is currently in phase out process due to its elevated global warming potential. In this manner, a promising alternative in the long term are the refrigerants R1234ze and R290, which despite presenting a mild flammability level, present a low global warming potential. The refrigerant with worst results was the R410A, which is also in phase out process due to its high global warming potential. The results are quite similar when it comes to the COP concerning each refrigerant, where R134a and R410A presented the highest and the lowest COPs, respectively. Nevertheless, the differences among all the refrigerants analysed were minimum. Moreover, in terms of COP, R290 also appears to be a promising alternative in the near future. In the future, more work will be developed, considering other refrigerants, applications, and systems with other components that may increase their COP, such as accumulators and liquid receivers. 499","pedro barandier, alexandre miranda, antonio. j. marques cardoso cise - electromechatronic systems research centre, university of beira interior calçada fonte do lameiro, p – 6201-001 covilhã, portugal pedro.barandier@ubi.pt, alexborgster@gmail.com, ajamcardoso@ieee.org","References

159,A Review Of Employees Training And Development In  Navigating Through Pandemic Covid-19: Malaysian,"the global outbreak of covid-19 has had far-reaching effects on countries worldwide, influencing various aspects of life, economies, and markets. as a result of government policies, organizations have been compelled to adopt remote working arrangements. within this context, the performance of employees becomes a crucial concern for organizations. to effectively navigate the pandemic and develop a capable and adaptable remote workforce, organizations need to prioritize the development of their human capital. hence, this review paper focuses on exploring employee training during the covid-19 period in malaysia. the findings highlight the importance of training and development programs in successfully navigating the pandemic, as they offer numerous benefits and significantly influence employee performance. a great shift to digitalization of training is noticed with 86% of the companies shift their training and development programs to online, 76% of the companies plan to increase their online training programs, and 68% found online training to be equally effective. however, organizations face specific challenges when implementing virtual training, including the inadequacy of traditional programs and methods, limited collaboration and engagement, difficulties in assessing training outcomes, and issues in sustaining trainees' participation. additionally, the paper recommends that organizations explore and utilize existing training programs and technologies, while investing further in digitalization and virtual training initiatives.","covid-19, malaysia, training",,"perspective ahmed saleh ahmed saif al-shameri, siti sarah omar, sharaf al-azam faculty of technology management and business, universiti tun hussein onn malaysia johor, malaysia ahmedalshameri54@gmail.com, sarah@uthm.edu.my, sharaf.mw@gmail.com mahdi mohammed abdullah abkar faculty of civil engineering and built environment, universiti tun hussein onn malaysia johor, malaysia mahdi.mohammed34@gmail.com talaat hassan alhaj ali alawadhi faculty of technology management and business, universiti tun hussein onn malaysia johor, malaysia talaat_ali@yahoo.com",
160,Application Of Lean Six Sigma Methodology In Defect  Reduction: A Case Study Of Botswana Shade Net,"the purpose of the current manuscript is to discuss the application experiences of lean six sigma (lss) process improvement methodology in defect reduction. the work discussed in the manuscript pertains to the results that were obtained in the quality control improvement project of a shade net manufacturing plant in botswana, to eliminate product defects. the defects in this case, were defined as the snapping of the manufactured plastic threads used in the production of the shade nets. this snapping of the threads created holes on the knitted nets which also then led to inconsistencies in the knitted pattern of the nets. at any given month, these defects amounted to an average of 60% of the total production output which compounded to a yearly monetary loss of about us$290 250 to the company. several lss tools were applied within the dmaic (define-measure-analyze-improve-control) process improvement methodology from defining the problem through control and up to recommendations that could eliminate the process defects. tools such as sipoc (supplier-input-process-output-customer) diagrams, process maps, cause and effect diagrams, process capability analysis, gage repeatability and reproducibility (gage r&r), multiple linear regression and design of experiments (doe) were applied in the project. ultimately, a failure mode effects criticality analysis (fmea) was also produced which could help the company to maintain and control the process according to the recommendations that were produced. the main findings of the study revealed through regression analysis was that four major process variables affected the tensile strength of the threads, and this led to the observed defects. through doe the optimal settings of these variables were identified, and the tensile strength was observed to increase by 9.1% from an average of 35.8718 mpa to 39.1269 mpa. this result also led to a significant defect reduction from 60% to only 0.025% of the total production output and a jump in the process sigma level from 1.25 to 4.98.","lean six sigma, quality control","was made because according to Rajan et al (2018), quenching for continuous processes that take material greater than 25 kg for more than 5 hours directly from an extruder require water volume that is larger than 3 000 L assuming an initial water temperature of room temperature 26-27 degrees Celsius. 3.5 Control 813","manufacturing plant tirelo o. pekenene, tuelomburu s. mphathiwa, robert o. k. monageng, kobamelo mashaba, gandure jerekias, venkata kommula mechanical engineering department university of botswana (ub) gaborone, botswana monagengr@ub.ac.bw","References

161,Role Of Digital Leadership In Achieving Digital Readiness  Through Organizational Optimization.,"study determination is to deliver a framework for overpowering the obstacles headed digital readiness of the organizations, which are not prepared for upcoming industrial difficulties. interrelated theoretical lens of contextual leadership theory and strategic alignment model along with data analysis of 279 top manager from it sector in pakistan. result examination shows that organizational optimizations including top management commitment, strategic planning and inter-organizational collaboration mediates the relationship between digital leadership and firm’s digital readiness. study consumes significant professional and theoretic suggestion that no matter how strong is the leadership, means through which the desire outcome could be achieve should not be ignore. key words digital leadership, big data strategic planning and strategic alignment model. 1. introduction global trade analysis through the lens of contextual leadership theory acknowledges that leader’s art of behaving according to the context is in demand like never before. industry is approaching towards fourth industrial revolution that is branded by digitalization of business process. g7 countries comprises of canada, eu, france, germany, italy, japan, uk and us issued a signed declaration with a vision to place technology at the heart of global efforts to digitalize outdated paper-based systems from global trade to serve the customers effectively and efficiently mp (2021). uk digital secretary oliver dowden said g7 countries want to establish a convincing vision that how technology should support and enhance societies in the digital age. all the g7 countries have agreed to prioritize digital competition for digital revolution, developing framework addressing domestic reforms for digital transformation of organizations and collaboration among governments and stakeholder to support digital development (mp, 2021). 1.1. research problem highly active and responsive capabilities are observed in smart organizations. survey based on hundreds of firm shows that the organizations, which are digitally ready to encounter the future demand of fourth industrial revolution earned 16% extra than the average net profit margin of the relevant industry (weill & woerner, 2018). organizations which are not digitally ready to encounter future demands of fourth industrial revolution are most likely to suffer dramatically or even replace by agile competition and new start-ups (weill & woerner, 2018). this specific problem is challenging existence of all those organization which are not digitally ready. so pragmatic researcher should derive a frameworks, based on which organization can make a forward move towards digital readiness in true sense for meeting the future demand of industry 4.0 and can align themselves with g7 countries vision regarding digitalization. mcafee, brynjolfsson, davenport, patil, and barton (2012) claimed that in future successful firm will be those which are digitally ready. awan et al. (2021) claimed that getting equipped digitally required alignment at strategic level, strategic alignment model also stresses that strategic alignment should be there for achieving the desire outcome (henderson & venkatraman, 1992). in current study scenario, desire outcome is digital readiness of firms involved in manufacturing and its export or import. tijan, jović, aksentijević, and pucihar (2021) has identifies some barriers including lack of vision, strategy, coordination and collaboration whereas success factors were also identified including actively shaping future strategies (strategic planning), clear vison, inter-organizational collaboration and digital leadership. tijan et al. (2021) has explored the barrier and their potential remedial factors but a quantitative survey study is required to generate the generalizability of these factors. most important success factor they have identified is digital leadership. anak agung sagung and sri darma (2020) and kane, phillips, copulsky, and andrus (2019) claimed that digital leadership is all about transformative vision, forward locking and collaboration. anak agung sagung and sri darma (2020) also claimed that digital leader add value in what we do, which represents it strategic mindset. strategic mindset represents strategic planning of the leader that where the organization is and where it should be. 871",,"Study is conducted for existence of those firms that are not in group of future ready organization. Study has projected a model through which, factories can be transform into smart factories for their existence. Data is collected commencing 279 top managers of the IT firms in Pakistan that. Structure equation modeling is applied with bootstrapping for mediation test, outcomes displays that organizational optimization including top management commitment, big data strategic planning and Inter-organizational collaboration is crucial for achieving firm digital readiness.

171,Increased Capacity In Industrial Equipment  Inês Pereira Esteves,"this article discusses the application of continuous improvement tools in an aeronautical company. the main goals are to enhance equipment availability and efficiency, leading to improved overall equipment effectiveness and reduced energy costs. the focus is optimizing specific equipment with lower productivity due to limited data and documentation. the process at different workstations is analyzed, and data is collected to apply lean tools, aiming to increase efficiency by 10% and optimize the equipment's productive capacity by 20%. the article explores the fundamentals of lean, originating from the toyota production system, which seeks to eliminate seven types of waste. several lean tools such as single minute exchange of die, 5s, and standard work are utilized. additionally, kaizen practices like cross-functional teams, decentralized responsibilities, the pull system, and just-in-time are employed to complement lean manufacturing. the implementation process follows the plan-do- check-act methodology, supported by the hoshin kanri methodology, allowing for the proper sequencing of actions and validation of achievements. furthermore, the article touches upon the evolution of the aeronautical industry and its relationship with lean practices to establish relevant correlations. through the application of these methods, it was considered, based on the data obtained in the initial diagnosis, an increase of 17%, 55% and 31% in the efficiency of setups in autoclaves, computerized numerical control machines and ultrasound, respectively, which in all exceeded the goal of 10%. as for the increase in equipment availability, relevant results were also obtained compared to the 20% target, having reduced about 45h/year in autoclaves in two cycles along with a gain of 19% in the occupancy of the surtec.","aeronautic industry, lean manufacturing, oee, smed. 1587","The work carried out included a study on the theme, which served as a basis for defining the objectives and the methodologies to be adopted. Following this, it was decided that the PDCA methodology, aided by Hoshin Kanri, would be ideal for a project that aims to improve the productive capacity of industrial equipment. Furthermore, it was necessary to know the context in which the project would be developed and, as such, an analysis of the aeronautical industry and its evolution at a national and global level was performed. With that in mind, we proceeded to research about Lean and, more specifically, Lean Production and its evolution. In this sense, it was also essential to evaluate the appropriate continuous improvement tools to be applied in this context to increase the efficiency and availability of the machines. In addition, it was also intended to reduce energy costs. In this way, a thorough study was done from the methodologies to be adopted, to the Lean philosophy and its tools that would then be implemented in the equipment identified as more critical to reduce waste, setup times and thus improve productivity. Considering the methodologies and tools studied, the workstations were analyzed, and a correlation was established between their identified needs and the application method. From this, multiple improvement actions were developed in the workstations previously defined. The best results came from the autoclaves, both in terms of the efficiency of setups and availability, where a reduction of 364h/year was totaled. In the CNC machines it also resulted in a significant improvement in efficiency and, specifically in CMI, a 39% increase in availability, which translates to almost a reduction of one shift. In this sense, it is pointed out for future work the reduction of another 6% of the machine occupation to grant this objective later outlined. Overall, it is possible to conclude that the goals initially set were met, considering the data that resulted from the improvement actions implemented at each workstation. Simultaneously, a gradual increase in OEE is already perceptible in some posts, however, this indicator is not yet operational in all, since in the initial diagnosis the non- use of this indicator was identified, which made it impossible to use this indicator in most work posts. However, considering the existing data and other indicators used, it is already possible to indicate that the improvements had a positive effect.","masters in mechanical engineering - industrial management school of engineering polytechnic of porto porto, portugal marisa joão guerra pereira de oliveira department of mathematics of engineering school of engineering polytechnic of porto and associate laboratory for energy, transports and aerospace (laeta-inegi), porto, portugal mjo@isep.ipp.pt maria teresa ribeiro pereira department of mechanical of engineering school of engineering polytechnic of porto and associate laboratory for energy, transports and aerospace (laeta-inegi), porto, portugal mtp@isep.ipp.pt. filipe r. ramos department of statistics and operational research ceaul-centro de estatística e aplicações, faculdade de ciências, universidade de lisboa lisboa, portugal frramos@ciencias.ulisboa.pt",
172,A Conceptual Framework For Successful Implementation Of  An Organizational Digital Transformation,"digital transformation technologies can enhance work processes and redesign the employees’ tasks but could have a huge impact on the employee work deliverables and ultimately the goals and objectives of the organization. the rapid growth in cloud-based applications, real-time customer interactions and feedback, and data analytics reports are forcing organizations to redefine the business processes, organizational structures, and human resource utilization to gain a competitive advantage by incorporating and implementing the new digital technologies (korn, 2018). although any organization that would like to succeed in implementing a digital transformation strategy needs to focus on multiple disciplines and principles within the organization. equally, an organization could potentially achieve its goals by re-engineering business processes and by looking at technologies that underpin and drive organizational advancements in their market segment but could be negatively impacted by the lack of skilled employees (almgren and skobelev, 2020). however, these depend on two elements, namely the choice of digital technology and financial capabilities with the ability to use it for value creation. this paper provides some insight into a potential conceptual framework to ensure an organization succeeds by focusing on the critical importance of highly skilled and competent human resources. the article reviews and defines the potential relationship and influence between the leadership styles and the utilization of the human capital within the organization, with the notion that an organization must then understand and select the correct digital transformation technology for their industry and ensure alignment with the organizational goals and objectives. additionally, it advocates an approach to defining and measuring the return on investment through cost analysis processes and to ensure the implementation of the correct digital strategy roadmap. recent research findings indicate that the estimated failure ratio is between 66% to 84%. (correani, and de massis, et al, 2020). the inconsistency between the strategy formulation and implementation process is the main issue for failure which has a huge financial impact on the organization’s revenue, work deliverables, and products and services. as a result, future management processes must ensure that the elements are managed and adjusted to address any future economic and market challenges, trends, and new opportunities. subsequently, such an approach creates the foundation and building blocks for success, and future growth for an organization, which could be achieved and ensured through a conceptual framework for the successful implementation of an organizational digital transformation that ensures all the elements of an organization are redesigned and changed through the digital transformation project.

175,A Literature Review Of The Effect Of Productivity  Improvement Systems On Productivity Growth Of,"the masonry brick manufacturing small and medium scale enterprises smes contribute significantly towards the socio and economic development of the republic of south africa (rsa). the masonry brick manufacturing industry assists in the development of construction and is a source of income for smes, as well as creating employment opportunities for the uneducated, unskilled, semi and skilled human capital. however, there are productivity challenges that negate growth in productivity. the methodology proposed for the study is based on reviewing literature whereby the main question is “how do productivity improvement systems influence productivity growth of the masonry brick construction smes?” the study explores productivity improvement systems that can be used to improve the productivity of masonry brick smes. based on the results of the review, the study recommends that the masonry brick smes identify latent variables that impede productivity growth within their organisations in order to attain long-term term market and financial feasibility.","productivity, ergonomics, omopariola","The explored literature demonstrated how instrumental identified productivity improvement systems (ergonomics, human resource management and business process re-engineering) are in driving productivity within the masonry brick construction SMEs. In accordance to the review of applied literature, productivity improvement systems are lean manufacturing mechanisms that coherently contribute significantly towards the productivity growth and efficacy of the masonry brick manufacturing SMEs. However, literature read also highlighted key challenges involving a lack of concentration, emotional and physical stress, musculoskeletal disorders (MSD), incompetent management, economic challenges, technological advancements and competition from rival companies, inadequate training and lack of investment from the government and not being able to integrate smart-technology within operational process that negate growth in productivity. Thus, undermining the significant impact that these productivity improvement systems have on aggregate productivity. It is then pivotal that the masonry brick construction SMEs identify latent variables that impede productivity growth within their organisations in order to attain market and financial feasibility. 5. Future Research The study explored research constructs using a qualitative methodology through reviewing accredited journals, articles, government documents etc. Thus, empirical findings could not be drawn. Furthermore, this research work is part of an ongoing study. The research study does not account for all productivity improvement systems that undermine the significant impact that productivity systems have on productivity. In addition, the study only employed a qualitative review of the literature. This limits the study’s generalisability to other masonry brick construction SMEs in South Africa, Africa and globally. Thus, opening up other future research prospects. Research in the future should focus on quantitatively assessing the impact of productivity improvement systems on productivity growth of the masonry brick construction SMEs. 6.","the masonry brick construction , small and medium scale enterprises in south africa lucky boy makhubedu faculty of science university of johannesburg johannesburg, south africa luckyboym@uj.ac.za charles mbohwa pro-vice chancellor strategic partnerships and industrialisation university of zimbabwe harare, zimbabwe cmbohwa@yahoo.com",

181,Towards A Neuro-Symbolic Approach To Bridge The Gap  Between Brain And Mind-Inspired Models,"this paper proposes an approach beyond the current large language models (llms) milestones. to achieve optimal results, llms require careful fine-tuning. using techniques such as prompt engineering and in context language (icl), it is possible to provide llms with the necessary guidance to perform specific tasks with incredible accuracy and relevance. deep neural networks have limited capabilities in intelligent behavior (i.e., in understanding the meaning of its input). hence, the scientific community started to question more heavily in recent years whether deep learning alone could get us closer to artificial general intelligence (agi). the authors of this paper believe that the training and adaptive behavior challenges were a big part of the problem and that symbolic techniques did not advance simultaneously as deep neural networks. hence, revisiting and renewing the symbolic techniques and combining them with deep learning models like the llms can bridge the gap between neural techniques and symbolic knowledge representation. our proposed system has been shown to significantly improve the performance of llms in terms of hallucination rate while providing flexibility of semantic input processing to symbolic systems.","bert, gpt-3, npc programming","In this paper, we presented a model combining connectionist and symbolic techniques, leveraging in particular the latest advances in the neural computing field, the LLMs. Although the SAuroN model proposed here is a simple example of leveraging state-of-the-art LLMs to perform symbolic processing, this can potentially be applied to create other forms of knowledge representation, such as knowledge graphs, propositional logic, and semantic networks, among others. We believe that with this approach, the best of both worlds can be achieved: the plasticity of neural networks, the language understanding capabilities of the latest LLM models, and the knowledge representation and manipulation of the symbolic models. Naturally, this is a simple first step in that direction, and there is much room to explore and improve. SAuroN introduces the possibility of transitions between states to be semantically triggered, and the symbolic modeling avoids hallucination and injection attacks, current challenges for LLM models. It could potentially help the limitations described in (Bubeck et al. 2023) around weak symbolic manipulation and basic mathematical mistakes. In terms of size limitations, LLMs have a limited context, and as a system becomes more and more complex, the size of the prompts used for few shot learning might become a limitation. As we use SAuroN or models derived from its idea, the symbolic layer might be used to select the proper prompt, narrowing the context for that particular moment of the operation and removing that limitation. A few ideas for further exploration and development are: • How to transfer the knowledge acquired from the operation of the symbolic layer to the neural layer • The model can handle inputs with great flexibility and plasticity, but the outputs would still follow traditional logic rules. To make outputs flexible, we need to give more room to the generative AI, and the problems of hallucination and injection would be back. • As we create more sophisticated symbolic models like knowledge graphs, new ideas will be necessary to search, extract, and present knowledge As discussed in this paper, the latest advances in the neural computing field, the LLMs, are sparking the debate about hybrid techniques and different approaches to reach a superior quality AI system. At the same time, these new models are being used to create exciting novel applications in different areas and industries. The idea of combining neural and symbolic techniques is not new, and we believe as one field advances, the other should be revisited to evaluate the potential of the combination of both. We hope this contribution helps in the pursuit of pieces of the ancient puzzle, that is, to understand the relations between the brain and the mind, and take us one step closer to recreating those impressive structures on artificial systems. 1642","fabio caversan, lucas rodrigues, geanderson ferreira, danilo de almeida, carlos veber, gabriel dias rezende martins stefanini group sai research and development labs 27100 w 11 mile rd, southfield, mi 48034, usa fabio.caversan@stefanini.com dr. nabih jaber and dr. george pappas department of electrical and computer engineering lawrence technological university southfield, mi 48075, usa njaber@ltu.edu, gpappas@ltu.edu","References
