4,Reduce Slow Moving Inventory Of Convenience Stores:  A Case Study,"traditional inventory models do not take into account various circumstances that are unique to a retail setting. the purpose of this study is to high light one such issue, namely, inventory management of slow moving items. the impact of all these decisions led the company to hold inventory levels of about 30 days on average with replenishment cycles of seven days. this work describes the efforts of the company to decrease inventory levels through the application of concepts associated to the forecasting and the impact of pack sizes for slow moving items. results of the pilot studies of implementing the suggested initiatives are provided.","slow moving items, display inventory, retail echelon","and recommendations The level of competitiveness of the C – store retailing sector is dependent on the level of product availability at the store. Under these circumstances, the effectiveness with which inventory management is performed becomes very important. Too much is expensive, and too little implies the appearance of more frequent stockouts. The case of study treated in this paper deals with the management of inventories of C – F items for the leading network of C – stores in Mexico. The company was dealing with the problem of having excessive level of inventories in its stores in terms of days of inventory. An exhaustive analysis of the contribution to this excess was developed and found that the C – F categories of items were very important. Thus, three initial initiatives were designed and implemented in corresponding pilot programs; modifying the forecast procedure for the items; changing the rounding up to case pack sizes rule and; eliminating the F items from the national catalogue of the company. The impact expected with the full implementation of the previous initiatives totals 6.2 days of inventory in the stores. This additional work is programmed to be carried out during the first semester of 2018. Further research work to be done will focus on the application of the ADIDA scheme for the forecasting of items A and B.","bernardo villarreal, leslie sosa, jesus vazquez, estefanía quintanilla, mariana herrera & delia villarreal universidad de monterrey san pedro garza garcía, n.l., méxico 66238 bernardo.villarreal@udem.edu leslie.sosa@scm.the-klu.org jesus.vazquez@udem.edu estefanía.quintanilla@udem.edu mariana.herrera@udem.edu delia.villarreal@udem.edu",
5,A Comparison Of Ambulance Location Models  In Two Mexican Cases,"the development of several ambulance location models have been discussed in the academic literature. most of these models have been further extended to consider more realistic situations into account and the use of different assessment criteria. however, there is not an exhaustive literature that takes the existing standard models to compare them according to the criteria used in practice. in this work, we undertake the task of comparing the performance of several ambulance location models on coverage and response time criteria. the results of this work are important to help emergency medical organizations to define their most adequate model for defining their ambulance base structure. the comparison of the models is carried out in two mexican emergency operations of the red cross located in the cities of monterrey and tijuana.","ambulance location, response time, demand covering","Similar performance behavior of the three models compared in this study, the DSM, the ARTM, and the MEXCLP, were observed for the two Mexican cases studied: Monterrey and Tijuana. These cities are different in size, demand behavior and density. It was observed that when the DSM reaches its performance limits (i.e. 100% or almost), the increase of ambulances does not contribute to an improvement in RT. However, this is not true the other way around, since the RT is always susceptible to improvement. For the ARTM, an increase in the number of ambulances contributes steadily to improvements in both the objective function and the coverage. It should be addressed a multi-objective approach with objective functions that promote at the same time to maximize coverage and minimize response times; since each model pulls the solution towards its objective function but does not necessarily promote an improvement in the other criteria. The MEXCLP is the model that shows a constant improvement with the increase of ambulances in both types of criteria (coverage and RT), but the RTs obtained are well above the optimal ones, which is not good. It is suggested to complement the ARTM, in a way that involves the backup coverage. On the other hand, the MEXCLP has a great potential for improvement if it is considered dynamically, so that the probability parameter that an ambulance is occupied 𝑝𝑟 is observed and taken as a changing value according to the time interval and the actual number of ambulances in operation.

6,A Multiple Criteria Approach For Defining The Ambulance  System Structure: A Case Study,"the definition of the ambulance emergency medical system structure (emss) is an important issue in the healthcare sector. the emss consists of the number and location of ambulance bases required to satisfy an established service level or optimize a certain criterion. an important effort of academic research has been realized to determine the optimal emss based on the optimization of single objectives. however, as evidenced by the different criteria utilized in the vast literature developed, this issue could be discussed under several criteria simultaneously such as demand coverage and ambulance response time concepts. in this paper, we will undertake a multicriteria approach for supporting decision makers to determine their most preferred emss. this approach is applied to the monterrey metropolitan operations of the mexican red cross. results of the application are provided.","ambulance location, response time, demand covering",,"jenny, díaz ramírez, edgar granda & bernardo villarreal universidad de monterrey san pedro garza garcía, n.l., méxico 66238 edgar.granda@udem.edu, bernardo.villarreal@udem.edu, gabriela.morales@udem.edu yazmin maldonado instituto tecnológico de tijuana tijuana, mexico yaz.maldonado@gmail.com",
7,Analysis Of Development Policies In Occupational Health And  Safety Management System: A System Dynamics Approach,"despite today’s bold presence of machinery and the progress of technology in societies, human’s safety, and occupational health are still under the shadow of numerous hazards. in order to ensure sustainability, in different sectors of industries, occupational health and safety must be observed diligently and businesses have every reason to be concerned. it is estimated that annually 120 million injuries, caused by work-related accidents, have led to 220 thousand death reports all over the world. therefore, precautious measures should be taken in order to protect labor force against unfortunate repercussions, stemmed from the hazards of the workplace. in an overall sense, injuries and occupational accidents, are the result of a set of unsafety (actions and conditions). therefore, accidents can be decreased in rate by identification, prevention and elimination of this unsafety. the main purpose of this research is to propose a system dynamics model to analyze dynamisms of safety management systems, occupational health and accident management. using such approach, and with the aid of causal feedback loops analysis and stock and flow structure, we can define and conceptualize complex interactions within these systems. in this approach we model the structure of their relationships; and lastly, simulate their dynamic behaviors. results show that implementing policies related to human factor engineering and promote safety culture and standardization in the workplace, were the major appropriate and effective solutions which can have a positive effect on accidents management, they can help to develop the health and safety management system. also, among these policies, both safety culture and human factor engineering have significant impacts on decreasing the number of accidents, but from a long-term viewpoint, safety culture is the most effective.","accident, safety culture",,"mahdi bastan department of industrial engineering university of eyvanekey garmsar, iran bastan@ut.ac.ir leila azizi baraftabi department of industrial engineering university of eyvanekey garmsar, iran leila.azizi@eyc.ac.ir stefan groesser department of engineering and information technology bern university of applied sciences bern, switzerland stefan.groesser@bfh.ch farrokh sheikhahmadi department of business information technology, pamplin college of business virginia tech, usa farsha@vt.edu","REFERENCES

8,Implementation Of Six Sigma Tools In Building  Construction,"since the building's problems in construction projects have increased, there is serious need to focus on the quality of building constructions industry. even though six sigma has been employed in the manufacturing and other industries, it is quite a fairly new impression in the construction project. therefore, a case study of how six sigma has been established in the building industry to identify problems of building projects in amman. the main objectives of this case study to investigate the implementation of six sigma tools to investigate the main building's problems and the root causes of these problems. also, the study intends to implement these tools to improve the performance and the efficiency of construction projects. to achieve this objective, the data is collected from government institutions to identify the main building problems and then the survey-based approach is used in order to identify the root causes of these problems. the main results of six sigma tools showed the main problems in building projects in amman are excavation collapse, defective water proofing system at roof and bad drainage system of rainwater and lack of ventilation which represent 52.2% of total problems in building projects. although the concept of using pareto analysis and cause and effect diagrams have been around for a considerable period of time, the paper has successfully shown how can make use of these simple six sigma tools to find out the root causes of the problem and allocate resources to eliminate such problems. this study may trigger an important debate over the research and implementation of six sigma in the construction industry of developing countries that may greatly benefit by improving the quality of their projects. key words: six sigma tools, excavation collapse, building construction. 1. introduction there are numerous problems associated with quality in projects constructed by international firms. the construction problems refer to inaccurate design, faulty execution, and bad concrete mixtures. a lot of construction problems 65",,"Six Sigma as a quality management practice is gaining importance in Building Construction. This study has attempted to contribute to the understanding of performance and implementation aspects of Six Sigma in building construction. This study has identified the relative importance of the causes defect influencing in Amman’s construction industry by applying Six Sigma. These causes of problems must be identified as early as possible so that quality can be improved. Six sigma tools and techniques that have been applied in this research includes Pareto, cause and effect diagram, check list sheet, histogram, scatter diagram. From previous analysis it can be concluded that the cause of excavation collapse are: improper shoring or sloping for excavation sides, materials and machinery resting dangerously close to excavation, poor dewatering and drainage of ground and rain water during excavation and Increased soil density due to the presence of wastewater sum pits .Also, it illustrates the causes lead to problems in water proofing system at roof and bad drainage of rainwater are neglecting cleaning of building roof, using bad quality of insulation materials, placing waterproofing above thermal insulation, using poor quality of concrete, and unqualified labor .Regarding to ventilation problems, the causes of it are Lack of adequate ventilation systems to drive out water vapor from wet areas such as kitchens, bathrooms and swimming pools, violation of spaces dedicated for ventilation purposes, inadequate location and insufficient sizing of doors and windows during the design stage, and bad internal design which prevents entrance of fresh air .The implementation of Six Sigma in construction project has resulted on fill a gap in knowledge of common problems in the construction industry, which can serve as a guide for contractors and construction managers for helping to achieve a competitive level of quality and a cost-effective project. Barriers and critical success factors for six sigma implementations in the construction industry in the Amman could be potential future research direction. 72","maha alkasisbeh e-mail: amaharedaabdel.alkasisbeh@wmichl.edu 1department of civil engineering western michigan university, kalamazoo, mi. rabia almamlook e-mail: rabiaemhamedm.almamlook@gwmich.edu 1department of industrial engineering western michigan university, kalamazoo, mi. muna alkasasbeh e-mail: alkas1mr@cmich.edu 1department of mathematics central michigan university, mount pleasant, mi. muteb alshammari e-mail: mutebmohammedalshammari@wmich.edu 1department of civil engineering western michigan university, kalamazoo, mi.","References

11,An Economic Assessment Of South African Electricity  Supply Systems,"with regards to the rapid development of renewable energy resources, which is seen as sustainable electricity generating technologies. the costs analysis related to various power supply technologies are critical for business decision making. to this end, the south african government by means of its energy department has signed an agreement to add 2 300mw of renewable energy generating sources, which will be developed by the independent power producer. thus, this research paper used two different approaches (the levelized cost of electricity (lcoe) and the levelized avoided cost of electricity (lace). this latter was developed with the aim of addressing the issues left out by lcoe, which are crucial to business decision making. in this paper, at least 10 different power producing plants (coal, gas, nuclear, biomass, geothermal, hydroelectric, wind offshore, wind onshore, solar photovoltaic, concentrated solar power) were used as case study. the results indicate that of all technologies, geothermal ranks at the first place as the most economic competitive alternative, followed by coal technology. furthermore, the results illustrate that the worse technologies in terms of economic viability are solar photovoltaic, concentrated solar power, and wind. as far as the authors are aware this study is the first example in the context of the south african energy sector.",,,"ndala yves mulongo and pule aaron kholopane faculty of engineering and the built environment university of johannesburg, po box, 524, auckland park, 2006, south africa nmulongo@uj.ac.za",
12,A Comparative Analysis Of The Potential South African  Renewable Energy Sources Using Analytical Hierarchy,"south africa one of the most developed country in the continent of africa had been dealing with serious challenges such as substantial growth in residents and increasing per capita electrical energy use that requires maximum utilization of existing electricity generating sources. presently, more than 88% of electricity is being generated by means of fossil fuels with coal leading the raking by feeding the national power grid with approximately 72% of electrical energy produced. however, this power supply system puts a colossal strain on the economy and triggers significant damage to the ecosystem in general. to mitigate, this high reliance over non-renewable electricity producing resources, the south african government along with its department of energy as well as the electricity utility decided to implement measures with the aim of promoting the production of electricity through the renewable energy resources. however, these decisions have been primarily made with the goal of reducing the power crisis, without giving a significant consideration to the environmental, economic, social, and technical aspects concerning all the proposed renewable energy resource alternatives. to bridge this gap, this paper used the analytical hierarchy process (ahp) in order to define the absolute priorities of the renewable energy sources in the south african energy sector. the parameters such as environmental, economic, social, and technical were taken into account in this study with the aim of identifying and ranking the electricity technologies such as biomass, wind, hydro, and solar energy. various analyses including sensitivity ones were conducted in order to determine the most promising energy source between these technologies. the outcomes of these analyses indicate that biomass is the most promising option with 52.6%, followed by wind with 27.2%, hydro 12.9%, and solar energy 6,9%.",,"The overall aim of this study was to assist decision makers in the South African electricity sector concerning the selection of the most and promising renewable energy sources. To this end, AHP approach as one of the MCDA was applied to different attributes and alternatives, the attributes include the economic, environmental, social, and technical aspects. While, the alternatives considered were biomass, wind, hydro, and solar energy. From the figure 2 above, it can clearly be seen that biomass is the most promising option with 52.6%, followed by wind with 27.2%, hydro 12.9%, and solar energy 6,9%. When computing the priority vector, economic attribute led the raking with 42.6%, followed by social aspect with 23.4%, environmental attribute with 17.5% and in closing technical aspect has had 16.4%. it is therefore believed that the results of this work will help all the parties involved in implementing policy associated with the electricity production.","process ndala yves mulongo and pule aaron kholopane faculty of engineering and the built environment university of johannesburg, po box, 524, auckland park, 2006, south africa nmulongo@uj.ac.za",
13,An Environmental Impact Of Power Supply Systems: A  Comparative Analysis Case Study Of The South African,"over the last decade, there has been a growing cognizance concerning the environmental degradation caused by the greenhouse gases emissions release during the production of electricity. this awareness along with the issue surrounding the depletion of natural resources, has led many countries across the world, comprising south africa to explore the alternatives for mitigating this situation and developing strategies to move away from conventional electricity generating sources towards ‘’low-emissions’’ electricity technologies. however, with the current economic growth and increased of population, ‘’high-carbon emissions’’ electricity technologies are expected to be used for many decades to come, especially in south africa where roughly 88% of energy are being generated from fossil fuels. keeping this in mind, this paper aimed at measuring and comparing the environmental impact between coal and biomass-based power plants in the context of the south african energy sector. the assessments were conducted by means of fourteen environmental indicators. the results of the assessments indicate that the coal- fired power plant has significant ecological impacts regarding the global warming, freshwater eutrophication, and fossil depletion categories than the biomass electricity generating source.","coal, biomass",,"electricity sector ndala yves mulongo and pule aaron kholopane faculty of engineering and the built environment university of johannesburg, po box, 524, auckland park, 2006, south africa nmulongo@uj.ac.za",
14,A Sustainability Analysis Of The South African Power Supply  Systems By Means Of The Weighted Sum Method,"energy sector is a key player in the economic and social growth of a nation and to the quality of humans’ lifestyle. however, considering the way it is being mined, generated and employed, two serious flows have arisen. foremost, the whole power supply system has become very ineffective. secondly, important ecological burdens are generated from the activities linked to the power supply system. thus, over the last decade, the sustainability assessment of electricity technologies has drawn significant attention from scholars and industrial practitioners. decision regarding sustainable energy development is based on a wide range of indicators. however, in the context of the south african energy sector, there is a paucity of such wide analysis. therefore, to bridge this gap, we have made use of the weighted sum method, which is one of the multi criteria decision analysis approach to assess and compare 9 different electricity generating technologies on a basis of 7 sustainability indicators (load factor, the operations and maintenance costs, the costs of producing electricity, greenhouse gases emissions, sulphur dioxide, oxides of nitrogen; and lead. the results of the assessments demonstrate that off all technologies wind and solar thermal are the most sustainable alternatives in the context of south africa. additionally, we have noticed that hydropower and geothermal technologies have the potential to provide considerable sustainability developments over conventional power technologies (coal, gas, and nuclear). lastly, off conventional technologies coal and gas demonstrate a good sustainability performance than coal in most cases.",,"Here, will discuss the results as presented in the previous section. Figure 1. Techno-economic indicators Figure 2. environmental indicators In this paper, we have made use of MCDA to assess and compare different electricity generating sources, including thermal and renewable energy sources on a basis of 7 sustainability indicators comprising technical, economic, and environmental making use of quantitative minimum, nominal, and maximum values. As far as far as the author is aware this study is the first example in the context of the South African energy sector. To this end, energy policy decision makers may make use of these findings in order to assist in choosing the technology meeting an acceptable set of sustainable development requirements. As it can be seen from the figure 1 and 2, the results demonstrate that off all technologies wind and solar thermal are the most sustainable alternatives in the context of South Africa as a whole. Additionally, we have noticed that hydropower and geothermal technologies have the potential to provide considerable sustainability developments over conventional power technologies (coal, gas, and nuclear). Off conventional technologies coal and gas demonstrate a good sustainability performance than coal in most cases. These outcomes insinuate that policy makers should encourage the adoption and implementation of renewable energy sources. Though, these latter still not competitive to conventional electricity technologies in terms of the load factor and cost of producing electricity. It should be pointed out that the results of our sustainability assessments do not take geographical boundaries into account. Since the results presented in this work are the South African-based and might therefore not be relevant to a worldwide extent. Nevertheless, an akin approach used with whereabouts-particular data might be suitable to decision-making process from a global scale perspective. 110","ndala yves mulongo, pule aaron kholopane, clinton aigbavboa faculty of engineering and the built environment university of johannesburg, po box, 524, auckland park, 2006, south africa nmulongo@uj.ac.za","REFERENCES

15,An Environmental Assessment Of Energy Sector: A Critical  Review,"over the past decades, the primary goal of business corporations has customarily concentrated on the economic growth, and meanwhile keeping consumers happy by meeting their needs. nevertheless, due to ever-increasing pressure regarding ecological and social concerns from governments, non-governmental organizations, and consumers have forced various organizations, mainly electricity utilities and manufacturing companies, to reconsider their goals by taking the environmental and social aspects into account. however, a global challenge has emerged concerning the development of such concept. because, there is a lack of a rational and trustworthy approach designed for measuring environmental burdens, which remain a complex task for various business corporations. especially for the energy sector that is considered as the driving-factor of ecological deterioration all over the world. considering this, this paper reviews a set of previous environmental frameworks applied to energy sector. the results indicate that there is a lack of a holistic framework in the current literature, since many studies focused on evaluating the environmental impacts generated during the extraction of raw material and production of energy stages, thus, ignoring other life cycle stages such as processing of raw material, transportation of raw material, and transmission and distribution of end-product to end-users. therefore, this paper seeks to bridge this gap by assisting decision policy makers to have a comprehensive understanding regarding the connections between all the life cycle stages and thus identifying ways to analyse them.",,,"ndala yves mulongo and pule aaron kholopane faculty of engineering and the built environment university of johannesburg, po box, 524, auckland park, 2006, south africa nmulongo@uj.ac.za",
16,Improvement Of Superficial Hardness Of S355Jr Steel By  Superficial Plastic Deformation,"surface hardness plays an important role in lifetime of a mechanical part subjected to friction and wear. indeed, the hardness can be improved by processes of superficial plastic deformation (dps), such as the mechanical surface treatment ""tms"", in particular the ball burnishing. however, the result of treatment is conditioned by mastery of operation thus ensuring treated parts good mechanical and geometric properties. experimental work was carried out by applying ball burnishing process on s355jr steel specimens, in order to observe influence of treatment regime parameters on surface hardness 'hv'. two parameters of regime were considered namely: pressure force ""py"" and number of passes ""i"". the relationship between these parameters and microhardness measured at ""hv"" surface has been highlighting using factorial design plans 22. moreover a mathematical model has been obtained allowing prediction of response (hv) as well as optimization of parameters of treatment regime. the experimental results showed that for surface hardness hv it is possible to reach a 45% improvement rate for a pressure force p = 20 kgf and a number of passages i = 3 for this material.","surface hardness, factorial designs, ball burnishing, optimization 126",,"abdeldjalil bouri industrial technologies research center. crti. p.o.box 64,chéraga-16014, algeria abdou-gmz@hotmail.com mounira bourebia industrial technologies research center. crti. p.o.box 64,chéraga-16014, algeria mounirabourbia@gmail.com, m.bourbia@crti.dz sihem achouri industrial technologies research center. crti. p.o.box 64,chéraga-16014, algeria souma_sihem@yahoo.fr laouar.lakhder laboratory of industrial mechanics, badji mokhtar university bp12 -2300, annaba, algeria lakla_55@yahoo.fr",
17,Towards Increasing The Use Of Pre Fabrication Components  In Malaysia Construction Industry,"the use of pre fabrication components in the construction industry around the world has long been introduced. malaysia is also not left behind in introducing the use of this type of construction method. the use of pre fabrication components was started in the 1960s. however, after more than 50 years, the use of pre fabrication components in each of the construction projects is still low and received less attention. this study looks at the main factors that slow the use of pre-fabrication components in the construction industry. this study was conducted by involving a company as respondent. interview method was used to obtain information and was rewritten in text form. the results of the interview also found that in pre-fabrication, the main problem of stakeholders refused to use this type of construction method due to faster construction time but the payment received was slow and based on progress payment. most of the projects using pre fabrication will be completed faster but the payments received from the client are a little late.",team integration,"In the most volatile environment of construction industry, the management of the construction industry needs to be aware of all the signal of any turbulence and uncertainty. This company have been in the industry for a quite number of years have really understand what does in needs to sustain the business. Its not only about the capital that is always be the central issue in any business, but the art in sustaining and setting the future direction of the business is matters. It can be conclude that this company has several key points in making them as one of the successful construction company in Malaysia. The founder of this company highlighted among others, for a construction company to succeed, they should possess advance information, good company finance, cooperation with other contractors, work with design and build contractors, maintain a good relationship, have a good financial structure and finally, trust. For him, these are the key factors for ensuring the success and sustaining their business in construction industry. He mentioned that advance information that is needed in order for them to construct a project includes amount of project funds, the issue with supply chain, existing connection that is required and finally communication with the subcontractors. When all the required information is gathered, then there is chance to get the ball rolling. Good company finance is meant by making sure the there is no redundancy of work done by the employees. According to the company’s MD, redundancy in employees’ job can cause a serious damage to the company finance. In order to overcome this issue, he as the Managing Director of the company, will determine who are among the employee that makes multiple redundancy in their job. The moment they take leave, they will be asked not to continue working at the company. The employee then will use the opportunity while having holiday, they will also try to search for a new job. Those remains in the company can be utilize to do their job effectively and efficiently. This strategy alone could save the company finance close to RM 1 million. Cooperation with other contractor is the next strategy used by the company. Cooperation means working together in achieving the same desired goal. Cooperate with other contractor meaning, once they got project, we will also get the project. By doing this, every year, the company will get a project. Maintaining good relationship with manufacturers and suppliers is another strategy for any construction industry to succeed. The advantage when they manage to have a good relationship is through getting material prices at a cheaper price. This can only be achieved if and only if we have good relationships with the suppliers and manufacturers. Good financial structure can also be obtained through discipline in the company. To achieve this strategy, this company did a good strategy by not making any loans from the bank. Although the company was being approached by the banks to acquire a loan in order to increase their budget capital, this company did not want to make such commitments because they have enough capital to operate their business. It turns up that this strategy work well for them. Finally, the MD also mentioned that trust is a key point in sustaining his construction company. He is a firm believer that trust is not build in one day. For him, sharing his knowledge and experience to his staff is something that be benefitted to his company. Providing trust to his staff in making their job would also ease his burden. But, trust is always one of the key issue for the company to succeed in the long run. With all the above mentioned strategy did by this company, these are their ingredients in making sure that their company can do well in the near future. These ingredients are however can become a benchmark for any business to succeed. May be not all can be implemented, but some are key factors for businesses to succeed.

18,The Integration Of Marketing And Production Areas And Its  Impact On Organizations,"the development of business strategies demands coherence among the most diverse activities of the different areas of a company, aiming to provide coordinated actions and aligned with the goals of the organization. it becomes vital in this process to consider the influence that the strategic positions of each sector play on the others. recent technological advances aligned with the development of the production methods have had a great impact on the competitiveness of the companies and, consequently, attracted the attention of those related to the business and academic fields. thus, an effective dialogue between the marketing and production areas proves to be of great importance given that marketing seeks to understand, serve and satisfy consumer desires (kotler, 2000), while production seeks to responding the demand for products, optimizing processes and concentrating their efforts on obtaining efficiency out of productive resources. therefore, the objective of this study is to address the relationship between production and marketing and the impact of this integration on organizations.","marketing, production, integration, strategy, competitiveness",,"josé leandro miguel neto department of communication universidade lusófona de humanidades e tecnologias campo grande, 376, lisbon, portugal leandro.jneto@hotmail.com",
19,Identification And Ranking Of Innovation Management  Factors In Petrochemical Companies Producing,"since a major part of iran's petrochemical base products has been taken into account for export, it is essential and inevitable to consider international markets to examine the economic conditions of petrochemical development projects. the aim of this research in iran’s petrochemical industry is access to appropriate solutions to solve the facing challenges as well as development of innovation management model in petrochemical companies producing polyethylene products with the approach of the new polyethylene goods. data collection was conducted using the library and field studies. after taking these steps, 58 main indicators were considered by experts’ screening among 130 extracted indices. based on these indicators, final questionnaire was designed by likert scale and it was also distributed. finally, after asking comments of 105 managers and experts in 5 petrochemical companies producing polyethylene products on these indicators, data were collected and the research model was fitted using structural equation and smart pls software. after fitting, 29 indices, 2 factors and 6 dimensions were accepted for designing model. general dimension was composed of economic, organizational, regulatory and supervision factors while specific dimension was formed of technological, technical, marketing and systemic factors. according to research conducted for successful innovation management, considering all the above mentioned points is necessary in petrochemical companies which are producers of polyethylene products.",innovation,"as the major part of basic petrochemical products in Iran are intended currently for export, considering international markets for investigating economy conditions and Petrochemical development projects is essential and inevitable. This research was conducted in order to achieve appropriate solutions in order to solve the challenges and development of innovation management model in petrochemical companies which are producers of polyethylene products. In this study, two factors, 6 dimensions and 58 indices were obtained in this study in which the results of research indicated that economic, organizational, regulatory and supervisory, technological and technical marketing and systemic dimensions which were constituent dimensions of the general and specific the factors, have a significant effect on innovation management in petrochemical companies producing polyethylene products. As a result, between the two factors involved in this aspect, general factor has the maximum influence on innovation management. On the basis of the outcomes obtained of SMART PLS software output, indicators with the maximum amount of R2, have a greater share in explaining variance, and also in strengthening and predicting behavior of the related factors, thus, more attention is required for them. According to the results presented in Table 2, 3 and Fig. 1, following results and the recommendations are obtained: Economic development (AE9) in economic factor of the indicator has the highest R2 among other indicators of this dimension. This means that economic factor has the greatest share in Explaining variance of economic factor. In this regard, it is suggested that government increases investment in petrochemical companies producing polyethylene products and also pays special attention to such companies. The organizational structure of innovation reinforcement (BO11) in the organizational factor of indicator has the highest R2 In this context, it is recommended that structure of the petrochemical companies producing polyethylene products is revised and flexible structure with minimal bureaucracy is replaced. Specified national industrial policies (CR4) in regulatory and supervisory factor have the greatest share in explaining this factor. It is recommended that government takes action on codification of the industrial policies which reinforces innovative products for petrochemical companies in the field of Polyethylene to strengthen this factor. Compatibility of technology (DT3) in technological and technical factor has the highest r2 in which improvement to greater efficiency is suggested so that innovative technologies are used locally and considering the specific circumstances of the companies. Moreover, necessary Adaptability in this area is done in the field of technology transfer. Index of sales support (EM3) in marketing factor has the highest R2. Therefore, it is recommended that process of selling support is revised and custodian unit is also strengthened by education and training in order to strengthen this indicator. The highest amount of R2 in system factor is related to specialize screening system of ideas (FS1) .it is recommended that a system to collect and select ideas and eventually to implement selected ideas, that can lead to can lead to value takeover, is created in order to maintain and strengthen the proposed indicator.

20,Implementation Of Lean Manufacturing System To Eliminate  Wastes On The Production Process Of Line Assembling,"the main purpose of manufacturing industry is to produce goods economically in order to gain profit and be able to deliver products on time. ineffective and efficient production processes lead to non-current production. lean production systems help companies to be competitive, especially in terms of reducing waste (waste) that occurs in their operations. this study aims to reduce production waste in one automotive company by using waste relationship matrix (wrm), waste assessment questionnaire (waq) and value stream mapping (vsm). activities in the automotive industry is to design, develop, manufacture, market and sell motor vehicles in the world. the three methods are intended to identify and analyze the waste (waste) that occurred and make improvements to eliminate waste. from the research results obtained type of waste ""form"" is waiting and motion. while the type of waste ""to"" the inventory. the three types of waste is the greatest procession to occur in the process of assembly trimming on the production line of daihatsu sigra 1.5 l 3nr-ve, dohc dual vvt-i at pt. astra daihatsu motor. then performed the improvement implementation by using wrm and vsm method obtained the results of waste efficiency that occurs in the type of waste from the motion from 17.65% to 15.75%, waiting from 15.88 to 13.12%, and lead time down from 14.202 minutes to 12.322 minutes in one assembly process trimming. some suggestions for improvements made are the implementation of the fifo system (first in first out), improving changes in movement and movement of workers, and line balancing on the assembly line trimming process lines of automobile production processes.",,"is the work of the operators in all three WIPs at point (AT-06, AT-03, AT-04) and (AT-06, AT-07, AT- 08) is not balanced. For that to balance the work of the operator so there is no waiting time the authors suggest to combine these three machines with the concept of first in first out or FIFO and Line Balancing for the division of workload on each operator so that the system works will be balanced in one production line assembly electronic components This car. From the implementation results applied to PT. Astra Daihatsu Motor Training Center, the result of the repair of the original waste waiting 15.88% decreased to 13.12%. From the results of these improvements on waste reduction and waiting waste impact on the total lead time of this car trimming assembly process. Lead Time fell from 14,202 minutes to 12,322 minutes in a single line of assembly trimming process in the car production process. In other words from the application of improvements can be concluded that is able to eliminate the time of 1 sub process on the assembly line trimming of the time for 12 assembly process that is AT 1-12 becomes the time for 11 assembly process that is AT 1-11 that is decreased 1.88 minutes or 1 Minute 52.8 seconds. 4. Conclusions Based on the results of research with the method of Waste Relationship Matrix (WRM) and Value Stream Mapping (VSM) can be drawn the following conclusions: 1. Waste identification result using WRM (Waste Relationship Matrix) and VSM (Value Stream Mapping) method on assembly trimming process resulted 3 biggest waste that happened that is Inventory, Motion, and Waiting. 2. Waste type ""from"" that is Motion and Waiting has the largest percentage of 17.65% and 15.88% which means that waste Motion and Waiting if it happens then have a large enough effect to cause other waste that will increase the production lead time. 3. Waste type ""to"" the Inventory has the largest percentage of 18.24% this indicates that waste inventory is the waste that most affected other waste. 4. From the improvements made to eliminate waste motion & waiting is by improving the FIFO system (First in First Out), Improving changes in the movement of workers, and Line Balancing in the assembly trimming process produces some efficiency such as: • Reduced Motion waste from 17.65% to 15.75%, and • Waste Waiting from 15.88 to 13.12%, and • Lead Time fell from 14,202 minutes to 12,322 minutes in a single line of assembly trimming process in the car production process. In other words from the application of improvements can be concluded that is able to eliminate the time of 1 sub process on the assembly line trimming of the time for 12 assembly process that is AT 1-12 into the time for 11 assembly process is AT 1-11 that is decreased 1.88 minutes or 1 Minute 52.8 seconds. 5. Recommendations For future research related to the current research, the authors provide some suggestions as follows: 1. Preferably the object of research is not only limited to the area of assembly trimming course because this area is only one of the whole 5 line car production process. 2. Conducted an overall analysis with regard to factors in other production lines because there is a possibility in the process of production of the car there is another waste that occurs therein. 3. Created simulations with software with several production process scenarios to determine the impact or benefit of any repair recommendations and for the purpose of saving the cost of checking the improvements made.","electronic car components with wrm and vsm method [case study in production process of daihatsu sigra type 1.5 l 3nr-ve, dohc dual vvt-i] muhammad department of industrial engineering (ie ui) faculty of engineering industrial engineering department fakultas teknik - universitas indonesia, depok 16424 tel: (+62) 81380168541. fax: (021) 78885656 muhammad42@ui.ac.id yadrifil department of industrial engineering (ie ui) faculty of engineering industrial engineering department fakultas teknik - universitas indonesia, depok 16424 tel: (021) 78888805. fax: (021) 78885656 yadrifil@eng.ui.ac.id","References

21,"Deep Groundwater Potential And Chemical Analysis Based On  Well Logging Analysis At Kapuk-Cengkareng, West Jakarta,",". the special capital region of jakarta is covered in densely growing infrastructure. however, little attention is paid towards its environmental conditions. this leads to social problems such the absence of a clean water supply. the conditions of contaminated shallow groundwater and river water makes layer analysis of deep groundwater carriers (aquifers) necessary. this research aims to provide insight about deep groundwater potential, and determine the depths and locations of aquifers in the jakarta area, particularly for the benefit of the kapuk-cengkareng people. this research was conducted via well logging analysis. well logging is a geophysical method designed to find out the subsurface lithology of an area using its physical characteristics. the result from this research can be used to interpret that there are four deep groundwater layer zones with different qualities. good groundwater layers can be found in layers with good porosity and permeability. by analyzing the curves obtained using the well logging method, it can be known that most of the layers found in the wellbore are claystone with low resistivity and high gamma radiation. the resistivity value of the claystone layers is about 2-5 ω•m with 65-80 cps. there are several layers with high resistivity and low gamma radiation (sandstone) that has the potential to be an aquifer. this is reinforced by the sand layer with a right-leaning sp log curve proving that this layer is permeable. these layers have a 4-9 ω•m with 40-65 cps. these are mostly found as freshwater aquifers with (83-279) µ•s/cm ec, (7.61- 8.17) ph, and (56-188) mg/l tds.",well log devices,"Based on the well logging and groundwater chemical analysis performed in Kapuk-Cengkareng, West Jakarta, it can be stated that: 1. Well logging investigations using three methods (spontaneous potential log, resistivity log, and gamma ray log) have been able to describe potential layers as aquifers, based on the physical properties of the rocks. 2. Layers that are identified as fresh aquifers lie at depths of 122-126m, 94-100m, and 76-80m based on the samples tested. Aquifers at 108-113m are estimated as not freshwater aquifers. Knowing an aquifer’s potential can be used as a guide in groundwater exploitation. It should be noted that land subsidence will happen along with water exploitation. Aquifers at depths of 76-80 m and 108-113 m need to be identified first before exploiting them. 8.","dki jakarta, indonesia j.w. sihotang1, t.e. prayogi2, m.s.d. hadian3 1geological engineering of faculty, padjadjaran university, jalan raya bandung- sumedang km.21 jatinangor, sumedang regency 45363, west java, indonesia telp/fax (022) 842 88888 2groundwater conservation center, geological council, energy and mineral resources ministry, north jakarta, indonesia 3groundwater center, geological engineering of faculty, padjadjaran university, jalan raya bandung-sumedang km.21 jatinangor, sumedang regency 45363, west java, indonesia telp/fax (022) 842 88888 e-mail: sihotangjosua6@gmail.com",
22,Derive Poker Winning Probability By Statistical Java  Simulation,"this stem project is to simulate the poker probability. the game rule is to select three from four shared cards plus two own cards to form the best five to determine who can be the winner. in order to simplify the probability scenario, partial deck (9, 10, j, q, k, and a) are drawn to increase matching probability on higher ranked patterns such as four of a kind and full house. author used java random simulation method and conducted combination and conditional probability to calculate each player’s winning probability. author used a simple case study to derive the winning probability between two players. java random simulation is programmed to generate the random cards for both players. java programming can randomly duplicate the real poker scenario in a random way to distribute the cards to players randomly. authors compared the java simulated results against the expected probability derived based on combination and conditional probability. contingency table, chi-square proportions tests were conducted and confirmed that the java simulated probability could match the expected poker probability very well. this is a very successful stem project which has integrated java computer science and statistics/probability on the poker application.","java, statistics, poker probability",Authors have successfully applied both Probability and JAVA programming on simulating Poker Winning Probability. The JAVA simulation can predict the expected matching probability and players’ winning probability very well based on 1-Proportion tests. Partial Deck Poker was used to simplify the winning patterns and probability simulation. The ranking of the matching patterns has been changed from the Full Deck to Partial Deck as unexpectedly. Authors have created a Case Study and focus on Full House pattern scenario to demonstrate the JAVA Monte Carlo simulation. 179,"mason chen stanford ohs, palo alto, ca, usa mason05@ohs.stanford.edu","References

23,The Role Of Information Sharing On Supply Chain  Mahdie Sheikhi,"information technology (it), by facilitating and accelerating information exchange, enables organization and suppliers to become aware of each other’s needs and meet them in a timely manner which enhances on-time production philosophy. in this respect, a study was conducted with the aim of investigating the role of information sharing in drug supply chain using the views of experts in the field of pharmacy in tehran and hormozgan university of medical sciences as well as relevant organizations such as drugstores, hospitals, and drug deputies in 1392-1393. the findings revealed that 71% of the experts completely agree with the impact of information sharing on the integration of drug supply chain, and 45% agreed with the effect of information sharing on the efficiency of drug supply chain. also, 45% of the experts confirmed the effect of information sharing on the performance of drug supply chain. based on the results of inferential statistics, information sharing has a significant effect on the efficiency, integration, and performance of drug supply chain.","information sharing, drug distribution, integration, efficiency","Nowadays, information sharing is one of the vital aspects for the survival of different supply chain in the competitive world which has many advantages like increasing efficiency, decreasing inventory level at each time period, reducing totals costs of the chain, increasing certainty and decreasing uncertain conditions, as well as optimal use of resources and increasing productivity in all sectors involved throughout the chain. Considering its different sections, the drug supply chain is not exempt from this rule, and information sharing has a significant effect on its performance. Health and treatment supply chain, like supply chain management in a production system can lead to integration and coordination of processes, integration of information flow and coordination of planning processes. Information sharing is acquisition and dissemination of information relevant to planning and controlling supply chain operations. Information sharing is important for the efficiency and effectiveness as well as competitive advantage of the supply chain. The results obtained in this study show that most experts completely agree with the effect of information sharing on the integration, efficiency, and performance of drug supply chain and confirm its positive effect. According to the analyses of this study, managers and policy-makers of health and treatment sector should pay more attention to the role of information sharing in drug supply chain to improve its efficiency and performance and increase the quality of drug distribution .","hormozgan regional electric company bandarabbas , iran mahdiesheikhi@ymail.com maryam goodarzi(corresponding author) phd candidate,technology management department, faculty of management and economy, science and research branch,islamic azad university, tehran iran maryam.goodarzi@srbiau.ac.ir abozar nowrozinejad abozarnowrozinejad@yahoo.com saeede sheikhi saeede.sheikhi@yahoo.com",

26,Design For Manufacture And Assembly Of An Automated  Mirror Cutting Machine,"the research paper is based on the design of an automated mirror cutting machine for a developing country in a low level production system. current machines are very expensive. research on types of mirrors and car manufacturing industries was conducted on the internet, and also industrial visits to local car manufacturing industries. firstly the experiment was conducted in the lab and the force f=2.7kn required to break the mirror was found, this force was used to calculate the deflection y=39.44mm and bending stress= 305.5𝑁𝑁/𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚2. in the design process a cylinder of internal diameter d=75mm and a solenoid valve with flow factor 𝐶𝐶𝑣𝑣= 1.5 were selected. the maximum von mises in each of the tested components were below the yield stresses of the respective components hence this machine will not fail under normal operations. the maximum von mises stress= 2.948𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀 for the cutting wheel is less than the design stress= 18.387𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀, therefore the design is safe. in this project an arduino board will be able to read the input (pressure) by the use of the pressure sensors and turn it into the output, when the pressure from the compressor is great than 10.5bar the red led light will be turned on, then the operator of the machine will witch it off. above all the operator of this automated machine should be well skilled and wear goggles during the operation of the machine. an automated mirror cutting machine was designed within a budget of usd$4 221.34 and the machine can cut mirrors ranging from 20mm*20mm up to 500mm*500mm as stated from the objectives.","design, mobile",The paper was successfully done. An automated mirror cutting machine was designed within a budget of USD 4 221.34 and the machine can cut mirrors ranging from 20*20mm up to 500*500mm as stated from the objectives. The machine can also cut any shape of mirror. In the designing of the machine local materials were used so as to promote local companies by keeping the cost as minimum as possible and maintaining the quality. Improving a robot will help in increasing the accuracy and precision. A robot has an advantage over humans because it does not require sick leave and it does not affected by fatigue. 6.,"allen hondo university of zimbabwe, department of mechanical engineering, post office box mp167, mount pleasant, harare, zimbabwe allenhondo19@gmail.com tawanda mushiri university of johannesburg, department of mechanical engineering science, faculty of engineering and the built environment, post office box apb 524 bunting road campus johannesburg, south africa tawanda.mushiri@gmail.com charles mbohwa university of johannesburg, faculty of engineering and the built environment, post office box apk 524 auckland park, johannesburg, south africa cmbohwa@uj.ac.za",
27,Design For Manufacture And Assembly Of An Automated Wood  Cutter: Case For Developing Country,"wood is a renewable source of energy that is used by everyone and cutting wood is a vast problem in developing countries such as zimbabwe where manual methods are still been mostly used. zimbabwe has been facing electricity shortages to the extent of importing 1200 megawatts of electricity from zambia which is almost half of its peak demand. the aim of the paper is to design an automated wood cutter for cutting wood for domestic use. the objectives were to design a wood cutter which can cut wood of diameter 100mm, to design a wood cutter with an output capacity of (850-1000) kg per hour and to come up with a 3d prototype of the wood cutter. this machine will cut wood with minimum human influence. the objectives were achieved by performing an experiment to come up with the force required to cut the 100mm diameter round-wood and the torque generated was used to design and size the components of the machine. solidworks 2016 was used to calculate and estimate the bearing type and life, do the deflections and stress analysis to determine the weakest point on the machine. automation was done using the smt version 3.3 plc in connection with a shoe brake to protect the machine operator making the machine safer and user friendly. the fuzzy logic controller was used to monitor moisture content of inserted wood to prevent jamming of the machine. dfma principle was also used to optimize the machine cost without reducing the product quality. 221 proceedings of the 2nd european conference on industrial engineering and operations management (ieom) paris, france, july 26-27, 2018",,"The researcher acclaims that in the process of feeding wood, care should be taken before switching the machine on to check if it is in a good condition to function and the users are recommended to wear eye protection googles to protect themselves in the case of flying cuts. In sustaining the machine, the bearings should be greased after approximately every 5000Hrs of service and after use, the machine should be shut down, cleaned and covered to prevent dust from accumulating which may end up hindering the sight of the user which is un-safe.

28,Relating Strategy Of Core Company  To Type Of Analytics Used,"we argue that the process of learning from the data (that is: analytics and machine learning algorithms) is more complex in differentiators and innovators compared to cost leaders (see miles and snow et. al. 1978). given that the errors in prediction is as high as 80% on an average (see google pages), it is recommended that decision makers using analytics need to be of perceptive type (spend more time in analysis) and must avoid being judgmental (see mbti [4]) when the core company is following differentiation and/or innovation strategy. also we show that decision makers in cost leaders need to far less perceptive. we further argue that analytics applications are primarily done in production and finance for cost leaders, and primarily done in marketing and r&d for differentiators and innovators. use font size 11 for the abstract text. it should not be exceeding 200 words.","france, july 26-27",,"rrk sharma department of industrial and management engineering iit kanpur, kanpur, uttar pradesh india – 208016 rrks@iitk.ac.in",
29,A Heuristic Policy For Outpatient Surgery Appointment  Sequencing: Newsvendor Ordering,"sequencing and scheduling the surgeries in operating rooms (ors) can be a very important problem since (i) the duration of each surgery can be uncertain, (ii) surgeries are a great source of revenue and a huge source of cost for the hospitals because doctors, or staff, and surgery equipment are very expensive resources, and (iii) the satisfaction of patients and minimizing their waiting time is also a very important criterion. solving this problem can reduce the costs and increase the satisfaction of patients significantly, but at the same time it is very hard to drive the solution mathematically. even the sequencing sub- problem can be challenging if the number of surgeries are large. there is no known tractable optimal solution to this problem and in practice, mostly a heuristic policy which orders surgeries based on increasing duration variances, i.e. the surgery with the smaller variance is scheduled earlier, is applied. we propose a simple heuristic policy for the sequencing of the surgeries based on the newsvendor cost, and analyze it using a hospital data set as a case study. we show that this heuristic policy outperforms the ordering based on variance since it takes the asymmetry of waiting and idle costs into account. for the cases where the difference between the idle and waiting cost is large, which is the case in surgery sequencing, this approach achieves a better improvement in the total expected cost.","surgery sequencing, newsvendor, heuristic policy, panwar 1999","We have proposed a heuristic surgery sequencing policy based on the Newsvendor cost and compared it with the most common heuristics in practice, which order the surgeries based on the variance of surgery durations (VAR) and the one that asks all patients to be present in the morning to avoid any idle cost (NI). We have used both simulation and a hospital data to show that this proposed heuristic approach can outperform the available heuristics and have a considerable impact on the revenue of the hospitals as well as patients’ satisfaction. As a future work, it will be interesting to consider more complex scenarios in which multiple ORs are involved and the patients and doctors have time restrictions which will affect the ordering and scheduling and see how the NV heuristic can affect the cost reduction. In addition, any mathematical direction to show the optimality of NV ordering under specific conditions or deriving a performance guarantee for this scheme could be an exciting direction.","farzaneh mansourifard department of engineering & technology alzahra university tehran, iran farzaneh.mansourifard@gmail.com parisa mansourifard, morteza ziyadi, bhaskar krishnamachari ming hsieh department of electrical engineering university of southern california los angeles, california, 90089 usa parisama@usc.edu, ziyadi@usc.edu, bkrishna@usc.edu",
30,A Game Theoretic Approach To Newsvendor Problems With  Censored Markovian Demand,"this paper studies the newsvendor problem for a setting in which (i) the demand is temporally correlated, (ii) the demand is censored, (iii) the distribution of the demand is unknown. the correlation is modeled as a markovian process. the censoring means that if the demand is larger than the action (selected inventory), only a lower bound on the demand can be revealed. the uncertainty set on the demand distribution is given by only the upper and lower bound on the amount of the change from a time to the next time. we propose a robust approach to minimize the worst-case total cost and model it as a min-max zero-sum repeated game. we prove that the worst-case distribution of the adversary at each time is a two- point distribution with non-zero probabilities at the extrema of the uncertainty set of the demand. and the optimal action of the decision-maker can have any of the following structures: (i) a randomized solution with a two-point distribution at the extrema, (ii) a deterministic solution at a convex combination of the extrema. both above solutions balance the over-utilization and under-utilization costs. finally, we extend our results to uni-model cost functions.","markovian process, min-max, game theory, uncertainty set","We have studied the Newsvendor problem with the following challenges: (i) the demand is temporally correlated as a Markovian process, (ii) the demand can only be censored (i.e. partially observable), (iii) the distribution of the demand and the transition probabilities of the Markovian process are unknown and only upper and lower bounds on the transitions are given. We modeled this problem as a min-max zero-sum repeated game. We have proved that the worst-case distribution of the adversary at each time is a two-point distribution with non-zero probabilities at the lower and upper bound of the uncertainty set. The optimal action to minimize the worst-case cost-to-go can have be any of the following two formats: (i) a randomized solution with a two-point distribution at the lower and upper bound of the uncertainty set. If the over-utilization cost is larger than the under-utilization cost, higher probability is assigned to the lower bound to behave conservatively. Otherwise, higher probability is assigned to the upper bound to behave more aggressively and increase the chance of full observation. (ii) a deterministic solution at a convex combination of the lower and upper bounds of the uncertainty set, which also balance the over-utilization and under- utilization costs. Finally, we showed that similar results hold for a more general class of cost functions that are uni- model on the difference between the demand and the action.

31,Percentile Policies For Inventory  Problems With Partially Observed Markovian,"we study a set of inventory control problems with correlated demands over different time periods. on the other hands, we relax the assumption of fully observation of the demand at the end of each time period. in other words, we consider the case of partially observed (censored) demand in the context of a multi- period inventory problem. if the demand in a period is larger than the inventory level, we don’t observe the unmet demand. otherwise, the demand is fully observed and the leftover inventory is carried over to the next period. formulating the problem as a partially observable markov decision process provides a dynamic program (dp) to minimize the total expected cost. unfortunately, the corresponding dp is defined on an uncountable state space, with little hope for a computationally feasible solution. we present an interesting heuristic policy with a percentile threshold structure which outperforms the myopic policy and performs close to the optimal policy. we derive its performance guarantee and evaluate it using numerical simulations.","markovian demand, censored demand",,"demands farzaneh mansourifard department of engineering & technology alzahra university tehran, iran farzaneh.mansourifard@gmail.com parisa mansourifard, bhaskar krishnamachari ming hsieh department of electrical engineering university of southern california los angeles, california, 90089 usa parisama@usc.edu, bkrishna@usc.edu",
32,Relating Innovation Strategy Types To  Culture,in this paper we relate culture required to support innovation of a given type. it has implications for top management in terms of institutional building (while a research organization is being built from scratch); keep conflict (between research workers engaged in different types of innovation in the same organization) at manageable levels.,"innovation strategy, architectural","There are several implications of above for research organizations (industry and academic institutions). (a) When research organization is built from scratch, the above framework will be useful to top management to inculcate appropriate culture/values. (b) It will have serious implications for comparing individuals (research organizations: academic/industry) engaged in different types of research (for the purposes of distribution of rewards). (c) Also there will be serious problems in comparing different research organizations (typically Academic Institutes of Higher Learning) that are engaged in different types of innovation as above. It is known that many organizations are practicing explorative and exploitative innovations under same roof (USR) as opposed to in different roofs (UDR) (Singh, et. al., 2017). We expect that when exploratory and exploitative are done under same roof (USR) it will have a much larger culture clash, and top management (of these research organizations) has to devise approaches for resolving the conflict.","rrk sharma dept. of ime, iit kanpur, india, 208016 rrks@iitk.ac.in",

However, the industry will start to implement BIM as they saw the benefits that BIM will offer in construction projects. Furthermore, this research found out that the barriers of implementation of BIM at the moment is cost, training, and resistant to change. Based on this research, BIM need to be expose more to Malaysian construction industry. More future research should be done and focus on Malaysian construction to help benefit the industry. Furthermore, maybe the industry can evaluate the differences of using BIM and traditional method in construction project. The researchers can help to develop a framework for the implementation of BIM that will be suitable for the local construction industry by referring to the successful implementation in other countries.

37,Optimal Investment Decisions For Recovery From   Disruptions In The Decentralized Supply Chains,"in this paper, we investigate the optimal supplier’s and buyer’s reactions to supply disruption. upon disruption, the supplier loses the supply during the recovery period. given a delivery time contract between the supplier and buyer, the supplier can make an investment to decrease the recovery time to benefit both parties. if the supplier’s capacity is recovered after the delivery time, the supplier should pay a penalty cost to the buyer for each unit of lost sale demand and for the amount of time that the supply is delayed. also, similar to the supplier situation, the buyer incurs a penalty cost for each unit of lost sale demand and for the amount of the waiting time. because the supplier can decrease the recovery completion time, the buyer may offer a financial subsidy incentive to the supplier (sole sourcing with a financial subsidy incentive strategy) or source from two suppliers (dual sourcing strategy). in this study, we present two stackelberg game models to highlight optimal buyer’s and supplier’s decisions under the mentioned strategies we also find the financial incentives levels that would coordinate the two-party supply chain. finally, we compare the two strategies and characterize the buyer’s preference as a function of the model parameters. our work complements literature papers where they analyzed similar problems in the context of improving the suppliers’ reliability so as to reduce their chances of being disrupted. in contrast, we focus on the analysis of disruption recovery strategies. in particular, we investigate the role of building long term supplier relationships, through joint investment programs, in mitigating the impact of supply disruptions.",supply disruptions,,"nader azad sobey school of business, saint mary’s university, halifax, nova scotia b3h 3c3, canada nader.azad@smu.ca elkafi hassini, manish verma degroote school of business, mcmaster university, hamilton, ontario l8s 4m4, canada hassini@mcmaster.ca, mverma@mcmaster.ca",

Experts are consulted to understand the contextual relationship that exists between these drivers. Thereafter, Interpretative structural method is used as a tool to segregate the identified drivers into various levels. The result of ISM is presented in the form of directed graph. The graph shows that the drivers such as competitors action, product variety, product development, manufacturing process and number of suppliers are the main drivers that trigger complexity in supply chain. The result of this research can be extended to develop a conceptual framework and a quantitative model to measure complexity in supply chain.

42,Energy Performance Of Insulation Material In Houses And Buildings  Fayez Aldawi,"the residential housing sector consumes a significant amount of fossil fuel energy and thereby the sector generates a large percentage of greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to global warming and climate change. at present, approximately 39% of the total household energy used is required for space heating/cooling and a substantial amount of that energy is lost through the house walls. additionally, the floor space area and volumetric dimension of modern residential houses are increasing at a constant rate in most developed countries including australia. this additional space also requires energy for heating and cooling. therefore, the energy consumption for heating and cooling and greenhouse gas emissions will be increasing rapidly. a continuous upward energy consumption trend in residential housing sector worldwide will continue for years to come unless energy efficient and carbon neutral house wall systems are developed. one of the biggest challenges is to develop a smart house wall system made of thermal mass and insulation materials that can provide reduced energy needs for on-going heating and cooling with lower carbon footprint as most house wall construction materials are very energy intensive and have large carbon footprints. in order to develop a new energy smart house wall system, a study has been undertaken on thermal performance of two house wall systems (one is currently used conventional brick veneer house wall and other is an alternative house wall). the thermal performance (heat gain or loss through the wall) has been determined using computational modelling and experimental measurements. the economic analysis of both house wall systems has also been carried out. the effects of various climate conditions on these two house wall systems have also been determined. the findings indicate that the new house wall system provides better thermal efficiency than that of currently used conventional house wall. key words house wall system, thermal performance, energy efficiency, thermal mass, insulation material 312 proceedings of the 2nd european conference on industrial engineering and operations management (ieom) paris, france, july 26-27, 2018",,,"department of mechanical engineering and industrial engineering, yanbu industrial college, yanbu, saudi arabia",
43,Designing Ecofriendly Product-Service Systems (Psss)  Through Morphological Reasoning,"product-service systems (psss) have emerged in the last years as a means of integrating products and services in a coordinated manner, to deliver functional results that increase customer value while achieving environmental sustainability. nevertheless, the design and development of these systems is hindered by the absence of consistent and robust approaches that facilitate their implementation. the initial phases of the design of any solution, product or service oriented, are the vital stages where its key elements are determined. the research proposes a functional approach based on morphological reasoning to address the pss design concerns. the approach enables the integration of products and services while capturing the values and costs of their respective providers and receivers. life cycle modeling is then applied to evaluate the environmental impact of such a concept while a cost analysis portrays the economic benefits that can be achieved. a case study at an agricultural manufacturer demonstrates the use of the described approach and exhibits the advantages that can be achieved through a pss application.",,,"nicolas haber*, mario fargnoli** and massimo tronci*** department of mechanical and aerospace engineering faculty of civil and industrial engineering, sapienza - university of rome via eudossiana, 18, rome 00184, italy *nicolas.haber@uniroma1.it , **mario.fargnoli@uniroma1.it., ***massimo.tronci@uniroma1.it ahmad ababneh department of management sapienza – university of rome via del castro laurenziano 9, rome 00161, italy ahmad.ababneh@uniroma1.it",
44,Managing Customer Requirements For An Effective Service  Implementation In A Product-Service System (Pss),"the research addresses the management of customers’ requirements when implementing services in a product-service system (pss) context. services have expanded throughout recent years, yet their proper management and implementation remains a problematic matter for manufacturers. uncertainties and ambiguities characterize services due to their intangible nature on one hand and the customers’ subjectivities on the other. hence, when it comes to capturing the customer’s requirements for the pss’ services, traditional product design tools such as the quality function deployment (qfd) are limited for their accurate assessment and prioritization in order to develop an adequate service-oriented solution. to address this issue, the qfd is augmented using the fuzzy logic and the analytic hierarchy process (ahp) with the goal of reducing the above inaccuracies. the proposed approach is verified at a manufacturer in the medical field, where few practical pss investigations have been carried out despite their largely remarked potential.",,,"nicolas haber*, mario fargnoli** and massimo tronci*** department of mechanical and aerospace engineering faculty of civil and industrial engineering, sapienza - university of rome via eudossiana, 18, rome 00184, italy *nicolas.haber@uniroma1.it , **mario.fargnoli@uniroma1.it, ***massimo.tronci@uniroma1.it ahmad ababneh department of management sapienza – university of rome via del castro laurenziano 9, rome 00161, italy ahmad.ababneh@uniroma1.it",
45,Ways On How Digital Technology Can Streamline Supply  Chain Management Of Today,"todays’ world has resulted in extremely more complex traditional supply chains, where technological changes in the economy happen at a very fast pace. it is even made more complex due to emergence of digital technology, which is disrupting traditional operations which calls for all businesses to be digitally oriented. traditional business cannot unlock full potential of digital without reinventing their supply chain strategy. most companies understood the nature of these changes and are worked on introducing digital technology in their operations, however, an introduction of digital technology is not the answer for competitiveness advantage. we proposes an approach that overlooks at the fundamental differences between traditional supply chains that have been enhanced digitally and truly integrated, reinvented supply with fundamentally digital dna. it is proved in the study that for businesses to realize benefits of digital technology, businesses need to reinvent their supply chain strategy, reimagine supply chain as a digital supply network that units talent, information and finance and not only physical flows which has been the case with traditional companies. this solution further encourages companies to remain more connected, scalable and rapid than traditional supply chain management. this network enables people and data, as well as material, products and supplies to travel together across the extended enterprise. proceedings of the 2nd european conference on industrial engineering and operations management (ieom) paris, france, july 26-27, 2018",,,johannes mapokgole and thomas tengen vaal university of technology south africa,
46,An Assessment Of The Lean Deployment In The Mauritian  Textile Industry.,"lean manufacturing is a century old concept, initially developed by the toyota company. the word lean is ubiquitous but it can be diversely explained. the most common definition of lean is to be highly responsive to customer demand by reducing waste. the word lean manufacturing is synonymous with agile manufacturing, just-in-time or the toyota production system. the primary aim of lean is to reduce waste from the value stream of an organization and according to the pioneer of lean, taiichi ohno, waste can be categorized into seven categories. through the elimination of waste, lean manufacturing helps in increasing productivity, improving quality, as well as reduction of cycle time, all of which contribute to improved profitability of the institution. the aims of this study are to use lean methodologies to improve productivity through multi-skilling of operations, reduce waste from the value stream and decrease the dynamic cycle time, improve quality and reduce defects. through the survey questionnaire, the value streams of the mauritian textile industries were analyzed for non-value-added activities, and these wastes were subsequently reduced from the process. the main gains of this study were to help the mauritian textile companies gain competitive advantage and survive in this tough market.","lean, lean manufacturing, waste, productivity","& Recommendations 5.1 Conclusion Lean Manufacturing was designed for the automobile sector and was developed by the Toyota Company more than a century ago. Lean concept has since evolved and now numerous sectors such as the textile sector is adopting its principles as they aim to maintain competitiveness and survive the market. The survey questionnaire was used to gather valuable information from the respondents and also helped in formulation of few hypotheses. From the data obtained, the author found out that in the textile factory, lean is very beneficial; it helps in improving productivity, elimination of waste from the value stream, reduction of the cycle time, and improvement in Quality. 5.2 Recommendations Trainings should not be done within a training room, but rather it should be done on the Gemba, that is the workplace itself. The lean tools should be tailor made to suit a specific manufacturing operation and the personnel should be taught to actually use the lean tools as a means of improving their operations, rather than just using those tools for the sake of using them. Multi-skilling is another key pillar to ensure that productivity is improved through lean. Continuous improvement is another pillar for the industry to adapt to the lean philosophy. The top management should aim to motivate its personnel such that the focus remains on Lean Manufacturing. 5.3 Future scope for Research While Lean exists for over a century, it is still new in the Apparel Manufacturing Sector. Designed and perfected for the automobile sector, naturally it will require some modifications to prove its worth to the Textile Industry.

47,Using System Dynamics Approach To Examine The Impact Of  Erp And Lean On Manufacturing Performance,"the benefits of lean manufacturing and enterprise resource planning (erp) for manufacturing systems have been confirmed in the literature. however, there are continuing debates on the effects of these two systems on the manufacturing performance. given this trend, this paper aims at quantitatively examining these impacts and offers insights for the managerial implications. a system dynamics approach is used to illustrate how the performance changes under different scenarios using the real data of a case study at the textile and garment industry. the results highlight the role of lean manufacturing itself and lend support to the view of the inefficiency of erp system to manufacturing system. a suggestion to build erp-based lean system which erp supports lean production is made for industry managers to gain the benefits from the erp system.","erp, lean, manufacturing, performance","This paper has examined how the Lean and ERP system affect the manufacturing performance through a system dynamics approach. The textile and apparel industry was chosen as a case study and actual data was collected. The results highlight the role of Lean manufacturing itself and lend support to the view that ERP becomes a hindrance to Lean manufacturing when Lean practices are not properly integrated into the ERP system. Therefore, it is necessary for the companies to design an ERP-based Lean system and to build effective Lean practices before they can gain the benefits from the ERP system. The ERP-enabled lean system is still new and requires further research for this application. In future, it is suggested to examine the effects of ERP-based Lean system on the manufacturing performance when ERP is built to support Lean system. In addition, building on the previous research of the maturity model of ERP support for pull production, the SD methodology can be used to further illustrate how the performance changes under different scenarios of the ERP-based Lean system. Also, future research could focus on extending the analysis to other sectors to see how ERP-based Lean system is adopted in a particular industry.","thi phuong dung ho school of engineering rmit university melbourne, australia s3558438@student.rmit.edu.au arun kumar school of engineering rmit university melbourne, australia a.kumar@rmit.edu.au nirajan shiwakoti school of engineering rmit university melbourne, australia nirajan.shiwakoti@rmit.edu.au",
48,Optimal Collection Of Two Similar Products From N  Ordered Customers,"we develop and analyze a mathematical model for a specific stochastic vehicle routing problem in which a vehicle starts its route from a depot and visits n customers according to a particular sequence in order to collect from them two similar but not identical products. the actual quantity and the actual type of product that each customer possesses are revealed only when the vehicle arrives at the customer’s site. it is assumed that the vehicle has two compartments. we name these compartments, compartment 1 and compartment 2. it is assumed that compartment 1 is suitable for loading product 1 and compartment 2 is suitable for loading product 2. however it is permitted to load items of product 1 into compartment 2 and items of product 2 into compartment 1. these actions cause extra costs that are due to extra labor. the vehicle is allowed during its route to return to the depot to unload the items of both products. the travel costs between consecutive customers and the travel costs between the customers and the depot are known. the objective is to find the routing strategy that minimizes the total expected cost among all possible strategies for servicing all customers. it is possible to find the optimal routing strategy by implementing a suitable stochastic dynamic programming algorithm.",vehicle routing,,"epaminondas g. kyriakidis department of statistics athens university of economics and business athens, greece ekyriak@aueb.gr constantinos c. karamatsoukis department of military sciences hellenic military academy attica, greece ckaramatsoukis@sse.gr theodosis d. dimitrakos department of mathematics university of the aegean samos, greece dimitheo@aegean.gr",
49,Maximization Of Profits In Import Activities Through A  Hybrid Algorithm Based On Fictional Games With Multiple,"- an economy becomes competitive if it manages to optimize its logistics operations and to achieve a higher level of competitively is important to improve the foreign trade activities of a country. one of the most representative foreign trade activities of a country is the import activity, which ends up hindering the net gains if the adequate logistic optimization is not achieved. one way to address such optimization is through collaboration through game theory or fictional games. this article proposes a model to optimize and maximize profits of different players, taking into account the costs associated with the import of goods and scenarios with multiple suppliers eligible for the dispatch of the desired product. for this analysis, a hybrid algorithm composed of two parts is proposed, the first is responsible for determining the vendor and the international transactional conditions and the second is the solution of the fictional games. the results demonstrate that can be achieved economic benefits with the application of the model, on average the profits can be increased 22.2%, this was found after developing 100 problems with different parameters.","global supply chain, cooperative games, fictional games, simulation","The model of fictitious games has a notorious application in problems of real inventories, it becomes an opportunity for the decision makers to improve the efficiency of their logistics processes. The study consisted precisely in the analysis of global supply chains and whose objective is to formulate and validate an optimization model that minimizes the total costs in a chain of (n) retailers and (n) international suppliers. The research was developed in two stages, one for the operations between retailers and each of them with its market and another one to control the retail-supplier relations whose lead time is greater and merits planning organized according to previously established replenishment policies. The article was divided into four sections, the first section, section II was composed by a short literature review about the topic and the approached in the current literature. Section III contains the problem description, followed by section IV with the problem and model formulation. Finally, section V is the computational experiment and analysis of the model results. The model was based on fictitious games, which have proven effectiveness to improve the operative profit when diminishing the logistic costs. The model is effective regardless of the number of players available, in fact, by increasing the number of nodes, the system increases its performance; the average reached was 22.2%, with better savings for large sets. Cooperation between players presents important barriers despite showing economic benefits [14]. Apparently, the distrust between the parties, turns out to be the biggest barrier, so the biggest difficulty seems to be the formation of large coalitions. The solution of the model is composed of two fundamental parts; the first consists in determining the suppliers to be employed, considering those parameters of international transactions, and the second the design of the network of fictitious games. It is recognized then, the possibility of locality of the solutions, and not the global, in spite of that the model shows favorable results. It is noteworthy that the model is tactical, so its implementation may involve changes in rates. 150 170 190 210 230 250 270 290 0 5 10 15 20 Cost Sample for n=10 Regular Method Fictitious Games 366","suppliers adriana moros daza, msc industrial engineering department, universidad del norte, barraqnuilla, colombia hamburg university, iwi institute, hamburg, germany amoros@uninorte.edu.co carlos otero, msc. industrial engineering department, universidad del norte, barraqnuilla, colombia email: cjotero@uninorte.edu.co carlos paternina, phd in industrial engineering, marketing and international business department, universidad del norte. cpaterni@uninorte.edu.co","REFERENCES

51,Strategic Alignment Of Information Systems Flexibility With  Organization’S Operational And Manufacturing Philosophy:,"information systems (is) forms the nucleus of any organization. proper coordination, timely support and availability of information is essential for any organization to function properly in order to achieve its objectives, fulfill its strategic needs and sustain in the competitive environment of uncertainty. strategic information system (sis) is the new term adhering to the above concept which talks about alignment of information needs to strategic orientation of any organization. in this paper, we particularly talk about the various manufacturing strategies adopted by organizations and try to relate their characteristics to the type of is flexibility requirement to effectively support them. a literature review has been presented to identify the diverse organizational strategies and is flexibility dimensions. based on the review, arguments are made to build the theoretical framework and subsequent hypothesis.",is flexibility,"Organizational information systems forms the backbone of organizations. In this paper, we particularly emphasize on manufacturing organizations. The operating and production strategy varies for different groups depending upon the market segment they target, prevailing environmental conditions and company’s philosophy. The IS/IT system plays a significant role in supporting the organization’s strategic decisions and implement related operations. This work tries to draw a relationship between organizational and manufacturing strategy and kind of IS flexibity required to sustain in the competitive environment. The developed theoretical framework can be further empirically investigated for insights. 389","developing a theoretical framework somen dey and r.r.k. sharma department of industrial and management engineering indian institute of technology kanpur kanpur, india somen@iitk.ac.in, rrks@iitk.ac.in","References

61,"Predict Nba Team Winning Record  Mason Chen, Stanford Ohs, Palo Alto, Ca",": this paper is to build an empirical model to predict the nba team winning percentage based on their team offensive, defensive, and differential statistics by collecting historical data during 2003-2016. the raw data have been standardized through z transformation to remove mean and large variance bias effect. a multiple linear and step regression model was derived to predict the team winning record. after trimmed the insignificant regression terms, the derived model can predict team winning percent with r-square > 0.95. the multi-linearity concerns were addressed by looking at the variance inflation factor > 10. the redundant terms were removed to avoid over-fit risk. the regression model has identified 3-point percentage, turn over, and point per game most critical to the team offensive efficiency. this observation is consistent with modern basketball. in defense, how to defend the rebound and opponent’s field goal percentage are most critical. warriors’ 2015-2016 team record has been identified as an extreme outlier since their winning formula and team statistics are significantly different from the remaining 29 teams. the 2nd-order and interaction terms were added to enhance the prediction accuracy. the nonlinearity terms have indicated the complexity of the basketball team behaviors. defense field goal% * defense point per game was identified as the most significant interaction term. which may reflect the best defense is the start of a good offense. the model built based on 2003- 2016 data was further validated by the new season 2016-2017. this model can provide nba coaches and general managers how to draft, recruit, trade, or sign particular players to build a desired championship team based on the winning % formula. this methodology can be applied to nba play-off and other major professional sports like baseball, football, hockey, soccer. key words: regression, sports analytics, predictive model, statistics 1. introduction sports are big part of our daily life. every major city has their professional teams and local fans are very supportive to their local professional players as their heroes or role models. national basketball associate (nba) is the largest basketball organization. each year, each nba team is fighting for the playoff spot to win the championship. this paper would try to formulate what could be the most deciding factors to formulate how to build a championship team by analyzing historical team statistics. in major professional sports, the coach and team management are looking for ways to win more games to build their championship dynasty (such as celtics, lakers, bulls) in order to attract more fans to support their business. sports statistical modeling analytics1, 2 is becoming a critical approach to uncover the winning patterns hidden in sports data collected during each game played. the objective of this paper is to build a statistical model based on the past team offensive, defensive, and differential statistics in order to predict the nba 2016-2017 regular season team record. there are several research talks presented in mit sloan sports analytics conference3-5. these papers have used intensive analytics to uncover players’ playing patterns and help coach develop each player in order to create and maximize each player’s values to their specific team. our paper will provide the predictive methodology to be applied in the end of the regular season (april 2017). in figure 1, the authors have demonstrated the project scope of this paper: (1) use the 2003-2016 team offensive, defensive, differential statistics (input independent variables xs) to build a transfer function to predict the 2003-2016 team record (y); (2) use the same transfer function and 2016-2017 team offensive, defensive, and differential statistics to predict the new 2016-2017 regular season team record. figure 1 build predictive model 427 proceedings of the 2nd european conference on industrial engineering and operations management (ieom) paris, france, july 26-27, 2018",,"Authors have successfully built a predictive model which can predict the NBA Team Winning Record based on the top 9 team statistics records.

62,Choose Healthy Chocolate Mason Chen,"many people like eating chocolate, but may have some concerns on health risk, especially to people with cardiovascular or neurovascular diseases. the objectives of this paper are to use multivariate statistics to define a health biometric on choosing a healthy chocolate to patients with heart disease. chocolate, made from cocoa beans, contains flavonoids which contain antioxidants. flavonoids are the most abundant polyphenols in human diet. polyphenols have antioxidant properties which can prevent aging and is also beneficial to heart disease and diabetes patients. people with heart diseases should eat less of saturated fat, trans fat, sodium, and cholesterol. they should eat more dietary fiber. cocoa flavanols promote healthy blood flow circulation from head to toe. the heart, brain, and muscle depend on a healthy circulatory system. data has been collected on 20+ chocolate ingredient contents from 60+ different types of chocolate. multivariate correlation study has found that (1) strong negative correlation between cocoa and sugar, and (2) strong positive correlation between diet fiber and iron. most dark chocolate contains more cocoa, and less sugar. dietary fiber and iron are high in correlation because of the high cocoa percent. the above two correlations can be further explained by conducting the hierarchical clustering analysis on separating the dark chocolate, milk chocolate and white chocolate. the cocoa and calcium are the deciding factors to separate these three chocolates. based on chocolate science. these healthiest chocolate can actually help prevent heart disease. the same approach can be applied to help people with other diseases (cancer, diabetes...). in big data world, the multivariate statistics can help connect different data and explain the science in a predictive or/and empirical modeling.","stem, flavonoids, chocolate, statistics","This section will analyze the chocolate health index distribution and understand on how to choose better chocolate products, especially for patient with heart disease. The top four healthiest chocolates for heart disease were found in this paper. JMP software tools such as cluster analysis, correlation analysis, and distribution analysis were all applied to this project. Cocoa science, such as cocoa production, flavonoids, antioxidants, flavanol benefits, and the different types of chocolate, was learned throughout this paper. STEM approach is applied effectively to define the project scope by taking systematic scientific literature and engineering problem solving techniques.

63,Addressing The Challenge Of Lean Manufacturing Sustainment  With System Dynamics Modeling: A Case Study On Apparel,"lean techniques have yet to extend to the majority of manufacturers in developing countries where traditional work practices are dominant and cultural resistance to change is high. this research consists of a case study about a lean implementation at a clothing manufacturer in a developing country. production wastes are identified and appropriate lean techniques, namely total productive maintenance, kanban and supermarket pull, are used to eliminate or reduce them. the potential impacts on the manufacturing system are first assessed using a system dynamics model. the modeling results showed that system performance, in the form of reduced work-in-process, is improved by 34% on average starting immediately after the lean intervention, which was replicated by a similar trend in practice. a similar improvement trend was achieved with the actual implementation of the selected lean techniques. and since lean improvements are typically difficult to sustain over the long term, the system dynamics model is simulated over a 6 months period to ensure the achieved benefits are sustained.","lean manufacturing, system dynamics, apparel industry, kanban","and future work This paper illustrated the use of system dynamics modeling to simulate the impacts of a lean manufacturing initiative at an apparel manufacturer facing several efficiency challenges. The initiative targeted the reduction of WIP in the factory and the main lean techniques used were Total Productive Maintenance, Kanban and Supermarket Pull. An SD model was built to represent the production operation and assess the impacts of the lean intervention before implementing it in practice. Modeling results showed a net reduction in WIP of 34% on average over the first 3 months, and the actual lean implementation showed a similar decreasing trend and a net average reduction of 31% in WIP over the same period. The simulated improvement results were sustained for a simulation period of 6 months, and since the actual improvements in the factory showed a similar trend, only 3 months of monitoring were necessary on the factory floor to ensure the sustainment of the lean intervention. This shows the usefulness of system dynamics modeling for validating the long-term sustainment of lean implementations in practice. In conclusion, the study showed that SD modeling can be useful in testing the potential benefits of a lean intervention prior to actual implementation, especially for ensuring that the achieved benefits are sustained over the 448","manufacturing in a developing country marc haddad and rami otayek department of industrial and mechanical engineering lebanese american university new york, ny 10017, usa mhaddad@lau.edu.lb, rami.otayek@lau.edu","References

64,A Robust Optimization Approach To An Inventory System  With Emergency Lateral Transshipment,"this paper considers a single echelon inventory system with two retailers. we assume that when a stockout occurs at one retailer, its demand can be fulfilled from the other retailer. this policy is known as emergency lateral transshipment. using emergency lateral transshipments can be beneficial in order to improve service levels and to reduce system costs. this problem has been studied in the past using stochastic optimization, which needs full knowledge of the demand distribution. we assume that the distributional information on demand is not available, and it is only known that the demand in each period of a finite planning horizon takes a value in a known interval. the robust optimization is a powerful approach in dealing with this situation. in this paper, we first propose an inventory control model for emergency lateral transshipments. then, to deal with the uncertainty of the demand, we apply a robust optimization approach through formulating a robust linear programming model. moreover, resorting to duality theory, an equivalent robust optimization model is obtained which allow the solution to be delivered more efficiently.","inventory control, demand uncertainty",,"hamed tayebi department of industrial engineering karaj branch, islamic azad university karaj, iran hamed.tayebi@kiau.ac.ir soraya nemati department construction engineering and management, noore touba university, tehran, iran sneemati@gmail.com",

68,Proposal To Assess The Results Of Service Modularization,"service modularity has been attracting growing interest in the last decade, especially in how modularity can benefit service research and service providers. the application of modularity concepts in service context has been discussed as a way to achieve benefits such as increased variety, economy of scale, and decreased lead times. nevertheless, although the literature suggests that service modularity can positively influence service performance, the research on the evaluation of service modularization results is still scarce. the assessment of service modularity results is necessary for the application of modularity concepts in service organizations by demonstrating the potential of modularization in achieving benefits and improvements. therefore, this work proposes an approach to assess service modularity results based on the performance measures from modularity literature. these modularity performance measures should be selected and prioritized according to service characteristics, to assess the modularization outcomes. the results are valuable for proving the benefits related to service modularization and providing a holistic view of modularization outcomes. further work involves expert assessment concerning the proposal and fieldwork by simulating a healthcare service within a modular scenario.",modular services,"of this study. 5. Conclusions The proposed approach aims to address the gap concerning the testing phase of service modularization (the modularization phases were presented in section 2) since the literature on the assessment of modularization results is still scarce. The approach may be suitable for providing an overview of the service modularization effects, based on the analysis of performance measures. The results of this proposal may be valuable to identify improvements in the service provision and process. Conclusively, the results are useful for proving the benefits of service modularization and providing a holistic view of modularization outcomes, which may be valuable since the existing studies consider few evaluation criteria. Regarding practical contributions, the evaluation of modularization effects aims to support the development and implementation of modularity in service offerings, allowing project teams to assess whether the objectives pursued with modularization are achieved. Moreover, the results may help the practitioners in the decision-making process, demonstrating aspects that should be changed in the service offer/provision. The understanding of how to evaluate the modularization results as well as the demonstration of benefits achieved can also contribute to increasing the number of practical applications, which is also a research gap. Similarly to any other study, this one suffers from limitations. Firstly, the proposal scope is limited to the testing phase of modularization. Thus, further studies could consider other modularization phases (analysis of a service system, module and interface creation, and testing). The purpose application is also limited since it depends on the availability of organization's historical data, or even on an ideal value for comparing the current situation (modular) with the previous one (traditional scenario). Furthermore, the proposal would also be refined by the prioritization of performance measures using multiple-criteria decision analysis (MCDM) techniques or a combination of MCDM to assign weights and rank them accordingly. Moreover, this approach aimed to be generic, but by considering the service heterogeneity, some adaptations to service characteristics of specific service types (e.g., health services and logistics services) must be necessary, which may improve the service assessment. Finally, this study has limitations regarding the assessment of this proposal, because it was constructed based on theory. The next step of this work is the proposal assessment by experts in addition to its application with real data of health service modularization.

69,Process Centric Energy Modelling For Multinational  Manufacturing Corporations,"the industrial sector has traditionally utilised energy models and control and monitoring software for energy system evaluation and optimisation. a limitation of this approach is that the focus is primarily on manufacturing processes, not necessarily providing a comprehensive enterprise evaluation. the non- manufacturing activities require evaluation as the contributions of associated services such as technical building services, ict and other on energy demand continues to increase. this limitation is especially concerning for multinational manufacturing corporations (mmc’s) with business sites across various geographic locations, which can vary from manufacturing to warehousing to corporate. this research introduces the process centric energy model, which utilises business processes for energy evaluation and optimisation at mmc’s. mmc’s conduct business by enablement of business processes, which supports the energy evaluation of any business activity on any site. the concept and methodology of application of the process centric energy model is demonstrated with the procurement and electroplating business processes. the results demonstrate that business processes can be applied for energy quantification and optimisation of both manufacturing and non-manufacturing business activities, thus providing a comprehensive mmc energy evaluation.","process centric, energy models, 2015). however","To achieve the “below two degree” rise in global temperature, industry has to be a leader in the reduction of energy use and CO2 emissions. MMC’s encounter challenges to energy quantification and optimisation due to inherent complexity and the lack of a MMC specific tool. The desktop review of non-industrial and industrial energy models revealed its limited applicability to MMC’s, further affirming the need for a MMC specific energy model. The PCE model adopts a novel approach of business processes for energy evaluation and optimisation, as all MMC’s conduct business by employing business processes at various levels of functional enablement. The defining features of the PCE model are; reproducibility, genericity, ease of use, limited user data inputs and modelling time and comprehensiveness. The paper demonstrated the concept and methodology of application of the PCE model by application to the procurement and electroplating business processes. The results demonstrate that business processes can quantify and optimise the energy demand of both manufacturing and non-manufacturing activities of a MMC. However, this is the initial stage of development, with the fully enabled PCE model providing a holistic and integrated methodology for MMC evaluation and optimisation. Detailed application of the PCE model is expected in in the sequel paper, following the enablement and validation of the PCE model.

71,"Evaluation Of The Electric Bicycle As An Alternative Mobility  In The City Of Cuenca, Ecuador","in recent years, cities have been designed for vehicles and large infrastructures have been constructed for their circulation. as a result, vehicular congestion has significantly increased air pollution. consequently, intermediate cities are looking for more sustainable mobility options before they face road collapse. the objective of this study was to evaluate an electric bicycle as an alternative mobility option in the city of cuenca, ecuador. the analysis was done considering these four aspects: energy, environment, cost, and time. previous work published by local city government was considered to determine the most representative routes taking into account how people moves in cuenca. data collection was carried out with gps devices in order to propose a dynamic vehicle equation to determine energy consumption. the results were compared to light- duty vehicles operating on gasoline. hence, it was concluded that the electric bicycle is a viable option since it consumes less energy than a vehicle, emits fewer emissions, and costs less to cover the same distance. in near future, this information could be useful for local government to encouraged new mobility politics.","ebike, energy consumption","and Recommendations After conducting tests with an average route of approximately 6.5 km, it can be concluded that the bicycle is a feasible alternative for mobility in the city of Cuenca, Ecuador. In energy terms, it consumes 40 times less energy than the light vehicle, which in most cases is underutilized. Moreover, the electric bicycle uses 0.99 ± 0.004, while a vehicle equipped with an ignition combustion engine consumes 3.950 ± 0.227 kWh / route. This represents a 97% difference. Therefore, in this aspect, the use of the electric bicycle is certainly viable. In terms of carbon dioxide emissions, there was a significant difference between the two means of transport, even though an electric bicycle that charges its batteries from a thermoelectric plant emits 55 times less than a vehicle. Were the load to be made from a renewable source such as hydroelectric, as is the case in our country, the difference would be much wider.

Despite the importance of digitalizing the organization, several barriers such as a proper digital strategic plan, stakeholder engagement and lack of communication tend to inhibit the digitalization process. While some measures are said to be in place at the SA Private Organization, there is a worrying concern that these measures are not being brought to life as the digital strategy is only existing on paper. This unfortunate outcome could be attributed to the lack of leadership in executing the digital strategy at the SA Private Organization. Additional concerns at the SA Private Organization that inhibited the digitalization process is the flow of information among all stakeholders concerned regarding digital strategy such as employees, suppliers, customers and the management. 6 Recommendations based on the study In view of the research findings above, the following recommendations are provided: There is need for an urgent establishment of a digitalization committee at the SA Private Organization. This committee will spearhead the process of creating the right environment, the right tools and skills that are ideal for the digitalization process. This recommendation should be implemented by the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) at the SA Private Organization as soon as possible. The CEO at the SA Private Organization should set up a budget dedicated to the digital process. The budget should be established as a matter of urgency to avail resources that are required for this initiative. The CEO and the digital committee at the SA Private Organization should nominate a digital champion as soon as possible. The digital champion will assume the role of providing leadership to the organization on all digital matters. The establishment of a digitalization committee and the digital champion should be used as a gateway to stakeholder consultation. This initiative should be implemented by the CEO once a digital committee and a digital champion is nominated. Digitalization should be implemented in the interest of customers, employees, suppliers and shareholders for the SA Private Organization to achieve its business objective. 495","bertine mulombo mujinga and nita sukdeo school of mechanical and industrial engineering department of quality and operations management university of johannesburg gauteng, south africa nsukdeo@uj.ac.za bertinemul@gmail.com","References

77,The Reliability Of 43D Diesel Locomotives On The  Phalaborwa To Richards Bay Corridor,"the 43d diesel locomotives reliability performance en route on the phalaborwa to richards bay corridor is bound with challenges, despite the efforts of transnet soc limited, a south african biggest freight rail company responsible for transport within the country and across the borders. this case study uses a quantitative data analysis to investigate the reliability of 43d model of the locomotive rail freight operating within this route in the areas of maintenance cost, the effectiveness of the preventative maintenance, poor of asset availability., and to identify other operational management issues affecting this critical asset. the findings show that the inefficiency resulted from lack of training, inadequate maintenance schedules, and inappropriate location where maintenance is conducted. for remediation and mitigation purposes, it is recommended that proper techniques and preventive practices and schedules be implemented; good frequent training and performance assessment of the engineers and technicians be regularly conducted. in addition, a proper review of the asset service design, and the location of maintenance site be overhauled in the entire value chain.","availability, maintenance, reliability. 536","This paper reviewed the maintenance strategy adopted by Transnet. The result show that the strategy in use is good evident by 100% of the availability of components, mean time between failures of 2290 hours per year, mean time to repair of 0.12 hours. This depicts a good run to the failure maintenance strategy management system. The result further show that maintenance of components is not the only challenge but locations and minor service checks are part of the bottlenecks. Management, all Stakeholders, and design engineers need to ensure that locomotives designed conform with the railway system standards so that the locomotives will be able to perform daily operations without facing much difficulties resulting from either poor infrastructure, design and modelling specifications, or system configurations leading to critical maintenance issues, failures and downtime. 127 108 84 69 45 45 38 37 29 28 27 26 21 16 16 15 10 9 8 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 Noop Dynamic Air Pressure Not Starting Brakes Compressor Motoring Radio Oil Leak Vacuum Trips T/Motor Pipe Batteries Lights Shutdown Screen Wipers Telemeter Component Failure Pareto Analysis No. of Failure Cummulative % Cut Off 543","theophilus seletlo postgraduate school of engineering management, faculty of engineering and built environment. university of johannesburg tseletlo@gmail.com arnesh telukdarie postgraduate school of engineering management, faculty of engineering and built environment. university of johannesburg arnesht@uj.ac.za oliver nwauka postgraduate school of engineering management, faculty of engineering and built environment. university of johannesburg onwauka@gmail.com","References

78,Evaluating The Impact Of Total Productive Maintenance  Elements On A Manufacturing Process,"variety of process improvement tools exist; with each having a similar goal which is to enhance the performance of the business. total productive maintenance (total productive maintenance) is not only a maintenance strategy, but also a business improvement tool that companies use to remain competitive whilst improving customer’s satisfaction and reliability. the purpose of this research is to understand the impact of the tpm elements and their performance roles on the facility as a whole. a south african manufacturing firm in the process of implementing tpm is studied, to assess the progress made during the implementation process and the learnings that come with it. the data collected before and after tpm implementation at the company used in this case study is used to calculate the availability, performance efficiency, quality rate, and the overall equipment effectiveness (oee). the result showed that oee consistently improved its value above eighty percent (80%) from implementation. this improvement indicates the tpm pillars capability in enhancing business, underpinning these elements as crucial for a successful implementation.",,"The literature studied reveals that TPM implementation takes place through a series of steps known as TPM pillars or elements. TPM is a team based approach that thrives on the existence of these pillars [9]. The Japan Institute of Plant Maintenance defines TPM as an 8-pillar house or approach, but this number can change depending on the culture of the company, and organisational needs. TPM elements are very crucial for successful implementation. The elements selected for the implementation, need to address the challenges at the organisation. The TPM elements should be selected based on the organisational goals, in addition to allocating enough time for the actual implementation. Each of the TPM elements constitutes a crucial step to the overall success of the implementation of TPM, as each element addresses certain losses in the manufacturing process or the organisation to perform efficiently in all its departments.","mthetheleli joseph kwaso post graduate school of engineering management university of johannesburg, south africa jsphmahlatsi@gmail.com arnesh telukdarie post graduate school of engineering management university of johannesburg, south africa arnesht@uj.ac.za",

81,Corrosion Management: A Case Study On South African Oil  And Gas Company,"corrosion as a major environmental deterioration phenomenon affect material infrastructures and pipes. the associated risks, impacts, and failures affect production and reduces return of investments globally, which consequence despite the commitments of oil and gas industries results to spillage, injury, waste, hazard environmental degradation and damage evolution. a south african oil and gas company x in this case study is explored to highlight the risks associated with asset failures; its management due to corrosion and how to contend this mishap in the storage and distribution of refined oil, gas and allied products. using a mixed research approach, preliminary results indicate a below average asset availability, an indication that corrosion management techniques existing in the company does not achieve the protection intent due to poor preventive and mitigative activities in use. therefore, more desperate aggressive approach with approved corrosion policy, strategy, control standards and checks, plans, procedures and processes, structures, resources and professionals are required to manage corrosion in petrochemical industries.","corrosion, corrosion rate, remaining life",,"linda njomane faculty of engineering and the built environment university of johannesburg johannesburg; south africa lindanjomane02@gmail.com arnesh telukdarie post graduate school of engineering management university of johannesburg, south africa arnesht@uj.ac.za",
82,Application Of Value Stream Mapping And Monte Carlo  Simulation In A University Hospital,"this study aims at proposing a method that combines value stream mapping (vsm) and monte carlo simulation for identifying improvement opportunities in the flow of value, taking into account the inherent variability of the uncertainty sources. a cross-functional team was involved to draw the current and future state maps. moreover, leaders were interviewed to define the most critical uncertainty sources of the value stream, whose variability was verified through a thirty-day in loco data collection in a university-hospital. these variability data were inputted into the simulation model in order to comprehend how the uncertainty sources impact lead time. findings show that the proposed approach allows the identification of opportunities for improvement that are not taken into consideration in traditional application of the vsm, providing a more realistic condition of the current state.",lean production,"This study proposed the integration of a stochastic analysis of the VSM, taking into account the dynamic aspects usually neglected in the usual approach. The proposed method combined MCS and VSM and it is illustrated on a practical application in the flow of OPS from a public university-hospital. Implications of this study were two-fold: from the theoretical and managerial perspectives. First, from the theoretical point of view, the proposed method presented a complementary approach to those available in the literature to deal with variability in value streams. Such integration allowed the consideration of a more realistic scenario that drives more assertively opportunities for improvement. Furthermore, the qualitative analysis of the uncertainty sources criticality enabled the adaptation of the method to the contextual condition of the value stream under study. Second, concerning managerial contributions, the simple application of the proposed method might be appealing for practitioners, especially in companies whose value stream’s data are easily collected and pinpointed with the support of information technology. Moreover, the identification of the effects of the critical uncertainty sources on lead time provides managers means to systematically address variability in the value stream. Such improvements might entail other benefits than the ones usually foreseen by the usual VSM application. Among the limitations of this study, it is worth noticing that the method used to identify the uncertainty sources criticality can be further improved. The use of managers’ perception may be restricted to their level of understanding of the value stream, which mitigates the visualization of other potential uncertainties that are atypical, e.g. uncertainties related to non-cyclical decisions. The proposed method for considering the uncertainties also constitutes a limitation itself, since only MCS was used to consider the uncertainties and variability of the value stream. Thus, other methods that could have similar or better results were not addressed in this work. In addition, relatively to data collection, a used 30-day basis may have limited the analysis. Future studies that consider larger periods or samples could provide more extensive analysis and, hence, outcomes. Furthermore, it is suggested to apply the proposed method in different scenarios in order to extend its limits beyond the presented context.","leonardo bittencourt de souza, guilherme luz tortorella, and paulo a. cauchick-miguel department of production and systems engineering federal university of santa catarina - ufsc campus universitário trindade, caixa postal 476, 88040-970 florianópolis, sc, brazil leonardobittsouza@gmail.com, g.tortorella@ufsc.br, paulo.cauchick@ufsc.br daniel nascimento pontifícia universidade católica do rio de janeiro – puc-rj rio de janeiro, rj, brazil nascimentodaniel63@gmail.com",
83,Analysis Of Total Quality Management (Tqm)  Implementation In Small Medium Industries,this study is based on the large number of small and medium enterprises in the application of total quality management (tqm). the lack of standardization or clarity of the quality system used in smes is rather an obstacle for smes in maintaining the management system. the purpose of this study is to analyze the application of total quality management (tqm) to small and small industries in the food sector. after knowing the implementation result of total quality management (tqm) in small and medium industry in food industry. the methodology used is taking primary data with questionnaires. this study is an empirical study using population study techniques or often referred to as census techniques in the data. the resulting data will be processed by the method of structural equation model (sem). the limitation research is the small and medium industries in the food indutries.,(12 font) quality,"From result of analysis of Structural Equation Modeling (SEM), obtained result that model made is fit and acceptable. This can be seen from the value of GFI, AGFI, and RMSEA that have met the minimum limit. In addition, the value of AVE and some Construct Reability (CR) also meets the minimum value. From the calculation of CR, it can be concluded that: 1. Most of the IKM in Indonesia have implemented TQM. This can be seen from the high value of CR obtained. Of the 5 latent constructs, only 1 latent construct has CR value less than 0.70. 2. The largest CR value is in the Operational Factor, which is 0.976. This means that operational factors give results that small and medium industries have implemented quality management in their organizational processes. 3. The smallest CR value is in Non Financial Performance, which is 0.667. This means that the lack of because it has not been thinking until the development of new products because it is still focused on the development of the industry. From the results of the discussion in the previous chapter, the results show that small and medium industries spread across Java island for operational factors are very strong. This shows that in the activities of the organization, the organization directly and indirectly has been paying attention in terms of quality. In daily production operations, employee activities show concern for quality. This has an impact on the company's financial performance. But it does not have a significant impact on nonfinancial performance. This is due to the small and medium industries focus on the development of existing products today and have not come to think of new product innovation. Small and medium industries are still focused on the development of the company to improve in terms of revenue and production capacity. The current research focuses on small and medium industries that do not limit the field of industry it runs. From this research can be further research to be more specific in the field of industry such as food industry, or other industries where more focus on one business area. Then for the data obtained can be more so it will be more valid again the results obtained. This study still lacks in terms of the chosen method. Further research can use other methods that can produce more detailed and in-depth research. 7.

86,Real Options For Dealing With Uncertainty In Project  Management: A Case Study Of Moroccan Infrastructure,"the real options valuation allows for the consideration of possible options that are instinctively embedded in investment projects, in which the decision-makers have the flexibility to respond to the outcome of uncertainties. the business managers’ abilities to react to future market conditions tend to impact the value of the investment project by maintaining or improving the upside potential and limiting the downside loss. this process must be regulated by a decision analysis model, capable of capturing the particularities of each project. this paper presents a case study of a moroccan infrastructure project, that had already undergone an evaluation, and its purpose is to review this project’s application and valuation of real options. the paper fully addresses the gaps of the previous study, provides a corrected model for an improved valuation of this project and a suitable use of real options. it also illustrates its application and analyzes the obtained results.","project management, investment project, decision analysis","Real options are a way of valuing infrastructure projects, which involve irreversible investment decisions subject to uncertainty. Whereas discounted cash flow analysis is based on fixed estimates of costs and revenues and a predetermined development scenario, real options focus on project flexibility (e.g., being able to defer starting a project, or conversely, to accelerate its development, to contract ...). Early applications concentrated on flexibility to overcome uncertainty on financial parameters and tended to ignore uncertainty on technical parameters (such as recoverable reserves) [10]. The flexibility to revise managerial and operational decisions over time in response to uncertain market conditions can significantly increase the value of a project [11]. Thus, an option has value because there is market uncertainty related to the underlying asset. The idea is that once the uncertainty clears, the option may be exercised and the project initiated, expanded, scaled down, or contract accordingly. The option lets us take advantage of the upside while avoiding the downside [4]. The evaluation of the desalination plant of the sea water in Agadir using the chooser option and the real options methodology provided a much sophisticated and elaborated analysis for taking investment decisions than the early study using the abandon option, that drags along a bad reputation and an unrealistic application. This framework covered not only the valuation of real options but also the organizational, strategic, and controlling aspects necessary to apply real option valuation accurately. In particular, this paper focused on uncertainties underlying any real option and their added-value to the project’s valuation. Uncertainties are being used not only to identify options but also to link the interaction of uncertainties with the interaction of options [12]. More importantly, the real options approach is a state of mind, an ability and a desire to detect decisions that create opportunities and protect against setbacks, by acting on them to create value in the future and profit of the company. For a full review of the project we would need to consider other uncertain factors, for example, the project’s estimation of the volatility factor, that might trigger a substantial alteration of the valuation’s results.","project jihane gharib1, abdelaziz berrado2, loubna benabbou1 1 team moad-scm, 2 team amips, department of industrial engineering, mohamadia school of engineers, mohammed v university, rabat, morocco jihane.gharib@gmail.com, berrado@emi.ac.ma, benabbou@emi.ac.ma",
87,5S In Container Terminals – A Framework To Reduce Container Demand Uncertainty,"5s is a popular workplace organisation method which uses five japanese words: seiri, seiton, seiso, seiketsu and shitsuke. this is to describe how a work place is to be organized to improve effectiveness and efficiency. 5s is applied in many fields such as fmcg, health care, banking, automobile industry etc. container terminals around the world are in urge to gain competitive edge over their competitors and every second of their daily operations have become crucial in current business arena. this is the reason why the major ports worldwide are focussing on various continuous improvements techniques. the purpose of this research is to develop a framework that covers the two aspects of demand uncertainty for imported containers and addressing it with a special container stacking pattern and appointment system (pre gate arrangement). this sorting framework in container yard based on the 5s method also improves the turnaround time (tat) of the trucks entering the terminal and improves value for their stakeholders eventually.","turnaround time, free period, anchorage time, manoeuvring time","In truck turnaround time, it was found that the turnaround time was more for trucks with pick up laden mission, which further raised the overall truck turnaround time. The increased turnaround time was because of the re-handling of other containers in the same stack. In fact, it is not uncommon to require 3 re-handles for each import delivery. The proposed framework would reduce the uncertainty of container demand to a great extent. It also addresses the uncertainty that happens in two different ways i.e. demand for laden containers that has reached its free period end and demand for the containers that has not reached its free period end. First, you can setup a small ‘pre-gate’ a mile ahead of your main gate, and capture the information on the needed import container there. This can give you maybe 15 minutes more time, which won’t help much on total re- handles, but you can start re-handling sooner thus reducing the time the truck spends inside the terminal. Second, there may be patterns on pick-up time of imports you can find. For example, you may be able to ‘guess’ the pick-up day depending on the dwell time, the bill of lading, and the trucking company supposed to pick up the container.

It is presented a framework for analysis of the solar industry that incorporates the effects of the perceived customer value on the customer. Although this paper not presents the effects of customer value on solar supply chain, the simulation model could be supported this analysis. Also, a similar strategy could be used to analyse others marketing policies, using the simulation approach proposed here.

92,The Influence Of Leadership On Innovation:  A Case Study In  The Telecommunications Industry In South Africa,"leadership is the engine of an organisation and innovation is recognised as a critical success factor for an organisation’s survival. leadership is at the core of creating an innovative culture within an organisation, and employees play a vital role in the execution of innovative outputs. the purpose of this research was to examine the relationship between leadership and employee innovation and to provide an inventory of leadership behaviours that promote innovation at an individual and organisational level. through examining literature, the research will present a list of characteristics and values that are required to cultivate and promote innovation. these characteristics were studied by means of a case study in a telecommunications organisation to establish whether the organisation embraces innovative behaviour. the scope of the literature review examined the different leadership characteristics required at the individual, group, and organisational level. data in the case study was collected by means of a questionnaire and analysed to provide recommendations to the organisation on ways to improve the cultivation of innovation within their workforce.","creativity, innovation, leadership, control","The first research question was to identify which characteristics influence innovative behaviour in an organisation at an individual and organisational level. Through literature review the organisational characteristics that promote an innovative culture in an organisation were identified; and it was found that creativity and innovation in an organisation can be influenced by multiple variables. From the literature findings, it was established that there are four organisational values that cultivate and promote innovation within an organisation, namely strategy, structure, support mechanism, behaviours that support innovation, and communication. It was established that if these determinants are not supported within an organisation, innovation will not prevail. The influence of each determinant on innovation was analysed through an empirical study to determine if these values are being adopted within a company in the telecommunications industry. The study was limited to an organisation within the telecommunications industry in South Africa, and this presents an opportunity to extend the research to other engineering sectors. Other disciplines, such as Finance and Human Resources, may also benefit from the work by evaluating what constitutes innovative behaviour within the particular field of knowledge. The findings may be employed by the telecommunications industry in South Africa to guide leaders within such firms to promote and instil innovation in their employees towards competitiveness and business sustainability.","pascalis adams, hannelie nel and annlizé marnewick postgraduate school of engineering management faculty of engineering and the built environment university of johannesburg auckland park, johannesburg, south africa pascalisadams@gmail.com, hannelien@uj.ac.za, amarnewick@uj.ac.za",

The model optimizes the SCN, consisting of manufacturers, assemblers and customers with the overall goal of minimizing the transportation costs for the concerned periods while balancing the assembly lines in assemblers in order to minimize the total cost of setting up stations concomitantly. 5.0. Future The work presented is the first phase of the research which continues with the application of the model to real-life data to show its utility after which recommendations for its deployment will be made. The model is expected to minimize the number of stations to be opened in the assembler as production rate increases which translates to reduction of activation costs of stations. In addition, enforcing a maximum limit of cycle times for all stations will ensure increase in the throughput rate of the line, that is, minimizing the idle time, thereby translating to increased line efficiency. Also, the overall transportation costs along the SCN network (Manufacturer – Assembler and Assembler – Customer) will be advantageously reduced. 713","1*raji, ibrahim. o. and 2rossi, tommaso center for supply chain, operations & logistics management liuc - università carlo cattaneo castellanza 21053 (va) italy 1iraji@liuc.it; 2trossi@liuc.it","References

This study defined the most appropriate eco-driving techniques based on the route by maintaining similar conditions such as the driver, vehicle, and schedules. Each proposed technique showed a reduction in fuel consumption after the post-training phase (Idling 36%, hard braking and accelerations 35.1%, constant speed 51.82%, inertia 11.45%). The rpm regime increased by 3.22%, this kept the revolutions within the recommended range for an optimal consumption based on the engine torque-power diagram. When all the techniques were used in conjunction, a decrease in fuel consumption and cost of 8.3% was achieved (See Table 10). This research showed that it is possible to reduce the fuel consumption by following specific vehicle driving recommendations as follows: - Reducing idling time when the vehicle is parked (Huang & Peng, 2016). - Selecting the correct gear based on the road's slope (Pañeda et al., 2016). - Checking the tires' pressure periodically. - Avoiding hard acceleration events, especially when there is traffic or when the road is not suitable for such changes in speed. This recommendation also applies to braking events. - Keeping a constant speed is the most crucial recommendation when the car drives up to 70 km/h approximately (El-Shawarby, Ahn, & Rakha, 2004). - Taking advance of the vehicle's inertia depending on the road's conditions.

105,An Investigation Of Deployment Strategies Of Advanced  Process Control Systems,"this research is intended for process control practitioners, plant decision-makers and process control technology leaders that are considering implementing advanced process control (apc). an understanding of apc is developed from an introductory level a definition, its purpose and how apc relates to process control and the enterprise. three types of apc techniques are adopted for elaboration on capabilities and applications. the applicability of the selected apc technologies is investigated based on the type of manufacturing industry. this investigation is conducted as there are varying approaches to the implementation of apc technologies in each of the selected manufacturing sectors. the key challenge is deciding on the best fit process control system. various industry sectors are explored further to gain an understanding of the inconsistencies in the apc selection approach and to test the proposed decision framework. this research proposes a framework that guides the decision-making process that ranks the anticipated risks to be addressed for the considered apc technique to positively contribute towards the profitability of the enterprise. this framework forms the basis of the deployment strategy for apc. hypothetical scenarios are defined to test the decision framework and validate its appropriateness. an impression on how various manufacturing sectors perceive process automation is given, together with a process that considers both qualitative and quantitative factors into the strategic decision-making process for the best apc technique.",,"Literature reveals inconsistencies in how APC projects are decided upon and their subsequent implementation. Furthermore, the barriers that prevent deployment of process automation are explored as these impact the extent of implementation of APC. This research investigates pre-deployment factors and proposes a decision making framework that could assist the implementation of an APC based project from a technology selection perspective. A decision framework is proposed that can be adopted in prioritizing the risks of APC projects using AHP to select the best suited APC technique. This investigation is based on documented literature pertaining to APC that is applied in various industrial sectors, specifically power generation, petrochemical refining and pharmaceutical industries. The business environment challenges are depicted through hypothetical scenarios that are formulated using morphological analysis. The presented decision framework is intended for use as a high-level tool that considers all stakeholders which are plant operations, management, engineering, maintenance and supplier.

107,Simulation Based Study Of Safety Stocks Under Short-Term  Demand Volatility In Integrated Device Manufacturing,"a problem faced by integrated device manufacturers (idms) relates to fluctuating demand and can be reflected in long-term demand, middle-term demand, and short-term demand fluctuations. this paper explores safety stock under short term demand fluctuations in integrated device manufacturing. the manufacturing flow of integrated circuits is conceptualized into front end and back end operations with a die bank in between. using a model of the back-end operations of integrated circuit manufacturing, simulation experiments were conducted based on three scenarios namely a production environment of low demand volatility and high capacity reliability (scenario a), an environment with lower capacity reliability than scenario a (scenario b), and an environment of high demand volatility and low capacity reliability (scenario c). results show trade-off relation between inventory levels and delivery performance with varied degree of severity between the different scenarios studied. generally, higher safety stock levels are required to achieve competitive delivery performance as uncertainty in demand increases and manufacturing capability reliability decreases. back-end cycle time are also found to have detrimental impact on delivery performance as the cycle time increases. it is suggested that success of finished goods safety stock policy relies significantly on having appropriate capacity amongst others to support fluctuations.",,"and Future Work This paper explores safety stock under short term demand fluctuations in integrated device manufacturing. The manufacturing flow of integrated circuits is conceptualised into front end and back end operations with a die bank in between. A model of the back-end operations of integrated circuit manufacturing in the context of short-term demand fluctuation is developed in this study and implemented using a simple assembly load logic. Simulation experiments based on three scenarios, namely a production environment of low demand volatility and high capacity reliability (Scenario A), a manufacturing environment with lower capacity reliability than scenario A (Scenario B) and an environment of high demand volatility and low capacity reliability (Scenario C). The analysis of simulation results confirms a trade-off relation between inventory levels and delivery performance in all cases and scenarios evaluated. This trade-off relation varies between the different scenarios. Generally, higher safety stock levels are required to achieve competitive delivery performance as uncertainty in demand increases and manufacturing capability reliability decreases. In addition, capacity utilisation is found to be key. The results indicate that the success of the Finished Goods safety stock policy relies on having the sufficient capacity to support swings in production. In addition, the influence of the back-end cycle time of the product shows a detrimental impact on performance as cycle time increases. The model presented considers the uncertainty in both demand and capacity reliability within the back-end cycle time. Statistically, it is more likely that this uncertainty manifests more frequently if the back-end cycle time is longer. In other words, a manufacturing system with shorter back-end cycle time is able to react quicker to sudden changes in the demand requirements by adjusting the assembly loads. Long manufacturing cycle times are regarded as one major challenge given the impossibility to react to sudden changes in demand. The results are indicative of the manufacturing flow studied, more so the simple assembly load logic","oliver alcalde fernández and funlade sunmola school of engineering and technology university of hertfordshire college lane, hatfield al10 9ab uk oliver.alc.fernandez@gmail.com, f.sunmola@herts.ac.uk","References

108,Simulation Modeling For Productivity Improvement Of A  Production Line: A Case Study,now a days most production lines of the industries are designed and equipped with necessary machineries initially which cannot meet the rising demand though their capability increase. the aim of this research was to find solutions towards solving the bottleneck and rectifying the line to improve productivity. this study is based on analyzing an existing production line in meghna group of industry bottle production line which product has a rising demand. the processing time of different workstations with their capacity were collected as necessary data. simulation was chosen as a tool to analyze the line as it is a frequent technique towards solving problems. the statistical analysis was done through microsoft excel software. the existing simulation model was developed using process oriented simulation software arena to find out the bottleneck of the production line. also a modified model was proposed which reduces 14.11% waiting time and increases 4% productivity along with increment in profit to cope with rising demand.,"simulation, production line, bottleneck","In this research, bottleneck areas of existing production line were found out to pave a way to rectify the model to increase its productivity with the application of simulation. The developed model was an ARENA simulation model of a Bottle production line in a selected industry. Through the simulation of the existing line a large bottleneck area was seen in the Manual Cap Sealing workstation which was later replace by an automated Bottle Cap Sealing machine which reduced the average waiting time and increased the productivity. Along with that cost and revenue were calculated from the collected data which denote that with the reduction of cost in the line, the profit has also increased at a huge amount. Despite all this works, some limitations still exists in the line. Simulation study was conducted with an assumption of not considering worker fatigue and machine breakdown and there was no practical application of the proposed model. Besides, for the terms and conditions applicable for the industry it was not possible to get the exact cost and revenue related data so an average value was collected and used. Justification of proposed model by applying it in a practical manner can be further approach of future research in this field.","subrata talapatra department of industrial engineering and management khulna university of engineering & technology khulna, bangladesh sub_ksy@yahoo.com rahnuma tarannum department of industrial engineering and management khulna university of engineering & technology khulna, bangladesh rahnumatarannum20@gmail.com jannatul shefa department of industrial engineering and management khulna university of engineering & technology khulna, bangladesh jannatshefa23@gmail.com",
109,Advanced Generation Niosh Automatically Deployable  Rollover Protective Structure (Autorops),"safety is the most important aspects in every society and it is a major issue in the agricultural industry, which continues today as one of the most hazardous industry in the world with comparatively high fatality rates. hundreds of farmers die each year due to tractor rollovers despite the fact that a highly effective safe guard is available in the form of a rollover protective structure. the use of rollover protective structure on farm tractors has attributed to saving numerous lives and has prevented many human injuries over the years. many tractors come with the rops factory installed; however, many rollover protective structure were apparently removed by the tractor’s owners due to the high clearance zone, which may cause the rollover protective structure to hit damage produce located on low hanging tree branches, while working in an orchard and that may cause farmers to lose money. the new niosh third generation autorops prototype with low clearance zone was structurally simulated and analyzed using a computer-aided design program ansys® to insure the compliance with the society of automotive engineering j-2194 standard requirements. the results proved that the third generations of the autorops did absorb all applied loads in sequence and thus satisfied the j-2194 test requirements.","tractor, rollover, autorops, clearance zone","and Recommendations All of the loads were applied in sequence on the AutoROPS. The results met the requirements of SAE J-2194 standards; the AutoROPS absorbed all of the required energies and did not intrude into the clearance zone. Since the fixed inside post for the third generation AutoROPS had smaller tube size, the ability of that posts to withstand the sequence of loading was questionable, but the results came positive, the post did withstand the applied loads. This study also focused on using finite element analysis to analyze the stresses on the base. The results were positive and determined that the base did take the entire load being applied to it. Maximum stresses found on bolts were way below the minimum proof yield stress for the grade 8 bolt. The base did show a good factor of safety during loading sequences. The redesigned version of the third generation AutoROPS has 10 inches of overlapping room between the posts, which met the design criteria and gave enough room for the spring to fit. This design also allows the deployable post to retract all the way down to the base of AutoROPS and to have a height of 39 inches only. First and foremost, this study showed that the deployable AutoROPS is a novel idea to protect tractor operator in the case of a tractor rollover and to meet his need of having a low clearance zone while operating in the farm. Although the third generation AutoROPS has proven effective in this research, it is necessary to continue research on future improvements of the AutoROPS. The possibility of saving even more lives makes the continued research worth looking at. 6. Recommendation for Future Work The need for better analytical study in designing the AutoROPS becomes very important because the test standards were basically a pass or fail criteria. Since the third generation AutoROPS was a new design, there are other criteria that need to be studied. An example would be how the latching mechanisms would perform during loading and how it can be fitted in the overlapping area between the two posts. Another important subject that needs to be looked at is the deployment time required for the outside deployable posts to be deployed and still meet the necessary standards. Also, aspects of the spring criteria such as size, diameter and the release strength needed to be determined. Last but not least, the material properties like the strength and weight, and the cost of building the prototype need to be researched further.

110,Industry Academia Knowledge Bridge: A Case Study  Manasi Ghamande,"weighing mechanism is critical in any industry. error causing excess material shipped is loss to industry. less material shipped is loss to customer, leading to complaints, contract review and legal non compliance. chemicals in this case are costly& corrosive. reported complaints are erratic behavior of weighing balance because of mismatch in industry and customer readings, beyond tolerance. complaints are responded by shipping the difference quantity. small quantity shipments are risky, because of corrosive chemicals& results in quality, environment and safety -qes risks. deviation causes considered are drift, aging, mechanical variations, moisture, wind, temperature, container variations, &human factor. the problem is variance attributes and multivariate analyses are non- conclusive. the relationship between drift, calibration errors and reported mismatch is non-conclusive. smart incubation center, of aadishakti foundation has solved this problem, bytest setup validation and mismatch identification at industry and at customer end defining, mutually acceptable techno- commercial solution, qes guidelines for customer education. the case is based on primary data obtained from observations during the set-up validation &techno-commercial solution, resulting in academia-industry knowledge bridge, by an intern. improvements achieved are development of standard operating procedure, acceptance norms, customer education, eliminating qes risk and complaints. key words qems risks, setup validation, repeatability & reproducibility- r & r studies, smart incubation centre 1. introduction the electronic indicator, reliable load cell with equilibrium correction, compensation for various errors and drift have made weighing easy. the weighing set up in the case, is validated by standard weights. compensation results in reliable & accurate results. compensation settings are protected by a password to ensure tamper proofing. yet, complaints of erratic behaviour of weighing machine are reported as a problem. since inception, number of successful projects related to problem solving, system development through iso 9001, iso 14001, iso45001, iso 27001, iso 22001, sa 8001& zed certifications; people, products and process improvisation are being executed for industry, academia, society and ngo, by smart incubation centre of aadishakti foundation. the problem, although complex is taken up, to mentor the intern and build an academia industry knowledge bridge; thereby, reducing impact on safety and environment, thus also contributing to society. 3215",,"In brief this study resulted in a knowledge bank, and knowledge build for the industry and customer. This eliminated quantity mismatch complaints and noncompliance in contract review, & QES risks. Simple technique like setup validation, agreeing on acceptance standards, Repeatability & Reproducibility study, customer education, risk mitigation by SOP development is proven very effective. With help of trained student, a complex problem having negative impact on organisational image, legal, safety and environment concern is solved. Role of the intern is to carryout studies for multiple observations and data collection to identify root causes. The intern has also developed the knowledge bank & shared it during training to convince the customer& educating the customer for the various mismatch attributes to help them in refining the acceptance norms. The solution eliminated the QES risks associated with the complaint resolution by small quantity shipment. Carrying out experiments at site and various locations is very difficult by the industry staff, due to production pressure. Knowledge built, such as dedicated SOPs - Standard Operating Procedures development and process design and validation are contribution of trained student & academia with mentoring. This is feasible due to better research acumen and lack of production targets. In brief all three student, Industry and Mentors have together contributed to resolve the problem and ensure system compliance. Such Industry Academia knowledge bridge is proven very effective to solve a complex problem.

111,Models Of Performance Evaluation Of Spare Parts Inventory  Management,"the supply chain of spare parts is the intersection between two different organizations: the supply chain and the after-sales and maintenance services. the traditional configuration of organizations of spare parts management, is the decentralized management configuration, causes the lack of information sharing between technicians, unshared inventory, and ultimately, the logistics flow of deliveries and supply time significant which can engender costs important and low quality of service. in order to mitigate these effects, several maintenance organizations have directed towards centralized management of a supply chain of spare parts. for example, some authors have attempted to define improvement paths in terms of models to satisfy performance criteria such as hybrid methods for demand forecasting and approaches for the selection of management methods based on inventory management criteria. in addition, other authors are directed towards the integration of risk management in forecasting and management of the stock through the probabilistic models. among these models, the graphical models are the most used for example the bayesian networks and petri nets. this work involves developing a comparison of the models and approaches that deal with the forecasting and performance evaluation of spare parts inventory management.","spare parts, management, prediction, performance, risk",,"oumaima bounou*a, abdellah el barkanyb and ahmed el biyaalic faculty of sciences and techniques, mechanical engineering laboratory, sidi mohammed ben abdellah university, fez, morocco e-mail: a oumaima.bounou@usmba.ac.ma, b a_elbarkany2002@yahoo.fr, c biyaali@yahoo.fr",
112,Optimal Vendor-Buyer Cooperative Inventory Policy For  Order Size Dependent Transportation Cost,"in a vendor-buyer cooperative inventory system several factors including planned shortage, controlled sales price, shipment size and frequency affect the total profit. though a larger order size reduces the number of shipments, it conversely increases the lead time and transportation cost. on the other hand, planned shortage of items reduces the buyer’s storage cost; at the same time it increases the backorder cost for the buyer. by controlling sales price, the buyer can affect the rate of market demand which eventually affects the total profit. the problem is to find an appropriate sales price, backorder quantity, ordering size and frequency that lead to maximum joint total profit. considering all of these aspects for an imperfect production system, this paper presents two joint total profit models for two different cases depending on the location of the quality inspection. a search approach, based on random walk with random restart method, is used to solve both models for obtaining suboptimal solutions. a numerical instance is presented to illustrate the solution approach. the numerical instance presents that the solution noticeably differs when quality inspection is done by the buyer instead of vendor.",planned shortage,"A joint economic lot size (JELS) problem with imperfect production, pricing decisions and planned shortages is presented in this paper, when the lead time and transportation cost are significantly correlated with the order size. The objective of the problem was to maximize the joint total profit, by optimally determining the order size, unit selling price, backorder quantity and number of shipments. The problem is mathematically formulated for two cases and solved heuristically. A closed form solution for order quantity and unit selling price is not on hand due to lack of global concavity. The solution method follows derivative approach for finding optimum number of shipments and backorder quantity. Whereas, the order quantity and unit selling price were determined by a search heuristic namely, random walk with random restart. An efficient heuristic development is the potential extension of this research. Depending on the instance, a case based concavity in a certain solution range can lead to the finding of a local optimum solution. 805","sharon orengo, md. shahriar j. hossain and bhaba r. sarker department of mechanical and industrial engineering louisiana state university, baton rouge, la 70803, usa sharon.orengo@etu.univ-lyon1.fr, mhoss25@lsu.edu, bsarker@lsu.edu","References

114,Skills Development By Training: Case Of  The Automated  Systems' Agents,"what emerged in the last few years, it is the massive use of information and communication technologies ict in industrial production, in addition the automated systems are integrated in several industries such as automobile, textile and agri-food industry. the objective behind the introduction of automation in these industries was the optimization of the energy, improvement of productivity, and of course the alleviation of the burden of the operator’s work. technological progress is constantly, automated systems are becoming more and more developed which require a skilled and versatile workforce adapted to this technology. itc are more and more used in the moroccan industry, including the use of automated systems in small and medium-sized enterprises smes to improve productivity, competition and ensure the best product’s quality. the agents of these systems have found difficulties with the advent of the technological development of the automation by what the industry of the future requires qualifiers agents, competent or even versatile. the acquisition of new skills, that this either hard or soft, has become a necessity for the users of automated systems in order to keep their jobs within the smes. among the means to help them to acquire the skills is training, several researches related to the training have been established in several areas of activities. yet the industrial sector has not benefited from such research to find out the impact of the training on the employee, the work and the company. in this article we will present the results of our survey in the three industrial sectors dominant in morocco (textile, the agri-food and the automobile) by focusing our study on employees of the automated systems and their relations with the training.","automated systems, training, too","A modest interest of SMEs by continuous training, agents of automated systems do not benefit from training in a fair way (by gender and the Professional grade) compared to their colleagues, which makes their jobs more vulnerable by this that the new technologies require very high skills. With the advent of the industry of the future called Industry 4.0, the machines will be more connected therefore the Human intervention will be at the strict minimum [30], the employees who do not have flexibility and versatility will suffer the consequence of this technological progress, that is to say that these employees will have to acquire new skills to not be lay off. Several researches show that the continuous training of employees has had positive effects in different areas on the three aspects: the personality of the employee, the manner of the work and the company. In addition, a study [31] has demonstrated the advantage of training continues on the health of the trained person, a monetary value is assigned by person and by training, which means that the employee must pay an amount for the improvement of its health through training. The role of agents of automated systems will reside on the analysis of data and the intervention in the appropriate time with more correct decision, therefore the training on similar case will be an asset for these agents. The automation makes the industrial physic tasks of employees very relieve, counterpart it puts their jobs in high risk due to their substitutions by these systems, and in addition it makes the mental and cognitive task more complex [19]. In our study, we found that the continuous training has positive impacts on these three aspects, which coincides with the majority of the research on the training [32], despite the preference of men to women to benefit from the training. In addition, the majority of training is carried out in internal to the company and the themes of training are in relation with the information and the communication technologies. These results present a modest interest by SMEs to the training of their employees, we hope that the employers of these SMEs attach more investment in the training of their employees, by what the positive benefits [33] will be in favour of both: employees and companies.","bakkari mohammed and khatory abdellah laboratory of production engineering, energy & sustainable development (lpesd). faculty of sciences and technolgy of fez, sidi mohamed ben abellah university. fez, morocco mohammed.bakkari@usmba.ac.ma ; abdellah.khatory@usmba.ac.ma",
115,Jigsaw Cooperative Approach In Professional Studies:,"in a very dynamic environment of today’s world, students face many forces destructing them from their studies like trend of internet use, other assignment of curricula, social requirements, fitness issues etc. groups formed in a class also affect their performance. as group of good students will not allow weaker students to enter in their group. it makes the class learning very low and students less responsive/productive in writing their examinations. cooperative approaches are supposed make them more responsive towards their performance by mixing them by breaking their informal structures. it may bring more flexibility in managing their time and effort. one such cooperative method of learning is jigsaw method, a group based learning. this paper presents an effort to implement this method of cooperative learning to management subject taught in a top institute of india. it highlights the feasibility of such approach in the professional studies. a pilot test was conducted for a topic of a subject. evaluation of the groups and the class is done in steps. it is learnt that overall performance of each students has raised and the knowledge of the topic to each one was good. results were exciting. study highlights the pros and cons of this method as applied to a course of a professional program.",,"Result of the study show that the performance of students improved significantly during each step of the study.

Individual expert group performances were increased by 74%, 49%, 37%, 78.8% and 62.8% for Expert Group E1, E2, E3, E4 and E5 respectively. Increase in average performance of students after home group discussion was 24.55%. Individual Home Group performance increment was 22.15%, 22.5%, 27.15%, 31.45% and 18.32% for Home Group H1, H2, H3, H4 and H5 respectively. In conducting this study, few problem were faced. (A) decision of allowing students to discuss their topics at their residence was not correct and led to more time consumption. (B) Absetesm was another problem as students were participating in some cultural function and did not attend the class missing the respective part of the study. Overall increased cumulative time was a great disadvantage. All peers with the instructors believed that this study must be planned well and designed for time. Else, tudents were enthused with this type of approach and performed well, general. This study can be extended to remove the barrier of time and inclusion of complex topics of management.

Using added components such as two cameras, two encoders, one computer, and single microcontroller in each CC, the conventional CC will work automatically controlled from the main office. So then the implementation of autonomous CC will be able to reduce CC operator from 10 operators to 3 operators on each shift. The operator of autonomous CC is also safer than conventional CC since they are working indoor. Undoubtedly, the using of autonomous CC is very effective to cut down the operational cost of a port. Based on the case in Container Terminal of Teluk Lamong the using of autonomous CC will cut down the price to 599,627,310.63 IDR each year, from 859,995,026.40 IDR can be reduce to 260,367,715.77 IDR. The use of autonomous CC will benefit many parties, such as ship owners, port, and shipping company. In the further, Autonomous Container Crane can be developed so it does not require signify modification on the container to make it very flexible if applied in the feeder port that mostly found in eastern Indonesia. Therefore the use of autonomous CC can accelerate the rate of the maritime economy to support Indonesia as world’s maritime axis. CONFLICT OF INTEREST The existence of autonomous CC does not cause any disadvantages to one of the parties. Port, ship owner, and shipping company will be involved in mutually benefit. The addition of the coloured circle at the top of the container can use weather proof sticker material and does not cause any significant changes in the form of the container. The conventional CC operators can be redirected to the other stations such as container handling at the terminal since the number of port capacity is rising.","paris, france, july 26-27, 2018 autonomous container crane to simplify crane operational based on image processing and distance calculation wikandhana rajasa and muhammad habibie naval architecture institut teknologi sepuluh nopember surabaya, east java, indonesia wikandhana.rajasa19@gmail.com, habibie18.hbb@gmail.com septia sari marine transport engineering institut teknologi sepuluh nopember surabaya, east java, indonesia septiaratnasari8@gmail.com rasyid fajar informatics engineering institut teknologi sepuluh nopember surabaya, east java, indonesia rasyidfajar01@gmail.com",
117,A Robust Optimization Approach For Supply  Network Design Under Uncertainties,"in supply chain practices, designing supply network is a strategic decision that affects the survival of an organization. although demand and supply uncertainties are well observed in supply chains, it has not been addressed pro-actively in the design model. vast literatures on network design model had been dealing the problem using either deterministic (using mean value) or stochastic programming. we propose a mathematical model using robust approach where the variability of system performance is taken into account early in the modeling process. using this robust optimization approach, the knowledge of demand and supply distributions is not critical. furthermore, only a small number of scenarios are needed to solve the problem and yet it is able to maintain the adequacy of the model. the result from an illustrative example shows that total costs vary following a normal distribution where its variance depends on the risk parameters.","robust optimization, network design, uncertainties","and further research In this paper, we develop a robust optimization model to network designs taking into account both supply and demand uncertainties. As expected, the resulting solutions are depending on how decision makers view risks and their implications both to costs realization and unmet demands or supplies. The total costs vary following a normal distribution where its variance depends on the risk parameters. Using the same ߣ parameter, the mean cost deviation is larger with larger 𝜔 while the unmet demands and supplies is getting smaller. Conversely, the results also show that when using the same 𝜔, the mean cost deviation is smaller with larger ߣ . The mean unmet demands/suppliers, however, is larger with larger ߣ. In the future, we still have to investigate the model and its solution approach, in particular the effect of discretization of demand and supply distributions. Furthermore, computational complexities of the problems still need to be investigated.

118,Waste Reduction Through Reallocation Of Goods In Food Retail  Companies,"worldwide the issue of food waste is highly relevant and intensely discussed in public media and social networks. the focus is often on grocery retail, not least because it is easily accessible to the public and there is direct contact with the final consumer. the research work presented here establishes a direct link between this issue and the grocery retail and provides a solution for waste reduction in stores of a stationary food retail company. it consists of reducing the average stocks of quickly perishable goods in stores of grocery retailers. we propose a methodical transfer of quickly perishable goods between grocery stores. our solution shows the reduction of inventories without increasing the costs in the grocery stores. the approach is to achieve a daily delivery and an internal transfer of goods between stores. as a result of the decline in average inventories, both waste volumes and total costs are reduced in stores. a realistic simulation study shows that the transfer of goods is a suitable method for the reduction of waste in the considered application area. the developed approach can be implemented in practice without loss of the customer service level.","waste reduction, retail, transfer of goods, perishable goods",,"larissa janssen and alfred wulff department of management, information and technology jade university of applied sciences wilhelmshaven, germany larissa.janssen@jade-hs.de, wulff@jade-hs.de jürgen sauer department of computer science carl von ossietzky university of oldenburg oldenburg, germany sauer@uni-oldenburg.de",

Although many researchers have studied this fact in form of psychological behaviours and behavioural economics, limited research has explored the role of heuristics and biases in the selection and definition of infrastructure projects. Accordingly, this study shows that there is poor awareness about the concept of decision- making heuristics and biases in the context of selection and definition of infrastructure projects. Base on the conducted survey, 88 percent of the participants were not familiar with the concept of decision-making heuristics and biases, and this may result in distorting and perceptions while making a decision. As evident in the survey the poor level of awareness is also true for people who are involved in the decision-making process, where 71% of the participants have been involved in decision-making. The fact is also true for people whom get involved in projects with an average rough order of magnitude proposed cost of 10 million and more. The low level of awareness on decision-making heuristics and biases may discourage the decision-making process. McCray, Purvis and McCray (2002) have stated that through the explicit recognition and purposeful mitigation of unwelcome heuristics and biases the project management process can be enhanced noticeably. This establishes the importance of increasing the awareness of the psychological traps can help to avoid some of the mental pitfalls (Chatzipanos and Giotis, 2014). With the given figures, further research is required to answer the question of how the role of heuristics and biases affects the decision making in infrastructure projects? To what extent does do people fall into do people fall into the decision traps when selecting an infrastructure project? And how the effectiveness of decisions in infrastructure projects can be affected by the presence of heuristics and biases? 6.1 Future work 1) Develop a model and show the potentials of DM-HB: the selection and definition stage of infrastructure projects requires lot of works, data to be analyzed, modelling across individuals and teamwork.

120,A Process Improvement Study In An Emergency Department  Using Lean Methodology,"lean thinking is one of the most modern and well-established methodologies which provide an effective structure to improve the performance of production and service processes including healthcare systems. the objective of this study is to minimize the length of stay (los) of patients at the emergency department (ed) by using the principles of lean production, and thus to increase the satisfaction of patients and medical staff. process improvement methodology and tools were applied in parallel with lean principles to detect the critical quality factors affecting los, and to seek non-value added activities in the emergency service processes. moreover, other tools of lean- kaizen such as fishbone diagram, brainstorming, and vsm are used to analyze the root causes of waste and propose the improvements. appropriate improvements were generated based on lean philosophy coupled with a simulation model.","lean thinking, healthcare, kaizen","The implementation of lean methodology in the healthcare sector is an area which has attracted the interest of practitioners and researchers to improve the performance of medical services. This study was also aimed to improve quality and productivity of healthcare processes through lean production initiatives by focusing on human value rather than products only. One of the challenges in this study is the work in an emergency department which is the most complicated part of the hospital because different patients' requirements depend on each patient's situation so there are different flows with different time cycles and processes. By taking advantage of the product family idea in lean manufacturing which is another contribution to the study; the patients represented as service/products to identify patient families at emergency department based on triage process by using the Emergency Severity Index (ESI). Moreover, from the study it is evident that simulation model is an effective, and methodology will help in gearing up the process by eliminating root causes of the problem, and reducing the length of stay of patients. This will lead to increase the turnaround in the emergency rooms and increase of the satisfaction level of the patients and employees. The effectiveness of the lean projects in health care can be increased by the integration of simulation; many of the risks in the adjustment of an existing system can be avoided, and possible improvements can be observed in a very short time. In this study, the positive results mentioned earlier in the methodology confirmed the decreasing in the length of stay (LOS) of patients and increasing the process cycle efficiency. Hence, this will lead to the increase in the satisfaction level of patients and the medical staff. Therefore, the novelty of our study is applying lean methodology with taking the advantage of product family idea and using simulation model to implement improvements. Clearly from our results, Lean method has emerged as an important methodology in investigating and reducing the wastes in the flow cycle of patients at Emergency Department. As a sequel of the work to gain more customers and keep existing customers, it is important to study costs besides reducing the LOS at the hospital. Moreover, the patient volumes increase during the winter months because certain illnesses are more prevalent, and in particular during the day shift. Since patients will suffer longer delays when the demand is high, a further study to level the workload may be needed. It is important to mention the shortage points in this study, which could be included in a future study, as follows: the limits of time the Level 1 is not considered, and the most repeated flow scenario is taken into consideration for each product family and the other flows were neglected. Furthermore, the simulation model could be used to show further analysis such as the bottlenecks in the system, as well as the utilization percentage of the rooms and medical staff. Finally, the main barriers to implementation of lean methodology at the hospital in this study were: difficulty in obtaining baseline data on process performance; especially there is no record of the time consumed by patients at the hospital and the lack of both information exchange between employees and management, and the improvement culture.","nirouz abeidi department of industrial engineering university of benghazi benghazi, libya e-mail: nayroseb@gmail.com ali turkyilmaz* school of engineering nazarbayev university astana, kazakhstan e-mail: ali.turkyilmaz@nu.edu.kz * corresponding author ozgur uysal department of industrial engineering american university of the middle east dasman, kuwait email: ozgur.uysal@aum.edu.kw",

125,An Intelligent Decision Support System For Smed And Its  Application In Textile Industry,"the new trend is to avoid high-volume batch-and-queue manufacturing to produce small batches with short lead-time due to fluctuation in customer demands. however, producing more products at small batches results in more changeovers. thus, a rapid changeover provides to be able to manufacture small quantities of the large diversity of customer demands. one of the most common method for changeover time reduction is single minute exchange of dies (smed) which is a technique of lean manufacturing. the developed prototype intelligent smed decision support methodology uses the expertise of different experts, professionals and scientific papers. intelligent system approach for smed has two main functions. first one is gathering data that the system asks some questions to the user to obtain the facts of the company and the second one is intelligent recommendations. according to “the facts” and “inference engine”, the system manages the smed application and can give some suggestions. the methodology has forward chaining mechanism and 90 rules. one of the original aspects of the system is starting the methodology with the vision of the firm and strategy. if the strategy is proper for the firm, the system may continue, if not, suggest another strategy such as outsourcing or investment in production technology.",smed,"and Future Research In this study, a prototype intelligent SMED methodology is developed and applied in a textile firm. The SMED methodology is one of the most important techniques in the lean manufacturing implementation. Before applying the SMED, bottleneck machines must be determined in the production line of the company. An injection machine in the line is selected and foot of roller blind, which is one of the products that has high sale volume. 22 observations were made and it is seen that average of the setup time is 51.82 minutes. After applying the SMED, company reduces the setup time approximately 73.1 %, from 52 minutes to 14 minutes. An expert system approach can be used for the application of the SMED as further research. The application can be expanded not only the textile industry but also other manufacturing and service industries. Service industries may include emergency and surgery department of hospitals because time is very important and vital for these departments. An intelligent decision support system software can be developed. Besides, Poka-Yoke (mistake proofing) techniques can be added to the knowledge base of the intelligent system.","onur dogan, ufuk cebeci and m. kursat oksuz department of industrial engineering istanbul technical university macka, 34367, turkey odogan@itu.edu.tr, cebeciu@itu.edu.tr, mkoksuz@itu.edu.tr",
126,Data Perspective Of Lean Six Sigma In Industry 4.0 Era:  A Guide To Improve Quality,"almost all quality improvement methods require data collection and analysis to solve quality problems. the combination of six sigma and lean manufacturing creates lean six sigma methodology that aims to reach six sigma quality levels, less than 3.4 part per million defectives, by reducing variations and wastes within processes. achieving the goal depends on data collection to overcome quality problems. although many traditional data analysis techniques can be used to develop quality of products and processes, massive data sets collected by industry 4.0 technologies should be mined with powerful data analysis methods that produce meaningful results from big data. it is possible to make effective decisions by utilizing these analysis methods in each step of lean six sigma cycles. the use of data analysis methods at every stage, especially in the measure and analyze stages, has critical importance to make powerful decisions. the aim of this study is to provide a guide that allows applying lean six sigma to make faster, more reliable and satisfied decisions with data. it contributes to the manufacturing processes with lean six sigma by reducing the lead- time, producing better quality products; on the other hand, it aids to make effective decisions using different mining techniques.","lean six sigma, industry 4.0, big data, data mining","There are various methods such as inspection, statistical process control, total quality control, zero defects, kaizen and lean six sigma to improve quality. In this study, lean six sigma as a method quality improvement is chosen. It aims to reduce variations and wastes within processes using different techniques. Lean six sigma collects data to achieve its goal. Collected data should be analyzed to make optimum and correct decisions. However, industry 4.0 technologies make possible to collect enormous amount of data. Therefore, traditional data analysis techniques are not sufficient because they require more time and cost. It is possible to benefit from advanced techniques, which are suitable for big data, such as big data analytics and process mining in addition to traditional techniques to make effective decisions for quality problems. Each step of lean six sigma cycles, DMAIC (define-measure-analyze- improve-control) and DMADV (define-measure-analyze-design-verify), contains various techniques. They were shown in Table 2 and flowcharts for each phases are drawn separately. The aim of this study is to provide a guide that makes easier, faster, more reliable and satisfied decisions with data for improving quality in processes. As a further research, the suggested guide will be used in a manufacturing project that intends to solve quality problems using lean six sigma methodology. 951","onur dogan and omer faruk gurcan department of industrial engineering istanbul technical university macka, 34367, turkey odogan@itu.edu.tr, ofgurcan@itu.edu.tr","References

128,Output Level Improvement In Small And Medium-Sized  Manufacturing Enterprises With Regard To Factors,"in today’s competitive business environment, a six sigma quality output from a conversion process of raw materials to products can be obtained not only by focusing on equipment / machines and materials but also on the production-worker who manages the other two elements. since the major asset of most indian manufacturing smes is the production-worker who will have a hands-on role in turning out the desired quality output, a more focus is required on this element. a production-worker at work is affected by a set of factors that needs to be addressed to strengthen the overall effectiveness of the worker for a near six sigma level output. in this paper, an attempt is made to examine the influence of various factors on the production-worker by formulating and testing hypotheses. the data for this analysis were collected from production-workers of small and medium-sized manufacturing enterprises (smmes) in north karnataka through a questionnaire survey. it was found from the study that the output level or ‘overall worker effectiveness (owe)’ of a production-worker is influenced by three main factors, viz. personal, technical, and external or environmental. the results show that personal and technical factors have a significant influence on the overall effectiveness of production-worker and hence on the level of output from him/her.","production-worker, 2008). however","The paper has highlighted that thee production-worker in most manufacturing SMES is one of the causes of rejections since he holds a hands-on role in the conversion process. This is because the components of output level (worker’s effectiveness) – performance, output quality and availability - are influenced by technical, personal and external factors. The factors were identified through literature review and personal interactions with experts from industry and academics. The influence of these factors on the components of output level of workers (overall worker effectiveness) was examined through developing and testing relevant hypotheses. The test of hypotheses through Kruskall-Wallis statistical test revealed that technical factors are perceived to be important by production-workers in influencing their performance and output quality. However, this perceived importance was found to be different among different category workers. Similarly, the test of hypotheses on personal factors to influence performance, output quality, and availability revealed a significant difference in the perceived importance of different category workers. External factors are perceived to be equally important by all category workers. By addressing the barrier effects of a factor pertaining to the components of output level of a worker (overall worker effectiveness) the output level can be enhanced and the production-workers will be capable of turning Six Sigma level output in terms of quantity and quality.","influencing production-workers 1bhimasen soragaon, 2b p mahesh and 3anandkumar r annigeri department of mechanical engineering jss academy of technical education, bangalore - 560060 karnataka, india 1bhimasensoragaon@jssateb.ac.in, bsoragaon@gmail.com, 2bpmahesh@gmail.com, 3a_annigeri@yahoo.com, anandannigeri@gmail.com",
129,Quality Improvement Of Intermediate Shaft Used In Steering  Column Through Tqm: A Case Study,"the aim of this paper is to present a case study on the implementation of a quality circle project under tqm in an auto component manufacturing industry abc ltd. (name changed) situated in gurugram, india to highlight the benefits gained by the company. the tqm implementation at abc ltd. was initiated in 1998 and completely implemented by 2003 in a phased manner. quality circle is not only a problem solving tool, but it may be treated as a communication tool also which helps the organization for continual improvement. the rejection rate of intermediate shafts used in steering column of cars was significantly high and particularly the rejection of nissan intermediate shafts was 68.5% of the total rejections. the company was interested to decrease this high rejection rate using the quality circle approach. after successfully implementing the countermeasures proposed by qc, the rejection rate of nissan intermediate shaft (ims) reduces to zero with in a period of five months.",quality circle,"In order to reduce the rejection rate of Nissan Intermediate shaft of steering column, three main potential causes found by project team responsible for higher rejection rate were to be addressed immediately. The main countermeasures taken were: providing Dowell pins to machine unit, mounting hydraulic pressure gauge in front of the operator of the machine and increase the quantity of grease volume. It was found that due to weak design, the claw position was disturbed during machining of intermediate shaft of steering column. So it was decided to provide the Dowell pins to both side of mounting unit to stop the widening of claw play. To control the tool flow variation hydraulic pressure gauge was provided on both side of the operator and interlinked with machine. To avoid the needle out from bearing case, the quantity of grease was increased from 0.23 gram to 0.35 gram which resulted in less friction between needle bearing and spider. These three corrective actions helped the industry in reducing the rejections of Nissan intermediate shaft of steering column and thus the target of quality improvement by reducing the rejection rate to zero was met successfully.","ankesh mittal sant longowal institute of engineering & technology, sangrur, india ankeshmittal07@gmail.com pardeep gupta sant longowal institute of engineering & technology, sangrur, india pardeepmech@yahoo.co.in",
130,Smart Grid: A Managerial Perspective,"in power grids many issues are involved, namely, storage, generation, quality (fluctuating frequency, fluctuation in power voltage), distribution, power consumption and deciding the rates at which customer needs to be charged. complexity of power grids is very high, namely storage, generation and distribution; and in it role of technocrats is very high. aging assets and lack of resources to repairs and maintenance is a very big issue. in this paper, we focus primarily on revenue management by the use of smart grids, and also suggest a plan for smart grid implementation. we also give few propositions for addressing issues of interoperability and security.",,"It may be noted that current understanding is that the implementation of Smart Meters appears to be economically infeasible, but in the long run when system comes to substantial size, the information made available (that is like knowing the state of heart and pulse of the economy), is useful to policy makers and members of industry (just like credit card information is used by marketers for developing strategy) and it will generate huge revenue. This revenue stream may also be considered while deciding to go for SMART GRIDS; and it may change the balance in favor of SMART GRIDS (from economic perspective). 4.","rrk sharma and kamini singh department of industrial and management engineering iit kanpur, 208016, uttar-pradesh rrks@iitk.ac.in, kamini@iitk.ac.in",

132,Study Of The Impact Of Green Practices On The Performance Of Supply  Chain: Collaborative Approach.,"research in the field of green supply chain management has known a big growth in recent years as the environmental aspect has become a major concern for all internal and external stakeholders of the supply chain. indeed, several researchers have proposed tens of collaborative practices at the green supply chain management level to enable partners to reduce the environmental impact of their activities while ensuring a better level of overall performance of their supply chain. but the implementation of these practices is closely related to other parameters that could have a direct influence on this performance. therefore, the objective of this research work would be to propose a framework that would, on one hand, facilitate the choice and implementation of gscm practices, and on the other hand, study the relationship between gscm and overall performance of the supply chain based on a key parameter which is the capability of collaboration.",,"and perspectives: The originality of this research project lies in its contribution to further reflection on the relationship between GSCM strategies and the measurement of the overall performance of the supply chain. Indeed, several researchers call for a more nuanced analysis of this relationship. In addition, the proposed analysis introduces another moderating element of this relationship, which is the ability of the various supply chain partners to collaborate to see how much influence it has on these two components. Thus the methodological framework that will be developed at the end of this work would have as objective both the production of scientific knowledge and also the proposal of a practical decision panel for the managers of the supply chain based on a methodology research action / intervention known by its cyclical nature as well as a strong implication of the actors of the organization. The architecture of the scientific contribution can be summarized as follows: Scientific contributions:  Analyze the structure, the action plan and the obstacles related to a GSCM strategy.  Identify the different GSCM practices as well as the possible measures for their implementation.  Study the concept of collaboration capability in the context of the supply chain.  Analyze the GSCM strategy relationship and the overall performance of the supply chain by introducing the ability to collaborate as moderator of this relationship.  Study the design of performance measurement systems in relation to GSCM strategies. Managerial contributions:  Propose a clear roadmap for the adoption of a GSCM strategy.  Develop a framework that is both methodological and practical for the implementation of a GSCM strategy.  Design an overall performance measurement system for the proposed framework. 995","abdelwahed echchatbi, abdelkabir charkaoui and mohamed dif el idrissi mechanical, industrial management and innovation laboratory faculty of sciences and technologies of settat, university hassan first fst settat, km 3 casablanca road, morocco. contact_fsts@uhp.ac.ma","References

We have shown the importance of transfer pricing as a decision variable in the capacities delocalization. BEPS project, on its part, has introduced new challenges in terms of transfer pricing. By analyzing results of a case study we measure the impact of using different price methodologies on the overall profit of the company as well as the decision of capacity transfer. Our model can be generalized to make decision for big instance of potential subsidiaries and decide the capacities to be installed in each of these new locations.

137,Quantifying The Life Cycle Cost Of A High Pressure Grinding  Roll In A Mineral Processing Plant,"accelerated advancement of technology and the global economic crisis have prompted the need to improve equipment reliability to reduce unpredicted equipment failures and operating costs. increasingly, attention is focused on the life cycle cost to improve understanding of the equipment’s operational and maintenance costs which are driven by the system maintainability, reliability and required replacement time. this goes hand-in-hand with data availability and quality which play a vital role in the success of life cycle cost implementation. the research provides insight to the field of life cycle cost, as well as to quantify the major cost drivers of the high pressure grinding roll during its operating and maintenance life cycle for a period of four years. from the research findings, it is evident that reliability and maintainability management must be regarded as a vital element corporate strategy. successful implementation of this strategy is reliant on the support of senior management which in turn will ensure that organizational market share is increased and that competitive advantage is maintained.","life cycle cost, reliability, maintenance","The research findings confirm that certain components have a higher influence on the overall LCC. The approach without considering NPV is more applicable where cost information is available and of good quality; whilst the approach considering NPV also provides a better understanding on anticipated future costs which can assist in better planning and decision making on investment. The results indicate that the LCC during the operation and maintenance phase was significantly higher than the acquisition cost. This was possibly due to factors which could not be foreseen during the design and acquisition phase, such as unplanned events and repeated breakdowns and failures. It is evident that much work has been carried out to develop LCC models with an attempt to aid organizations to make informed decisions and manage costs associated with a product or equipment. The following conclusions are drawn from the current research: data availability and quality plays a vital role in the success of LCC analysis; implementation of LCC is reliant on proper record keeping and an efficient enterprise resource planning system; practical implementation of LCC models and analysis within organizations is still noted as a challenge; successful implementation of an LCC analysis should be viewed as a long-term project and can only be implemented if it were supported by top management and relevant personnel in the company. A limitation of the research is that the LCC was modeled on one HPGR where not all the relevant information could be obtained. However, sufficient knowledge has been provided in this research to quantity the life cycle cost of the HGPR and to confirm major cost drivers. Future research may consider the following: reliability of the HPGR in comparison with the calculated life cycle cost; the improvement of reliability on cost control; and how maintenance strategies could be implemented to improve LCC.","njabulo buthelezi, annlizé marnewick and hannelie nel faculty of engineering and built environment university of johannesburg johannesburg, south africa njabulo103@gmail.com, amarnewick@uj.ac.za and hannelien@uj.ac.za",
138,Peformance Analysis Of Dry Steam Geothermal Power Plant  By Modeling And Optimization Of Noncondensable Gas,"geothermal energy was a renewable energy source that uses geothermal fluids to generate electricity. besides, geothermal fluids contain noncondensable gases (ncgs) which can be an negative impact for power plant and environment. ncgs can decrease power output and work in geothermal power plant (gpp). in addition, the higher concentration of ncgs, carbondioxide, contribute to global warming potential in the world. therefore, selection of ncg removal system (grs) becomes a major concen at planning and basic design stage which aims to maximize power output and minimize cost of gpp in a long-term perspective by modeling to simulate dry steam of gpps to examine the thermodynamic and economical performance of grs. this model is validated against actual data in kamojang unit-1 with low disprecancy level (<5% error). to optimize the model, 3 grs configuration was investigated, steam jet ejector with low of motive steam, steam jet ejector with high of motive steam, and compressor system. the allowable condenser and separator pressure was defined to set constraints. under the best configuration (compressor system), the gross power output and overall exergetic efficiency are 53.6 mw and 26%, respectively. furthermore, by 1.5% of interest rate, net present value of the proposed plant was 3,467.","grs, ncgs, modeling, power output",,"removal system fano alfian ardyansyah department of mechanical and industrial engineering universitas gadjah mada yogyakarta, indonesia fano.alfian@gmail.com",
139,A Linear Programming Approach For Land Allocation Of  The Commercial Crops In A Plantation,"india being an agrarian country, more than 60% of population depends on agriculture for their livelihood. commercial crop is a backbone of indian agriculture and currently contributes to around 16% of gdp. but the varying levels in the prices of the commercial crops and the increasing costs for agriculture activities along with the resource constraints has made the farmers think about determining the right crop mix so as to maximize the income. therefore, in order to gain maximum benefits in agricultural activities, a lot of focus is now on the implementation of scientific methods of farming. this research thus focuses on determining the right mix of crops to maximize the income for the four commercial crops, namely arecanut, pepper, coconut and rubber considered in the study. in this research, the lp technique was used in planning the agricultural activities for the two different farms. primarily, a linear programming technique was applied to determine the optimum mix of crops that should have been followed by the farmer so as to fetch the maximum income considering the resource constraints. later, the results obtained using lp technique and traditional methods of farming adopted by the farmer for the allocation of the crops were compared and it was found that the lp technique were superior to traditional methods. since reallocation in the existing farm land is not viable due to the limitation in commercial crops, suitable suggestions were given with respect to the cropping combinations that can be applied practically. a sensitivity analysis was then carried out to determine the optimal capital requirement for the respective farms.",commercial crops,,"raveena s department of humanities and management manipal institute of technology, mahe manipal,576104, karnataka, india raveena.suvarna@gmail.com sunith hebbar department of humanities and management manipal institute of technology, mahe manipal,576104, karnataka, india sunithhebbar@rediffmail.com",
140,Development Of  Variable Toll Pricing Strategy   To Manage Traffic Congestion At Metro Manila Skyway,"the rapid growth of real estate development in the southern luzon (philippines) has fundamentally affected the traffic condition at metro manila skyway. the lack of efficient public transport system from the south has led many residents to acquire their own vehicles to conveniently transport them from home to their respective destinations. this has contributed to the significant increase of both public and private vehicles traveling from south to the metropolis. despite the government efforts to build alternative infrastructures and regulations to minimize the traffic condition, the traffic becomes even worse in recent years. this study has been conducted to develop an alternative solution to alleviate traffic condition at metro manila skyway that connects south luzon to manila. variable pricing strategy has been applied to different industries in the philippines, especially in regulating oil prices but has not been applied to address the worsening traffic condition in the country. this paper aims to simulate variable toll pricing strategies to reduce traffic congestion in metro manila skyway (mms) and determine the optimal revenue generated from the best price strategy. in addition, the study seeks to find out the public acceptability of the best pricing strategy for metro manila skyway. the results of the study have shown that 44% of the respondents chose to use the elevated road during peak hours with heavy traffic despite paying a higher toll rate, while 42% chose to leave earlier or later the peak hours at a lower toll rate. the rest of the respondents chose to use at-grade road during rush hours or elevated road when traffic is moderate with both normal toll rates.",variable pricing,,"queen jean flores, bien carlo realon, lindley bacudio, and giselle joy esmeria* industrial engineering department de la salle university manila, philippines giselle.esmeria@dlsu.edu.ph","References

141,Stakeholder Management: An Analysis Of  The Impact Of Viewing An Organization As A,"corporate project failure in recent times has been associated with poor stakeholder management. these avoidable adverse events are not only prevalent in business corporations; but also in government owned enterprises. project stakeholders have become more influential in the decision-making processes, in project planning and execution. stakeholders cannot be avoided when decisions are made as their exclusions in decision-making may derail organizational objectives. the increased use of consultants in state owned entities has seen some internal stakeholders such as departments and sections within the companies play a less significant role in projects executed by the organizations. the objective of this paper is to explore the implication of ignoring internal units in a large organization in corporate project management. the fundamental flaws identified were associated with stakeholder identification and subsequent inclusion in the planning and execution of the project. the process of identifying the key stakeholders in the bulk flow meter replacement project, the subsequent stakeholder analysis and the emergence of excluded stakeholders are explored; flaws analyzed, and possible solutions given for such future projects. the project revealed the need for project managers to acquaint themselves with the culture, structure of the organization and the interdepartmental and sectional relationships within the organization. the paper exposes why it is unwise and risky for a project manager to view an organization as a single stakeholder. the article concludes with lesson learnt from this project, which are applicable to future projects.",waddock,"Stakeholder analysis plays a vital role in the success or failure of a project as it is central to project planning. This article explored the effect of internal departments, sections and personnel in the projects under organizations which have been viewed as one stakeholder. The article has shown that it is indeed unwise to view any organization, regardless of its size, as a single stakeholder as there may be various stakeholders lurking in its departments and sections. For a comprehensive and inclusive project scope to be developed, a thorough stakeholder identification and engagement process must be conducted to ensure that all necessary input to project scope is extracted from all the relevant stakeholders. Failure to identify and analyse all stakeholders will result in project scope changes, delays and cost escalations, furthermore, it exposes the project to risks of conflict later on during the project lifecycle. The main objective of this study - to explore the implication of ignoring internal units in a large organization in as it pertains to corporate project management was achieved through observation and engagements with key employees. The scope of the study was limited to one case study of a project under the SOC and this limits the generalisation of the findings. The scope can be expanded in future research by exploring more consultant run projects under different SOEs to give a wider view of the influence of consultants in the behavioural pattern of an organization. For further studies, we recommend overall exploration of project management in State Owned Entities especially as it has to do with outsourced projects. This study contributes towards edifying policy makers, politicians, and bureaucrats in their decision making when it comes to allocation and management of projects executed under State Owned Entities. 1054","single stakeholder - a case study of the state water company in south africa eveth nwobodo-anyadiegwu, charles mbohwa department of quality and operations management university of johannesburg, johannesburg, south africa evethn@uj.ac.za shumba lawrence johannesburg water lawrence.shumba@jwater.co.za","References

143,The Impact Of Valuation Heterogeneity On Equilibrium Prices In  Supply Chain Networks,"this paper studies bargaining in two-sided supply chain networks where manufacturers on the demand side purchase an input from suppliers on the supply side. the manufacturers may have heterogeneous valuations on the input sold by the suppliers. in such a supply chain network, a manufacturer and a supplier must have a business relationship or “link"" to bargain and trade with each other. however, a firm on one side of the supply chain network might not have a business relationship with every firm on the other side of the supply chain network. we show that valuation heterogeneity, supply and demand balance, and network structure are the main factors that influence the equilibrium prices, trading pattern and surplus allocation in such a supply chain network. valuation heterogeneity among manufacturers can mitigate unfavorable supply and demand balance to protect some surplus for the manufacturers and leads to higher price dispersion in the supply chain network. we demonstrate that bargaining effectively takes place in smaller subnetworks in a general supply chain network and develop an algorithm to decompose the general network into these smaller subnetworks, which simplifies the analysis of the general supply chain network significantly. we then identify what types of supply chain networks are competitive so that all trades happen at the same competitive price defined solely according to the aggregate supply and demand balance in the supply chain network and/or efficient so that only manufacturers with the highest valuations are able to trade. we also identify what types of links can be added into a supply chain network to improve its competitiveness and/or efficiency.",bargaining,,"alper nakkas university of texas at arlington arlington, tx 76019, usa alper.nakkas@uta.edu yi xu university of maryland college park, md 20742, usa yxu@rhsmith,umd.edu",
144,A Multi-Objective Approach To Sustainable Disaster Waste  Management,"the phenomena of global warming have increased the frequency of natural disasters. these disasters generate thousands of tons of waste and cause loss of human lives, environmental damages, and economic losses every year. increased resilience against future disasters can only be achieved by working on long-term planning and setting goals for ecological, economic and social sustainability in disaster response policies. keeping in view the importance of the considered issue, this study proposed an optimization model for disaster waste processing supply chain network considering economic aspect via total waste processing cost, environmental aspect by greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions from waste processing, and social aspect by job opportunities from waste processing. a possibilistic programming approach is used to cope with the post-disaster uncertain environment and a generic interactive fuzzy solution methodology has been proposed to obtain preferred compromise solutions for proposed model. finally, to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed supply chain network optimization model and solution methodology numerical experiments and sensitivity analysis are performed on a large scale case problem.",,"can be drawn from the results of the sensitivity analysis: 1. If disaster waste managers want to achieve the minimum total debris processing cost while ignoring the rest of the two objectives, the maximum possible amount of disaster debris must be landfilled and the minimum possible amount of debris must be recycled because per ton debris recycling cost is the highest among all three possible debris processing techniques. 2. If disaster waste managers want to achieve a minimum level of total carbon emissions while ignoring the rest of the two objectives (economic and social), then the maximum possible amount of debris must be recycled and incinerated and the minimum possible amount of debris must be landfilled. 3. If disaster waste managers want to achieve the target of a maximum number of job opportunities, then the maximum amount of debris must be recycled and landfilled and the minimum possible amount of waste must be incinerated because incineration process has the lowest job opportunities potential. 4.

An important contribution of this research was the incorporation of all three sustainability dimensions: 
economic, environmental, and social in disaster waste processing supply chain. Furthermore, to minimize 
the capital investment it considered the cement plant kilns as potential locations for disaster waste

145,A Sequential Guillotine Cut Heuristic To   Design Insulating Envelopes,"two-dimensional cutting & packing problems consist in allocating a set of two-dimensional items into a set (possible singleton) of two-dimensional larger objects in such a way that items are completely contained in the objects without overlapping. a particular instance of two-dimensional cutting & packing problem arises in the context of thermal building renovation. this special case deals with the design of insulating envelopes by packing a set of rectangular and parameterizable panels (items) over rectangular facades (objects). taking into account the particularities inherited from the industrial problem and the need of aesthetic results, we propose in this paper a constraint-based heuristic, named casye, based on guillotine cuts technique. first, we introduce the industrial problem and its particularities. then, the constraint-definition of the problem is presented as well as the scheme of the casye solution. at least, the results of the heuristic over realistic facades are shown before the conclusion.","cutting and packing, guillotine cuts","In this paper, we have proposed a sequential heuristic, named CaSyE, which exploits facade geometrical structure and takes inspiration from the human aesthetic concept of symmetry to design buildings insulating envelopes. The motivation behind the cutting approach is the need for designing aesthetics insulating envelopes for facade in an automated fashion. Given that no standard definition of aesthetics exists, we have considered the junctions alignment (symmetry) as a good criterion. The heuristic is based on the well-known technique of guillotines cuts and is able to generate up-to two envelopes. Then, it tries to artificially behave as a human being would behave in the sense that conflicts with frames are avoided while attempting to provide a pleasant appearance. The guillotine cuts technique allows to avoid conflicts of the constraint stated in the model. Also, given that cuts are made from one extreme of the facade to the other, panels junctions are aligned thus given a symmetric appearance. The final position and size of panels are defined according to the non-conflictive areas and panels’ size upper bounds in the aim of minimizing the number of used panels. Finally, it is important to highlight that our solution is built under the semantics of each constraint in the model thus guiding the reasoning of the problem and the application development.","andrés f. barco lidis research group universidad de san buenaventura santiago de cali, colombia, south america anfelbar@usbcali.edu.co michel aldanondo, élise vareilles céntre de génie indutriel université de toulouse, mines albi albi, france michel.aldanondo@mines-albi.fr, elise.vareilles@mines-albi.fr",
146,An Engineering Perspective On The Design Of  Manufacturing Organisations,"despite an extensive body of knowledge about organisational design for manufacturing, the question remains what organisational structures fit best with which competitive priorities and which capabilities of resources, also caused by a lack of comparative studies. four characteristics of organisational design suggest that the structure of manufacturing organisations is a result of inductive and teleological methods, similar to product design and engineering. none of the four traditional approaches embeds principles of the engineering perspective. to demonstrate the suitability of the ‘engineering perspective’, action research at a manufacturer of agricultural equipment has been undertaken. the interplay between the analysis and the organisational redesign yields not only insight about the effectiveness of this fifth approach but also about the limited relevance of the four traditional perspectives. perhaps the design of organisational structures for manufacturing organisations is best served with derivations of the principles and methods of engineering.","decision making, mutations, p. 199)",,"rob dekkers adam smith business school university of glasgow glasgow g12 8qq, scotland rob.dekkers@glasgow.ac.uk",
147,Constructive Matheuristic Algorithms For Solving The  Vehicle Scheduling Problem For Public Transportation,"described here are three hybrid constructive algorithms which combine heuristic and exact methods for solving the scheduling of passenger’s vehicles for public transportation with multiple depots (mdvsp). the first algorithm assigns each one of the scheduled trips to the depots, taking into account the chronological order of the trips and the cost of serving each trip from the depot and then the itineraries are built on a heuristic way (concurrent scheduler). the second method depicts a general attention sequence with all the services. this combines two criteria: chronological order and nearest neighbor for the trips. in order to establish the depot that serve the set of trips, the mathematical model of the generalized assignment problem is used. the third method assimilates graph theory to build itineraries of minimum cost using models of general assignment and minimum flow in a network. in order to validate each one of the algorithms, 90 cases were extracted from the literature, having between 2 and 5 depots, and 100 and 500 trips. the algorithms have response times ranging from 0.015 to 1.7 seconds approximately. the focus of this work is to provide efficient methods in computation times for the real-time reprogramming of vehicle itineraries. primarily to ease the operation when there are contingencies in the mass transit system of the centro occidente de centro metropolitana de colombia amco, whose operation consists of about 5000 trips daily. these algorithms have been applied successfully in our cohort of trips.","heuristic, matheuristic, multi-depot",,"with multiple depots césar augusto marín, luis miguel escobar and rubén bolaños r+d+i integra s.a. pereira, risaralda 660003, colombia cmarin@integra.com.co, lescobar@integra.com.co, rbolanos@integra.com.co john willmer escobar civil and industrial engineering department javeriana university cali, colombia jwescobar@javerianacali.edu.co",
148,An Efficient Algorithm For Work Shift Scheduling In The  Operation Of Massive Transit Systems,"this study is focused in the construction of work shifts for the drivers of the massive transit system in the city of pereira, colombia. starting with the multiple tables of services designed by the public transportation tactical agency (megabús), the problem consists on finding out the minimum and feasible set of work shifts that must be attended by the drivers. arises the need of an adequate division of each one of the time tables, so that each partition meets the constraints of continuous work, and also the maximum work time allowed for a driver in the same day. the methodology consists on a two-phase heuristic algorithm to solve the crew scheduling problem. the algorithm is tested in the massive transit system of the west-center metropolitan area (amco), operated by integra s.a., which attends around 5000 services during weekdays. the proposed methodology reduces the number of work shifts for operating the massive transit system of the amco. the algorithm has a good performance in terms of computing time, it reaches good quality solutions in limited times by the operation, and it is an adequate solution for reprograming the attention of the services during contingencies in the system.","scheduling, heuristics, matheuristics, transportation",,"césar augusto marín, luis miguel escobar and rubén bolaños r+d+i integra s.a. pereira, risaralda 660003, colombia cmarin@integra.com.co, lescobar@integra.com.co, rbolanos@integra.com.co john willmer escobar accounting and finance department university of valle cali, colombia john.wilmer.escobar@correounivalle.edu.co",
149,Critical Success Factors For Erp Implementations : A  Moroccan Case Study,": enterprise resource planning (erp) is an enterprise-wide information system designed to coordinate all the resources, information, and activities, it provides a unified enterprise view of the business for all functions and departments, and also an enterprise database for all business transaction, but despite all the benefits they are also seen as an expensive, profoundly complex, and notoriously difficult to implement because it is different from other it systems. there are as many reasons for successful erp implementations as there are for failed projects.it is really difficult to measure the success of a project of implementation because each organization can look at the success of erp implementation differently. it is important for the organization to have as much information as possible before embarking an erp project, and also respect some critical factor for the success of the project. measuring and knowing the importance of each factor will help an organization to make the right decision, at the right moment. this survey examines and also tries to determine the necessary critical success factors (csfs) in implementing enterprise resource planning (erp) systems and also try to examine the impact of this technology on the performance of the whole organization. we were able to identify six critical success factors by the survey. they are (1) infrastructure, (2) business process management, (3) project management, (4) project team, (5) culture, communication, and change management, and (6) training and education. 1122",,"The objective of this work was to know the perception of Moroccan companies about the CSF considered very important for the implementation of ERP systems, and also to know the impact of ERP implementation on business performance. Initially, we were able to select six CSF and, among these, three were treated in this article through the data received from the questionnaire. To carry out our investigation, we made a questionnaire; it allowed us to collect data from the different participants of different Moroccan companies from different sectors about their perception in terms of importance of these six CSFs .The questionnaire was sent to almost 100 emails, of which 24 were completed. It is important to notify that the respondents belong to the Moroccan companies, and most of them were involved and participated in different phase of the project of ERP implementation. Our survey is distributed in several waves. The first is at the end of 2017 and the additional waves are planned. The survey is also divided into three parts. The first one allows to have the maximum of information on the companies. The second part sought some critical success factors on the ERP implementation. The third part is the part where we try to evaluate the implementation of the ERP by measuring the performance of the company.This paper is a presentation of the data collected through the questionnaire to provides a snapshot. Thus, and after the end of the data collection phase, we will be able to continue our research by analyzing and exploring the data.

151,Keep It Simple – Using The Ishikawa To Identify Key Factors  Leading To Inefficiency And Ineffectiveness Of Employees,"the aim of the study was to identify causes of the inefficiency and ineffectiveness of employees and management at the largest hospital in south africa, to improve the overall service rendered to patients, and to improve the overall operations of that hospital. an observational study approach was followed for the purpose of this study. as part of this approach, observations of particular areas within this hospital were conducted, questionnaires were distributed to a total of 450 participants both patients and hospital employees. with a response rate of 78%, the questionnaire results were able to allow the researchers to develop an ishikawa diagram pointing to the root cause of inefficiency and ineffectiveness of employees and management at the largest hospital in south africa. this paper presents very critical aspects of healthcare services inefficiency as well as ineffectiveness. recommendations made from the findings of this study should allow management improve service delivery at this hospital.","ishikawa diagram, ineffectiveness","The research at this hospital proved that many of the problems experienced by patients were due to the internal problems that the hospital and its management team failed to identify and attend to. The Ishikhawa diagram discovered that the umbrella problems that led to poor service, inefficiency and effectiveness of staff and management were due to the lack of motivation, lack of autonomy, series staff shortage and the lack of knowledge and understanding of the hospital sector. A series of recommendations are given. Should they be implemented and maintained the quality of service and patient satisfaction will greatly improve. 6. Recommendations and the Way Forward From the findings obtained after analyzing the data obtained in this study, the researchers have made the following recommendations: 1) Workshop for employees and management should be organized: The department of public works should organise training workshops for employees and managers in the hospital to ensure that each of them has the adequate knowledge of how to handle patients. These workshops will also educate managers on how to handle and lead staff because it is said that the reflection of staff is through its management, so, if managers are disciplined, handle complaints with absolute courtesy and encourage and motivate employees, the efficiency and effectiveness of staff will be improved overtime (Rust and de Jager, 2010). 2) The chain of command should be reduced: The department of public works should consider reducing the chain of command in order to give managers the autonomy to make decisions that will be faster and beneficial for the hospital and patients. The approach of having to report the breakdown of machines, shortage of beds, shortage of medication etc. can be handled by management to ensure that a much more speedier process takes place instead of wasting time waiting for response from the department of public works which normally responds months after the problem was reported (Rust and de Jager, 2010). To address the issue of trust that exists between the hospitals staff and the department of public works, training and developmental programmes for managers and general employees should be put in place where employees are excessively trained on how to make viable business decisions on behalf of the organisation to help improve service given to patients (Rust and de Jager, 2010). 3) There should a standard appraisal system put in place at the hospital: A performance appraisal system for all staff at the hospital should be derived where an employee seen as the hardest working is given recognition and rewarded with the employee of the month title which may come with a few benefits one that hospital or government can afford. This approach will help motivate and inspire many individuals working in the hospital irrespective of the position they hold. The overall quality of service will be tremendously improved, and many employees will start feeling appreciated and like their service in the hospital is recognised. Appraisals may take place either in groups, departments of individually depending on what management decides upon, however group or departmental appraisals are considered good and fair more especially if a company is implementing the process for the very first time (Rust and de Jager, 2010). 4) Management should urgently consider development programs: To address the issue of the shortage of hospital staff, development programmes can be started for individuals who wish to improve their skills and education in the nursing field. Six-month courses may be offered to employees willing to improve their skills 1157","and management an observational study at the largest public care facility in south africa charles sambil mukwakungu, eveth nkeiruka nwobodo-anyadiegwu, nonzwakazi mntambo department of quality and operations management university of johannesburg johannesburg, south africa sambilm@uj.ac.za, evethn@uj.ac.za","References

154,The Dynamic Simulation Of The Urban Traffic: A Literature  Review,"the establishment and planning of an urban traffic that meets all the requirements of mobility is the basis for achieving of effective economic and social activities within an agglomeration. to do this, several models and software simulations have been developed for very different purposes. the traffic simulation is a tool to study the design and operation of facilities, to estimate the evolution of the traffic conditions on a network and to evaluate their consequences. through this article, we propose an overview of the models and tools for modeling and simulating road traffic. at first, we start, through some definitions, to make an epistemological distinction between the notions of modeling and simulation in the field of traffic. we will then discuss the different modeling approaches used for the road traffic study. subsequently, a classification of dynamic simulation tools and software will be presented.","modelization, dynamic simulation, simulation tools","This work was intended to present the different models, from the literature, that can understand, model and quantify road traffic. As well as the simulation software most commonly used in this field. We have proposed a table of the models treated in the traffic studies, which we have grouped into four classes, namely: displacement demand forecast models, ground occupancy models, flow models traffic and traffic regulation models. These models differ according to the objective envisaged, the planning horizon and the spatio-temporal scale chosen. In a simulation study the quality and quantity of the data is very often the first difficulty that arises to analyze a network. Through this article we proposed the general approach of a study of traffic.","imane moufad laboratory of energy & sustainable development (lpe2d) sidi mohamed ben abdellah university - est, road of imouzzer - bp: 2427 - fez, morocco imane.moufad@gmail.com fouad jawab lpe2d & laboratory of international management decision techniques and logistics sidi mohamed ben abdellah university - est, road of imouzzer - bp: 2427 - fez, morocco jawabf@gmail.com nassima laaraj laboratory of energy & sustainable development (lpe2d) sidi mohamed ben abdellah university - est, road of imouzzer - bp: 2427 - fez, morocco nassima.laaraj1@usmba.ac.ma youness frichi laboratory of energy & sustainable development (lpe2d) sidi mohamed ben abdellah university - est, road of imouzzer - bp: 2427 - fez, morocco youness.frichi@usmba.ac.ma kawtar akoudad laboratory of energy & sustainable development (lpe2d) sidi mohamed ben abdellah university - est, road of imouzzer - bp: 2427 - fez, morocco kawtar.akoudad1988@gmail.com karim ‎zehmed laboratory of energy & sustainable development (lpe2d) sidi mohamed ben abdellah university - est, road of imouzzer - bp: 2427 - fez, morocco zehmed.karim@gmail.com","References

158,"The Impact Of Location Decision On Small, Micro, And  Medium Enterprises’ Performance In Johannesburg","smmes are drivers of economic growth in many economies. in south africa, they play the strategic role of mediating on the triple challenge of poverty, unemployment, and inequality. however, many smmes fail within the first five years because of diverse challenges which they face regularly. location decision is one of the ten critical decisions of operations management. although, numerous smmes owners or managers do not pay attention to the importance of location decisions, yet the location of a business significantly impact on the performance and survival of the business. several factors affect a location decision, which either provide a positive or negative outcome on business performance. the objective of this research is to examine location factors that may affect location decision and how these factors affect the performance of smmes. the results of the study show that positive relationships existed between electricity affordability, customer flows, safe and healthy areas of business environment (independent variables) and business performance (dependent variables). affordability of electricity tariff scored the strongest positive relationship; showing that business owners/managers consider electricity cost as an important factor to observe when searching for suitable business premises. each location choice provides various potentials opportunities and sometimes threats which often emerge as an advantage or an impediment. it is therefore imperative that business owners or managers pay attention and consider seriously, those factors that will determine the quality of their location decisions. this study provides smmes owners or managers with empirical evidence that location factors indeed affect location selection, and hence business performance.","small, location decisions, micro","and recommendations Many start-up mistakes can sometimes be remedied, but a poor location decision is difficult, and sometimes impossible to change (The staff of entrepreneur media, 2015). The location of a business significantly impacts on the business’s survival. Each location choice provides various potentials, opportunities and sometimes threats which often emerge as an advantage or an impediment. It is therefore imperative that business owner and managers pay attention and consider seriously, those factors that will determine the quality of their location decisions. Given the high level of business failure among SMMEs all over the world and South Africa in particular; the study is a contribution to the illumination of the understanding of new ventures in the area of location decisions; so that they are able to make informed decisions which may improve the chances of survival of their businesses. This research has presented the perception of location decision of SMMEs in the city of Johannesburg. Particularly, the research investigated the degree to which the predetermined variables (labour, electricity factors, proximity to customers, proximity to suppliers, proximity to competitors, and safe and healthy location) affect the dependent variable which is business performance. The research established that among all the variables, affordable electricity tariffs has the strongest and positive relationship with business performance. It was also discovered that safety and health and high customer flow have a relationship with business performance. Nevertheless, the theoretical results show that all six independent variables influence location decisions and therefore business performance. Furthermore, more companies as part of their contribution to the growth and development of SMMEs, should sponsor programs and conferences to share ideas and experiences on the import of location decision and what criteria can be used for location analysis to enable SMMEs make informed location selection decision for their business.

To this end, Data Envelopment Analysis method was used to evaluate and compare performance along three dimensions, namely production efficiency, operational effectiveness and overall performance. The D.E.A results revealed that company operating in Casablanca city was the most efficient in the sample. As for the operational effectiveness, the companies of Casablanca and Marrakech cities are the most effective of the sample. Finally, these two operators are ranked first, in the sample, in terms of overall performance. Based on the overall performance measure, the search results also identify potential performance improvements for each underperforming operator. This result provides practical information to operators or delegating authorities on the percentage that an operator needs to increase its outputs or reduce its inputs in order to achieve 100% performance (or to achieve an overall performance score equal to 1). 1246","zehmed karim high school of technology (hst) sidi mohamed ben abdellah university (smbau) pb 2427 imouzzer road 30000 , fez, morocco karim.zehmed@usmba.ac.ma; zehmed.karim@gmail.com jawab fouad high school of technology (hst) sidi mohamed ben abdellah university (smbau) pb 2427 imouzzer road 30000 , fez, morocco fouad.jawab@usmba.ac.ma; jawabf@gmail.com","References

176,The Masking Effect Due To Industrial Noise And Applying  The Method Of The Level Of Interference With Speech,"the masking effect due to noise manifests itself not only on auditory warning signals, but also verbal communication. communication in noise increases both the workload of the person who sends and the one that receives; indeed, the first must raise their voices, the second attention makes an effort to understand the message. this difficulty understanding increases when the operator must pay attention simultaneously to the verbal message and signals from other sources. in this case, the focus of attention on the verbal message reduces the attention span and therefore the operator's ability to meet competing demands.","sound field, sound power, noise",,"dr. abderrezak hocine1 abderhocine@gmail.com electromechanical engineering research laboratory badji mokhtar annaba university, algeria. dr. dalia abdallah2 baladalia@gmail.com electromechanical engineering research laboratory badji mokhtar annaba university, algeria.",
177,Towards Sustainable Society: Design Of Food Waste  Recycling Machine,"qatar is one of the top 10 countries in the world in terms of per capita food waste; which ranges from 584 to 657 kilograms per year. the combination of high food consumption rate and very low food waste recycle rate, results in mountains of food dumped into landfills where they get burned and produce harmful gases. in this paper, we are introducing a practical solution to recycle food wastage at home. the solution is to design an eco-friendly machine that converts food waste to fertilizer. the use of recycled food waste as compost improves the soil health and structure, increases drought resistance and reduces the need for supplemental water, fertilizers and pesticides. the composting process is fully automated, it consists of several steps under controlled environmental conditions to fasten the process. a mechanism is designed to reduce food waste volume and experiments were conducted to figure out the best conditions of temperature, moisture content and the bulking agent that would result in a high-quality homemade fertilizer within hours. we constructed a prototype of the machine where we focused on the aesthetics aspect by designing an elegant machine with a suitable size to be placed in any kitchen.","recycle, composting, food waste, design","All in all, this paper aim is to show the importance of recycling food waste and helping the environment by building a machine that converts food waste into compost. The machine is completely manufactured in Qatar. This food waste recycler machine is to be built and used at home safely. The design methodology and the engineering solutions that will be used in this project were explained in the engineering design process. Followed by the identifying the customers, knowing their needs and taking their feedbacks, which are considered important since our purpose is to satisfy the customer’s needs. Furthermore, a quality function deployment was used to translate customer needs into design specifications. In addition, the external and internal constraints and the design standards were identified. Moreover, the conceptual design for the machine, the design alternatives, alternatives evaluation, and the machine’s final design all were discussed briefly and shown in detail in this paper. Since the world is seeking sustainability, our machine aims to lessen the food waste that is thrown into the landfills, which pollute the environment by recycling the food waste and turning it, in less than 24 hours, to compost that can be used in fertilizing the soil to plant healthy and organic food, and contributing in creating a safe and sustainable world.

181,Predictive Model On The Severity Of Musculoskeletal  Disorder And Accidents Of Truck Drivers In The Philippines,"truck driving is known as one of the occupations with the highest accident rate. truck drivers have also shown to increase risk for developing musculoskeletal disorders. the risk for accident and musculoskeletal disorder were mostly attributed to factors such as human, vehicle, work conditions and other variables. because of this, truck drivers face a variety of occupational risk. this paper aims to develop a predictive model on the severity of musculoskeletal disorders and severity of accidents encountered by truck drivers in the philippines. to analyze this problem, literature review, survey, ergonomic evaluation and statistical analyses were used to verify significance of each factors in the occupational risk of truck drivers. this paper had found that significant factors that affect the musculoskeletal disorder of truck drivers are age, bmi, blood pressure, travel duration, frequency of deployment and truck ban. on the other hand, significant factors that affect the severity of accident are work shift, type of truck driven, driver mood, type of roadway, road character and traffic condition. to further address the problem, health guidelines, traffic regulations and safety precautions were developed by the researchers in order to minimize the risk of musculoskeletal disorder and accidents of truck drivers in the philippines.","occupational risk, truck accidents","The objectives of the study were all met with the use of tools and techniques relative to data gathering, analysis, and proposition of feasible solutions. Using a survey questionnaire, the researcher was able to gather information on the drivers’ personal profile, working condition, and details on accident involvement. With this, it helped the proponent to identify the risk factors present in logistics operations. With the use of Cornell Musculoskeletal Discomfort Questionnaire, it was found that upper back (21.55%), followed by right shoulder (14.37%), lower back (12.52%), and right upper arm (10.20%) are the body parts of the drivers that are most exposed to musculoskeletal disorders. It was also found that 79% of the respondents did not have any proper training since they have engaged in driving profession. Hence, many were not practicing proper seating adjustment that may lead to discomfort and potential accidents. Furthermore, there were two (2) types of trucks used in logistics operations: straight truck and trailer truck, although may have same design of the cockpit but have different sizes and load capacities. Also, most of the trucks used in logistics operations were acquired from auction dealers or private owners hence, the trucks are old and 75% are 15 years and above. Moreover, the number of drivers among the respondents who were involved in accident was also collected wherein 49% were involved, in which 4% of the severity were fatal, and that 67% were due to human factors. Accident sub factors were also collected in order to determine the significant predictors of the accidents. With the use of ergonomic tools and techniques the researchers were able to determine the significant factors affecting the severity of musculoskeletal disorders and the severity of accidents. The final RULA score for the driving posture of the respondents pose medium risk to MSD that led the researchers to recommend an ergonomic truck seat based on the technical and customer requirements and anthropometric measurements of truck drivers. Additionally, it was identified that personal factors, physical working condition factors, and vehicle factors appear to be good predictors to the severity of musculoskeletal disorders while vehicle factors and accident sub factors are significant to the severity of accidents. With the help of the Minitab software, it was determined that age, BMI (obesity), blood pressure, most frequent continuous travel, average frequency of deployment, and truck ban are significant factors affecting the severity of musculoskeletal disorders. Meanwhile, the work shift, type of truck, driver mood, type of roadway, road character, and traffic condition were found to be significant factors to the severity of accident. Since most of the drivers did not undergo proper training in driving profession, the researchers recommended that trucking companies must require their existing drivers and potential applicants to take the Driving (Articulated Vehicle) NC III offered by the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA). With this, the drivers will be educated on restrictions codes, minor repairs on the assigned vehicle, and compliance with traffic rules/regulations and ordinances. Relative to the training and development of the drivers, this study also provides guidelines on traffic regulations and safety precautions to minimize the risk of getting involved in accidents. As per the predictive model, the identified significant factors to the severity of accidents are the type of roadway and road character. From this, the researchers collected information in order to serve as guide for the drivers. This include the maximum allowable speed limit depending on the type of roadway, proper overtaking and passing, right of way and signals, proper turning at intersections, and being aware of blind spot. By following these recommendations and guidelines, it is expected that the severity of musculoskeletal disorders as well as the severity of accidents will at least be minimized if not eliminated. From the computation of the sample values from the actual data and comparing the results to the recommended target results, the researchers were able to show that the severity of accident show that the fatality from 2.86 (Fatal) was reduced to 1.09 (Non-fatal) under the circumstances that the drivers travel at night, using a straight truck, with a relaxed mood, on a two-way lane and straight road, and when on a standstill or unmoving position. 1388","ma. janice j. gumasing department of industrial engineering and engineering management mapua university 658 muralla st., intramuros, manila, philippines mjjgumasing@mapua.edu.ph marcelli elaine g. pacheco department of industrial engineering and engineering management mapua university 658 muralla st., intramuros, manila, philippines marcellielainepacheco@gmail.com","References

185,New Product Quality And Timing Under Competition  Professor Sudhakar D. Deshmukh,"better quality products capture larger market shares and yield higher profits. however, improving product quality takes time, during which a competitor may develop and introduce a product to usurp a market share, leaving a smaller market for the laggard firm. competing firms must balance these two effects in determining their strategies of new product development of quality and timing of its introduction. we model this innovation competition as a stochastic game between two firms and characterize their equilibrium strategies. we show that in equilibrium, each firm will set a target quality that it aims to develop before introducing the product into the market. the technologically stronger firm is shown to set a higher target quality and capture a larger market share than the weaker firm. competition to be the first is shown to induce both firms to set lower targets and introduce inferior products sooner than they would without competition. however, the consumers are shown to be better off with competition than with a weak monopolist. a strong monopolist is shown to yield an even better outcome for the consumers, which is in fact shown to be socially optimal. finally, this socially optimal outcome is also attainable with competition among equally strong firms, and is in fact attained at a pace faster than that with a monopolist. thus, competitive innovation among competitors of equal strengths is shown to be the best industrial structure for the society. 1418 proceedings of the 2nd european conference on industrial engineering and operations management (ieom) paris, france, july 26-27, 2018 © ieom society international",,,"kellogg school of management northwestern university evanston, il 60208 u. s. a.",

191,Performance Of Phase Ii Approaches For Monitoring  Multivariate Multiple Linear Profiles Based On Estimated,"profile monitoring is usually performed by establishing control charts. in most of the cases, the in-control values of the profile parameters are assumed to be known in phase ii, whereas it is not valid in many practical situations. in this article, we investigate the effect of parameters estimation from in-control phase i samples on the in-control and out-of-control performance of two phase ii control charts for monitoring multivariate multiple linear profiles designated as and . the out-of- control performance of the methods is evaluated by using corrected limits to consider the variability due to parameters estimation. the performance of the monitoring approaches is compared in terms of statistical properties of arl distribution including aarl, sdarl and cvarl in order to consider practitioner-to-practitioner variability trough a monte carlo simulation algorithm named as arls. the results showed that parameters estimation severely effects on the performance of the monitoring schemes.","estimation effect, phase ii, profile monitoring","remarks and future study suggestions In this study, we evaluated the performance of two Phase II control charts for monitoring multivariate multiple linear profiles: and control charts proposed by Eyvazian et al. (2011) when parameters are estimated. Three different criteria: AARL, SDARL and CVARL are applied to compare the in-control and out-of- control performance of monitoring approaches by a new Monte Carlo simulation algorithm named as ARLS. The results showed the significant impact of parameters estimation on the both in-control and out-of-control performance of the monitoring approaches. The simulation study illustrated that the number of Phase I samples should be as large as possible in order to achieve an accurate estimation. According to the results, method performs better than other MEWMA method in terms of in-control AARL and CVARL. This method also performs better than MEWMA method in terms of SDARL metric except in small shifts. The out-of-control performance of each method was evaluated using ARLS algorithm in terms of all three metrics. The results showed that method is the best method in detecting shifts in regression coefficients in terms of out-of-control AARL, SDARL and also CVARL metric. It can be concluded that the method that is the extension of MEWMA method is better than its classical version in about all the cases based on estimated parameters As future researches, we recommend evaluating the effect of parameters estimation on the performance of the control charts for monitoring other types of profile such as: polynomial and nonlinear profile. Furthermore, proposing new metric for measuring estimation effect can be remarkable.","parameters ahmad ahmadi yazdi department of industrial and systems engineering isfahan university of technology isfahan, iran ahmad.ahmadi@in.iut.ac.ir ali zeinal hamadani department of industrial and systems engineering isfahan university of technology isfahan, iran hamadani@cc.iut.ac.ir amirhossein amiri department of industrial engineering shahed university tehran, iran amirhossein.amiri@gmail.com",
192,An Investigation Into The Causes Of Continuous Resistance To  The Implementation Of A Centralised Hr Support Services,"this paper explores the dynamic process of change and change management. while change is about moving to a future state, change management is the process of supporting individual employees impacted by the change through their own transitions. the study aimed to investigate the causes of continuous resistance to change towards the implementation of a centralized hr support services from business units of a multinational mining house, company x (pseudonym) with operations in southern africa. the study used both quantitative and qualitative research methods using survey questionnaires and semi structured interviews for data collection to explore different experiences of key employees and management of the mining company and industry as a whole. this study found that poor communication, poor leadership, and poor change management result in resistance to change. some key recommendations put forward for company x leadership are to produce a change management framework specific for each business unit concerned, including feedback sessions, and the need to have a communication plan about the need for change and its benefits to be used to persuade employees to accept the change programme. this research contributes significantly to thought leadership on the issues of change and change management in the south african mining industry.","change, business units, change management","This research has provided valuable insight on the importance of organisations being ready for change in order to implement change successfully. The findings suggest that change planning processes and systems were not adequately in place or implemented which led to discontent amongst employees at company X. Popular theory states that employees as well as the structure of the organisation must be ready for change. Majority of the respondents felt that more rigorous change planning and deeper stakeholder engagement could have prevented some of the challenges experienced at Company X. The current socio economic climate is increasingly unstable for company X. From reform in the global mining sector to issues of social risk in the South African labour market, the company should take this opportunity to learn, reflect and improve ways of working through localised solutions and meaningful engagement with staff teams. The conclusions to this research have been summarised around the research questions of the study which are directly aligned to the objectives. 5.1 What are the perceptions of employees towards effective change management at Company X? There was disengagement in perception and misunderstanding of the change that was identified as being prevalent at both BUs. The difference in perception of top management and employees towards effective change brought about lack of alignment, wrong perception of the change to be implemented, resulting in a low sense of urgency for employees at Company X. A disconnection between top management and employees’ perception is present in that management is of the view that the change was warranted based on thorough analysis of their BUs in SA. Management stance was that blue chip companies had to follow predominant industry practices that have success records once implemented. Management is able to see the positive changes that the new HR model brings, such as better policies, better control systems; better employee engagement, and cost reductions. However, although workers attest to the HR model being efficient, they have negative perceptions on its implementation process. 5.2 What are the root causes of the continuous resistance to the implementation of a centralized HR Support Service at Company X BUs? Parochial self-interest, possibility of jobs becoming obsolete, fear of job losses, and a preference to continue with previous ways of working so as not to lose control were identified as some causes and barriers to change within the BUs. Lack of effective leadership in change management was instrumental in the resistance to change; there was disengagement in the views of top management and those of the managers and employees at the operational level that have to work with the new HR model. The lack of efficient change agent was also identified as a possible cause to the continuous resistance to change as there was not sufficient interaction and engagement with the affected employees. Critical decisions about change were made without their input nor consultation. Employees at Company X shared the desire to have experienced a more personal and transparent leadership style. Lack of employee involvement in the decision making processes can lead to employees not assuming ownership, lack of commitment, manifesting in work stoppage, high turnover, or absenteeism. The findings show a lack of trust amongst employees and top management and this hampered relationship building during the change implementation process. 1480","within a global mining house stella zoë mulombe regenesys business school johannesburg, rsa stellazoet@yahoo.com chipo mugova mancosa graduate school of business 16 samora machel st durban central, 4001 durban, rsa mugovac@gmail.com","References

194,Open Innovation Stages In The Service Sector,"open innovation is a paradigm proposing that companies can benefit from using external pathways and knowledge and that firms should cross their boundaries in the product development and innovation management. since several firms have gained success from practicing open innovation, the paradigm has received high attention from the academia and businesses. however, in spite of the service sector’s high economic contributions, open innovation in the sector is still under-researched. this study focuses on open innovation stages in the service sector and identifies the important processes and barriers in each stage. the results include four stages of open innovation implementation and insights on processes including process selection, partner selection, goal setting and influential factor control. the information used in this study came from the interviews with service companies in thailand from three industries, which include financial intermediation, telecommunications and knowledge-intensive industries. the study closes the gap in the academic area as well as provides managerial insights and guidelines for service companies to adopt open innovation more effectively. keyword innovation, open, service, knowledge 1. introduction open innovation refers to a paradigm proposing that firms should go beyond their boundaries in product development. ideas do not always have to be initiated or developed within the companies. in other words, companies should combine external knowledge with the internal knowledge pool or take the internal ideas to develop outside in their innovation management. to practice open innovation, firms need to have a business model that integrates the external and internal knowledge to create value and to capture that value. (h. w. chesbrough, 2003) studies on open innovation were commonly focused only on the manufacturing sector. however, no study particularly emphasizes on how service companies implement open innovation although the service sector generate the highest contribution towards the economy in today’s industrialized world. even though there is evidence that service companies have adopted open innovation, the insights on the implementation process has not been sufficiently known and documented.(mention, 2011; mention & asikainen, 2012; patrick schueffel1, 2015) therefore, because of the rising importance of the service sector, it is worthwhile to explore the stages in open innovation implementation in service firms. this study aims to answer the questions: what are the stages in open innovation implementation in the service sector and what are the important processes and barriers in each stage? the stages were determined to understand the steps firms have to go through in the open innovation implementation. identifying the important processes provides the firms with the guidelines on how to implement open innovation effectively. furthermore, by knowing the barriers, firms could be aware of the challenges they might face and prepare some mitigation 1487",,,"pimprabha sirito school of mechanical and manufacturing engineering the university of new south wales (unsw) sydney 2052, australia pim_sirito@hotmail.com maruf hasan school of mechanical and manufacturing engineering the university of new south wales (unsw) sydney 2052, australia m.hasan@unsw.edu.au","References

195,Discharge Times Of Ultrafine And Superfine Powders In A  Short Riser Circulating Fluidized Bed At Different,"discharge times, td, of sub-micron ultrafine and micron-size superfine powders from a circulating fluidized bed (cfb) with the cyclone upside stream were investigated using a geldart a-c mixture of ultrafine and superfine al(oh)3 powders and coarse fcc particles. td which refers to the time needed for complete depletion of the fine powders contents from the fluidizing system. variation of discharge times of ultrafines and superfines with the equilibrium water content of fcc particles was investigated at a 5 wt% maximum loading of ultrafines and superfines. the superfines discharge times decreased noticeably using bed particles humidified with gas of higher (larger than 50%) relative humidity. bed particles humidified using lower (35%) relative humidity showed very high discharge times at higher contents of fines. relatively larger discharge times of the cohesive ultrafines were measured compared with those of the less cohesive superfines. key words: circulating fluidized bed; discharge times; equilibrium water content; ultrafine powders, superfine powders 1. introduction practical applications of geldart-c powders (geldart, 1973) are increasing widely due to their extreme specific surface area per unit volume. it is concluded that fine powders, <10µm, have strong adhesion and cohesion characteristics (jacques, 2002). motion of superfine powders of few microns and sub-micron ultrafine powders in fluids is rather difficult due to poor aeration (bruni et al., 2007). they tend to form bridges, adhere to surfaces, form agglomerate, clumps and solid aggregates when flowing (wang & kwauk, 1998). however, cohesive fine powders still exist in fluidized beds as individually dispersed particles. extensive studies have been made on the cohesive forces and other various forces affecting fluidizing systems in presence of fine powders. factors affecting formation of agglomerates, clumps and solid aggregates, such as the particles density, superficial gas velocity, etc. were presented by chaouki et al. (1985). interparticle adhesion forces were found to reduce the entrainment rate during fluidization of fine particles (santana et al., 1999). experiments studying effects of liquid bridge forces (mc laughlin & rhodes, 2001) and magnetic forces (rhodes et al., 1498 proceedings of the 2nd european conference on industrial engineering and operations management (ieom) paris, france, july 26-27, 2018 © ieom society international",,,"humidification conditions emad a. m. abdelghani minia university, faculty of engineering, chemical eng. dept., minia, p.o. box 61519, egypt yanbu industrial college, colleges & institute sector, royal commission yanbu, p.o. box 30346, yanbu industrial city 41912, kingdom of saudi arabia (current) mahmoude@rcyci.edu.sa, omaremad@yahoo.com mohammad w. hakami yanbu industrial college, colleges & institute sector, royal commission yanbu, p.o. box 30346, yanbu industrial city 41912, kingdom of saudi arabia. hakamim@rcyci.edu.sa, mohhakus97@gmail.com","References

199,Applying Demand Aggregation To Improve Forecasting  Accuracy,"forecasting accuracy is an important issue for effective decision making in the areas of strategic planning, production planning, inventory management and other areas. in particular, this aspect is most relevant for items that have demand patterns with important levels of intermittency and lumpiness. this work describes the efforts of a mexican company to look for opportunities to improve the level of forecasting accuracy through the application of demand aggregation to all the items of the company´s catalogue. the level of demand aggregation considered is a period equivalent to the review plus de response time periods of the periodic review management system used by the firm. initial results are obtained from a pilot study carried out in all the stores of the tijuana plaza of the company. the resulting forecasting mean squared error (mse) was decreased significantly in the range of 32 to 56%. the firm estimates a reduction in the order of 17.7 to 33.9% in safety stock requirements will be possible due to the improvement in forecasting accuracy.","display inventory, retail echelon","and recommendations The level of competitiveness of the retailing sector is dependent on the level of product availability at the store. Under these circumstances, the effectiveness with which inventory management is performed becomes very important. Too much is expensive, and too little implies the appearance of more frequent stockouts. An important factor that impacts significantly inventory management is forecasting accuracy. The case of study treated in this paper deals with the improvement of the level of precision of demand forecasting at the store level. The company was dealing with the problem of having excessive level of inventories in its stores in terms of days of inventory. An exhaustive analysis of the contribution to this excess was developed and found that forecasting performance for inventory management purposes could be improved. Thus, an initiative based on the application of the ADIDA (Nikolopoulos et al., 2011) methodology could be implemented for these purposes. The impact expected with the full implementation of the previous initiative is a safety stock reduction in the order of 17.7 – 33.9%. Given these expected results, “The One” management decided to pursue full implementation during year 2018.","estefanía quintanilla, mariana herrera, delia villarreal & bernardo villarreal universidad de monterrey san pedro garza garcía, n.l., méxico 66238 estefanía.quintanilla@udem.edu mariana.herrera@udem.edu delia.villarreal@udem.edu bernardo.villarreal@udem.edu",

207,A Data-Driven Systematic Approach To Characterize Job  Complexity And Predict The Optimal Resource Requirement,"in the dynamically changing manufacturing environment, human resource management has always been a complex process as it is challenging to quantify and relate the job complexity to the required work effort. this is mainly because indirect labor deals with technical project oriented tasks and the driving force behind its requirement is not directly related to unit output. in this study, a data-driven systematic approach is developed to characterize the job complexity of indirect workforce and predict the optimal workforce requirement and performance targets via data envelopment analysis (dea). firstly, the job complexity is defined by its attributes and quantifying them in the form of an index. subsequently, together with other key performance measurable, they serve as the outputs and number of engineers as the input for the non-parametric frontier modelling. the model is validated by evaluating the past relative efficiency performance of the different teams which will then be used as benchmark for the study. the effects of varying the output measurable on the optimal workforce requirement are illustrated via three real case scenarios. the approach provides a clear understanding of the team performance based on different performance measurable, and also serves as a decision-making tool for the managers to allocate their workforce in the light of changing manufacturing environment so that their shortages and excesses can be addressed more efficiently and effectively, thereby boosting productivity.","job complexity, yield management",,"and performance targets via data envelopment analysis pamela lin, nicolas delagneau and john kuan infineon technologies asia pacific pte ltd 8 kallang sector, singapore 349282, singapore yanlingpamela.lin@infineon.com, nicolas.delagneau@infineon.com, kuan.john@infineon.com",
208,Internet Of Things For Different Types Of Retail Formats,"technology centered businesses are highly motivated and accepted in the present information age. more and more organizations are trying to introduce ict in their daily operations and making their business leaner and flexible. brick and click retail formats like hypermarkets, specialty stores and convenience stores are using technological platform, like internet of things (iot) for widening their reach to the customer. this piece of research tries to show the relationship between the cost and the strategy of a retail format with the adaptation of iot in their operations.","iot, retail formats, ict","Technology adaptation and openness to technology are two different aspects and organizations need to analyse it with their s-curve (technology adoption curve). Big organizations mostly do mistakes in earlier adaptation of technology because of peer pressure in the market, but not able to leverage the maximum outcome of the particular technology. In case of large scale e-retailers (hypermarkets), they are encouraged to adopt and upgrade the new IoT technologies but keeping in mind of the long term strategies. Spending high budget in technology does not ensure the competitive edge. Sometimes, lower level of technology at right time of the market drivers will produce great results. In this research, we have seen like hypermarkets (big-budget stores) are spending high amount on technology adoption but they need to critically analyse and synchronise the technology with their organizational structure and strategy. Retailers need to classify their needs of IoT and small retailers need to pool themselves for technology adoption to reduce the overall cost and leverage the maximum potential of the particular IoT.","vinayak a. drave department of industrial engineering iit kanpur, 208016, india vinayak@iitk.ac.in prof. rrk sharma department of industrial engineering iit kanpur, 208016, india rrks@iitk.ac.in",

211,A Study On The Effects Of The Future Value Of Fares For  Airline Revenue Management,"a novel emsr (expected marginal seat revenue) concept is proposed by considering the future value of airfares and seat inventory allocation. the seat allocation resulting from the extensions of emsra & emsrb will be examined in terms of the protection limit, booking limit, and the possible maximum revenues. in our findings, we suggest that the decision makers should recognize the actual value of the revenues from the lower fare classes in the early stage of a flight booking period and adjust the seat inventory allocation in real practice.","emsra, emsrb, future value","We have examined the results of protection limits, booking limits and the possible maximum revenues from different EMSR models, especially the extensions of EMSRa & EMSRb. We found that, if we consider the future value of fares, as the return rate on investment or inflation rate rises, the protection levels for the higher fare classes will be decreased and the booking limits for lower fare classes will be increased and the possible maximum revenues will increase. The results reflect that the managers of seat inventory control need to recognize the actual value of the revenues from lower fare classes and should apply the concept to their seat inventory allocation practices. If the return rate of revenues from the early stage of booking period is high enough, it is more appropriate to allow more bookings in the lower fare classes in terms of maximizing the revenues.

A nested design and a crossed design were used for experiments in order to isolate and estimate the components of variability in the measurement system. The experimental data were analyzed by Analysis of Variance and gauge capability was evaluated by precision-to-tolerance ratio and percent contribution of variance components to the total variability. The GR&R study provided guidelines for improving performance of the measurement system. The variability due to the operators (reproducibility) was eliminated through a new measurement procedure and operator training program. Calibration, proper use and maintenance of the instrument or replacement were suggested in order to reduce the variability due to the gauge itself (repeatability).

214,"© Her Majesty The Queen In Right Of Canada, As Represented By The Minister Of National Defence, 2018  A Methodology For Relative Performance Comparison Of","an underwater acoustic sensor network (uasn) is compared with the use of legacy expendable sonar sensors. a simple means is derived to compare these two types of systems, namely the uasn and expendable sonobuoy sensors, to determine the relative comparative use of the uasn as opposed to the legacy sensors. the comparison is utilized to demonstrate the potential advantages of using such a system over conventional sensors if the system exceeds the operational efficiency of legacy underwater expendable sonar systems by a given factor. the methodology uses a simulation of a distribution of sensors which have a performance in terms of target detection based on a median detection range (mdr) and the use of a ‘cookie-cutter’ approach. the comparison between the dissimilar sensors is accounted for by a relative sensor performance factor (rspf) of acoustic performance which although is based on range should also account for the sensor system performance under the same acoustic environmental conditions. only passive acoustic underwater sensors are considered. an example deployment is used in a choke-point scenario, for the straits of gibraltar. given even a nominally small rspf between the sensors, the uasn could provide a higher operational advantage over legacy sensors.","sonar, modelling","A methodology for comparing an Underwater Acoustic Sensor Network (UASN) to legacy sensors is used to differentiate the UASN from the use of legacy expendable sonobuoys. The methodology uses a simulation of a distribution of sensors which have a performance in terms of Probability of Detection (PD) of the target based on a Median Detection Range (MDR) for the sensor and the use of a ‘cookie-cutter’ approach. The scenario chosen for the example was the Straits of Gibraltar in which a straight line of equidistant sensors are placed across the Strait. The number of sensors required to achieve a PD up to a maximum 100 percent is used to give a relative performance between the systems. The difference between the systems is accounted by a straight forward difference in decibels converted to range as a Relative Sensor Performance Factor (RSPF). The number of sensors and the resulting PD can then be determined for each system, when the system parameters are known. The system parameters for the UASN should then be determined from Operational Trials and Analysis (OT&E). Future enhancements to the methodology could examine the temporal nature of the problem, since the endurance of each sensor is also a factor in their employment. In addition, active sensors are also a possible UASN development, 1623","underwater acoustic sensor networks and legacy expendable sonar sensors mark a. gammon and stephane blouin defence r&d canada - atlantic research centre dartmouth, ns, canada, b2y 3z7 mark.gammon@drdc-rddc.gc.ca stephane.blouin@drdc-rddc.gc.ca","References

215,Investigation Of Poor Service Delivery Of Road  Infrastructure,"south africa, as a developing country, has the responsibility to deliver developmental programmes such as reliable infrastructure, which could assist in the transportation of goods to other countries. road infrastructure is a necessary condition to economic growth. this study adopted a quantitative approach in order to investigate on a stakeholder’s perspective on the causes of poor service delivery of road infrastructure. structured questionnaires was circulated to 75 stakeholders in construction industry in gauteng province, which were registered with various approved councils, construction professionals and contractors such as civil engineers, project managers, directors, quantity surveyors, construction managers and resident engineers. 50 came back completed and eligible to use. random sampling method was used to select the respondents in various organizations. research findings revealed that community unrest and land proclamation were the highest ranked causes for poor service delivery. followed by, time, financial constraints, cash flow, lack of proper planning, resources, delivery of material, plant and equipment, shortage of skilled labourers, lack of equipment, lack of materials, performance guarantees, project duration/period, cost overruns were the major causes of poor service delivery of roads infrastructure according to stakeholders perspective. therefore, mitigating the causes would be by having proper management planning, skills transfer through ppp’s, proper communication channels and legality. it is recommended that road agencies (sanral,jra), municipality engagement should play a vital role in the service delivery and maintaining roads. in addition, quality work is encouraged in order to avoid rework and save time and cost, hence more roads can be constructed. good roads are an important aspect of society that could contribute to the african renaissance. moreover, roads contribute to poverty alleviation by promoting growth through provision of infrastructure in corridors that connects nations and access to land locked countries.",challenges,"Community unrest was the highest ranked factor which is a major concern to all stakeholder (client, consultants and contractors). Community unrest such as strikes, stoppage of project by business forums, councilors interruptions disrupt the project spending more time negotiations of the community grievances delay project and sometimes total abandonment of project sites is the biggest threat to road construction projects and causes poor service delivery. Moreover, the existing services and land proclamation also pose a huge challenge to delivering a project on time, it needs to be taken into consideration during early stage of the project. Therefore, proper planning, skills transfer and timeframe to respond would aid in the poor service delivery. Good communication with the various communities and different department must take place especial during the preliminary stage, and transparence, honesty must be key to every individual who is involved in the project. The Gauteng municipalities have the duty to carry out the routine maintenance and some of the municipalities can handle light construction activities such as rehabilitation of the road and resurfacing of the road. Therefore, the municipality must stop outsourcing rehabilitation of the road so as to decrease the budget expenditure unnecessary. Moreover, different municipalities need to increase their investment to roads infrastructure; provide long-term vision to maintain roads infrastructure. 10. Recommendations It is recommend that all three parties (client, consultant and contractor) should perform continuous training courses to improve capability of personnel and professionalism its encouraged to think out of the box. It is necessary for skills transfer to the youth as number of youth receive qualification without skills on the ground to use those qualifications on site. It’s recommended that companies and government sectors employ talented workforce to assist in skills transfer to benefit the organization. PPP’s would assist the government in the transfer of skills 1632","nokulunga xolile mashwama sustainable human settlement and construction research center, faculty of engineering and the built environment university of johannesburg 2028, south africa schwalicious@gmail.com didibhuku thwala; clinton aigbavboa sustainable human settlement and construction research center, faculty of engineering and the built environment university of johannesburg 2028, south africa (didibhukut, caigbavboa)@uj.ac.za","References

222,Factors That Influence Consumer Behavior In The Purchase  Of Durable Household Products,"manufacturing organizations strive to be the industry leaders with regard to the products and services they offer. in order for these organizations to become industry leaders, they should master the requirements of their customers. the purpose of this study was to identify the major factors which affect consumer buying behavior of durable household products in the kempton park region, which is located in the east-rand of johannesburg, south africa. the findings of the study will provide the manufacturer of durable household products with an indication of influencing factors when designing and developing their products. the influencing factors that were identified in this study include product quality, products features, cost of the product, brand reputation, advertisement and previous experience. questionnaires were used as a method for data collection and a non-random sample of 60 respondents were considered. this study was utilized as an opportunity to determine whether gender had an impact on purchasing behavior. hypothesis testing was used as a method of analysis, wherein it was found that product quality, product features and cost price are the most common determinants of consumer buying behavior. the findings further indicated that gender has no significant effect on their buying behavior. manufacturers could utilize the outcomes of this study and translate them into better, improved products in order to stay competitive.","consumer behavior, durable products, decision -making, groups","and Recommendation This study has proven that consumer preferences changes with a variety durable goods. The most important factors were founds to be features in television purchases, price in refrigerator purchases, quality in stove and other furniture purchases. For television purchases, 32% of the respondents considered features as their most inducing factor, 27% of the respondents want something that is durable and reliable (quality). There’s a bit of balance between cost price and quality as the considered factors when purchasing refrigerator. 32% of the respondents considered cost price whereas 30% considered quality. This makes both the variables equally important in this case. When making purchase on stove, 30% of the consumers considers quality as their most important factor. Consumers believe stove should always be in a functional state and last for longer period no matter the cost price. For other household furniture such as lounge suits, bedroom suits, etc. quality plays an important role in the eyes of radurability and reliability of the item. Quality is not only limited to durability and reliability, but also after sales service such as guarantee and warranty forms part of it. Features, cost price and quality were found to be the most dominating factor that influence the consumer buying decision. Therefore manufactures should strongly consider these three elements in order to sustain their business, increase market share and gain market superiority. Therefore consumer buying decision of durable goods is influenced by product quality, features, and cost price .The findings of this study have also statistically proven that female purchase decisions does not significantly differ from those of male at 95% confidence level. Therefore manufacturers don’t have to consider gender when designing their products.","elias thabiso mashao and nita sukdeo school of mechanical and industrial engineering department of quality and operations management university of johannesburg gauteng, south africa nsukdeo@uj.ac.za etmashao@gmail.com",
223,Supervision Of An Industrial Process Of Milk Production  Using Fuzzy Logic,"because we usually deal with real - world systems with real - world constraints (cost, computer resources, size, weight, power, heat dissipation, etc.), it is understood that the simplest method to accomplish a task is the one that should be used. experts usually rely on common sense when they solve problems. they also use vague and ambiguous terms. other experts have no difficulties with understanding and interpreting this statement because they have the background to hearing problems described like this. however, a knowledge engineer would have difficulties providing a computer with the same level of understanding. in a complex industrial process, how can we represent expert knowledge that uses vague and fuzzy terms in a computer to control it? in this work, the application is developed to control the pretreatment and pasteurization station of milk localized in batna (algeria) by adopting a control approach based on expert knowledge and fuzzy logic.","intelligent control, data acquisition","Presently, companies often require innovative solutions to make their plant operating systems function at peak efficiency. Using latest in equipment technology, resources, and materials. However, complex industrial processes are difficult to control because of inadequate knowledge of their behavior. This lack of knowledge is principally a lack of structural detail and it is this, which prevents the use of conventional control theory. However, a human operator who makes decisions based on inexact and linguistic measures of the process state often controls these processes with great skill. Fuzzy logic is considered as a superset of standard logic, which is extended to deal with the partial truth. It has become one of the most successful technologies for developing complex control systems. Fuzzy logic is a logic that describes fuzziness. As fuzzy logic attempts to model humans’ sense of words, decision-making and common sense, it is leading to more human intelligent machines. Therefore, it reflects how people think and attempts to model the sense of words and decisions. As a result, it is leading to new, more human, intelligent systems. Therefore, to improve control system reliability and availability, we implemented all solutions by creating a supervisory system, and we applicate different steps to ensure a fuzzy control of the system. The main objective of these solutions is to improve the old system. The solutions given are divided into two types. The first is a material solution and we proposed a feedback circuit implemented in each section with solenoid valves to automate the system. In addition, we proposed some equipment needed to implement the application. The second one is a software solution in where fuzzy logic has been used as a technique to control the milk production process. The augmented productivity in the factory, minimum downtime, reduced costs of maintenance are improved the advantages of our solutions.","hanane zermane, samira brahmi, naima zerari, rachad kasmi laboratory of automation and manufacturing, industrial engineering department university batna 2, batna, algeria hananezermane@yahoo.fr, brahmi.samira@gmail.com, n.zerari@yahoo.fr, kasmiradwan08@gmail.com",

225,A New Approach For Optimal Obsolescence Forecasting Based  On The Random Forest (Rf) Technique And Meta-Heuristic,"obsolescence is highly complex problem due to the influence of many factors such as competitive market pressure, technological advancement and short life cycle of technological components. basically, obsolescence problems are often sudden and not planned, causing delays and extra cost. to overcome this problem, forecasting appears to be one of the most efficient solutions. indeed, many studies have been conducted to create models that can effectively forecast obsolescence. in addition, applying machine learning techniques have attracted many attentions and have been widely used to predict obsolescence risk and life cycle. popular algorithms such as random forest, has been reporting satisfactory performance. to improve the accuracy of machine learning algorithms for obsolescence forecasting, this paper proposes a new optimization approach for obsolescence forecasting based on random forest (rf) and particle swarm optimization (pso). in fact, parameters optimization and features selection of rf have an important effect on it is predictive accuracy and pso presents one kind of effective method for rf parameters and features choosing. to examine the effectiveness of this approach, this paper presents a comparison between pso-rf and ga-rf (random forest based on genetic algorithm). experimental results show that pso-rf outperformed ga-rf with 96% of accuracy.","obsolescence, forecasting, optimization, machine learning, random forest","This paper presents an improved approach for obsolescence forecasting risk with a high degree of accuracy based on machine learning and meta-heuristic PSO. PSO search for the optimal parameter value for RF to obtain a subset of beneficial features. The optimal set features were adopted for the training and testing of RF model to improve the classification accuracy of the model. In order to validate this approach, PSO-RF was compared to RF and GA-RF. Experimental results show that PSO-RF outperformed GA-RF with 96% of accuracy. For future work, larger data with more features can give more accurate results. Other datasets and real-world problems for obsolescence forecasting can be tested using this approach. Other optimization algorithms can also be used, such as ant colony which is widely used for optimization, and compare it with the existing approach.","particle swarm optimization (pso) yosra grichi, thien-my dao and yvan beauregard department of mechanical engineering école de technologie supérieure montreal, h3c 1k3, canada yosra.grichi.1@ens.etsmtl.ca, thien-my.dao@etsmtl.ca, yvan.beauregard@etsmtl.ca",
226,Discrete Event Simulation For Chemotherapy Patient Flows  Dang Khoi Pham,"in oncology departments in hospitals, chemotherapy is one of the primary treatments besides radiotherapy and surgery. depending on the care protocol, patients need to visit the hospital several times to get the drug infusion which could take from 30 minutes to 8 hours. during a hospital appointment, patients go through procedures that may involve various hospital resources. due to the limited capacity of these resources as well as an increasing number of patients, long waiting times are quite common and cause a negative effect on the quality of care. in this study, we analyze the chemotherapy patient flows an oncology center in lille (col), france using discrete event simulation (des). this simulation study integrates numerous hospital resources as well as different sources of uncertainty to achieve a more practical model. the data for des are obtained from three sources: electronic health records, expert opinions, and a time study. the simulation results allow us to assess the performance of the current system at col based on two performance measures: average patient waiting time, and nurse utilization. this simulation work will also be used as a basis to evaluate scheduling algorithms proposed for col to improve chemotherapy patient flow and better utilize hospital resources.","chemotherapy, patient flows","and future works Patient waiting time in chemotherapy treatments is considerable in some cases and has a negative impact on the quality of care. This study uses DES to analyze the current system of an oncology center in Lille (France). The simulation model integrates various hospital resources and involved processes of chemotherapy patient flows. Simulation results show that the patient waiting time is mainly caused by two reasons: time for drug preparation and time for available chairs. Three policies are proposed to improve the performance of the current system: Simulation results show that Policy 3, which is a combination of Policy 1 and Policy 2, can reduce patient waiting time significantly. This simulation study is a baseline for future works of authors. In particular, the patient arrival rate can be solved optimally by combining simulation and a mathematical model to minimize the patient waiting time.","ieseg school of management, lem-cnrs (umr 9221), 3 rue de la digue, 59000 lille, france d.pham@ieseg.fr alejandra duenas icn business school (cerefige), 86 rue du sergent blandan, 54003 nancy, france alejandra.duenas@icn-artem.com christine di martinelly ieseg school of management, lem-cnrs (umr 9221), 3 rue de la digue, 59000 lille, france c.dimartinelly@ieseg.fr",
227,Desirability Function Approach For Selection Of Facility  Location: A Case Study,"the decision of facility location selection for a manufacturing organization affects for a long term on business profitability. this decision is based on many conflicting factors of tangible and intangible nature. location decision once taken is very difficult to be reversed for the organizations. therefore, facility location selection is predominant strategic decision domain for the manufacturing organizations. such complex decisions can be made by application of multi-criteria decision-making (mcdm) methods. various mcdm methods have previously been used to solve such problems. in this paper, a real time case study is presented for selection of the most suitable plant location site for a private sugar production unit using desirability function approach. this approach is based on a concept of determining global attractiveness of an alternative in the form of overall desirability. the estimated response models for different decision criteria are converted into individual desirability functions using exponential transformation process, that are further aggregated into a composite function. the results derived by using desirability function approach are then confirmed by application of utility concept method, which exactly corroborate with each other. additionally, single dimensional weight sensitivity analysis proves robustness of the results generated using this approach.",utility concept,"This paper presents a desirability function-based approach for facility location selection problem from a set of candidate alternatives in manufacturing environment. This method is based on the quality characteristic values of the considered location alternatives for arriving at the satisfactory results. The basic concept of desirability function is to convert a multi-objective problem into a single objective function with the consideration of overall desirability. This concept uses individual desirability and overall desirability. The higher value of overall desirability indicates the best alternative. One real time facility location selection example is considered to demonstrate the application competence and suitability of the proposed method. The result obtained using the desirability function-based method almost substantiate with those derived by utility theory method which signify that this method is an efficient approach as compared to other well established facility location selection methods like AHP, VIKOR, PROMETHEE, TOPSIS, ELECTRE etc in which most of these techniques either require very lengthy computations involving pair-wise comparisons or they need some preferential parameters to be defined which may be very complicated for the decision makers in practical situations. Also, a non-proportional weight sensitivity analysis is performed to examine the robustness of the proposed method.","prasad karande department of mechanical engineering, veermata jijabai technological institute, mumbai, india pmkarande@me.vjti.ac.in prasenjit chatterjee department of mechanical engineering, mckv institute of engineering, howrah, india prasenjit2007@gmail.com","references of the alternative

231,"Procedure For The Ergonomic Risks Management, With A  Process Approach, In Organizations","ergonomics is the science that studies the system integrated by the worker, the production means and the work environment, so that the work is efficient and appropriate to the psycho-physiological abilities of the worker, promoting their health and achieving their satisfaction (viña, 1985). in cuba there is an increase in the number of occupational accidents and diseases, and although there are no official data indicating a cause-effect relationship between these events and ergonomic risks, it is verified, in studies carried out, that these risks are not identified and have a high impact on the health and safety of workers. the ergonomic risk is the correlation between the probability of occurrence of adverse events and the severity of the effect on the worker, the organization and the environment, by the action of the hazards that limit the system worker-production means-labor environment (w-mp-e). therefore, the objective of the paper is to design a procedure for the ergonomic risks management, with a process approach, in organizations. the procedure follows the logic of the management cycle, allows the detection, evaluation and control of risks in the system w-mp-e, and proposes techniques and methods for this.",ergonomic risks,,"yolaine cisneros rodríguez faculty of business sciences and administration industrial engineering department university of holguin holguín, cuba yolaine.cisneros@uho.edu.cu miguel a. cisneros prieto research and postgraduate vice-rectory university of holguín holguín, cuba mcisneros@uho.edu.cu marisol pérez campaña faculty of business sciences and administration industrial engineering department university of holguín holguín, cuba mpc@uho.edu.cu claudia diaz leyva faculty of business sciences and administration industrial engineering department university of holguin holguín, cuba claudia.diaz@uho.edu.cu","References

233,Integrated Knowledge Loss Risk Management Model In The  Project Environment,"an analysis of modern approaches to knowledge management and risk management in project-oriented organizations is presented. an integrated knowledge loss risk management model is proposed that combines the main elements of the fraunhofer ipk knowledge management model and project risk management model in accordance with the pmbok methodology. the proposed model for project knowledge management is implemented through the identification, prioritization of the risk of loss of knowledge for the purpose of the project and its prevention.","risk management, model, project, knowledge","The paper has proposed a model that prevents the loss of critical knowledge of employees who, due to a number of reasons, can leave the organization (retirement, planned internal mobility, etc.). The integrated risk management model for loss of knowledge in the project environment combines knowledge and risk management components in the project, which allows identifying and preventing the risk of loss of knowledge in the project and thus reducing the negative impact on such key project indicators as cost, durability and quality. The model is used as a tool to support management decision making, a tool for planning and assessing the loss of knowledge in projects. In addition, the model allows to solve key issues regarding large volumes of newly created knowledge, access to informal knowledge of experts, and exchange of knowledge and best practices within the project and within the organization. The direction of further research is the development of tools for the preservation and dissemination of knowledge of those project participants who have high knowledge loss risk factors.","shteinbrekher daria management department national aerospace university “kharkiv aviation institute” chkalov str. 17, kharkiv, 61070, ukraine d.shteinbrekher@khai.edu",

235,Managing Capabilities For Research Centers In The Uk’S  Manufacturing Sector: From Literature Review To A Conceptual,"this study uncovers the knowledge gaps regarding the capability management of research centers in the uk manufacturing sector. the paper presents some key findings from systematic literature review and introduces a novel framework that will improve the decision making process related to capability development and strategy building which are the two main challenges for the uk manufacturing research centers. the findings presented in this paper highlight the need for and the key elements of such a framework and the benefits that it will bring to a research center’s capability management, e.g. more effective evaluation of capabilities and comprehensive understanding of development of those capabilities. it also identified knowledge gap related to management of technology capability from a research centre perspective. at the moment there is a lack of standardized framework (or approach) that is easy to use and applicable to research centres in the manufacturing sector. the paper presents findings from systematic literature review and introduces a novel framework that will improve the decision making process related to capability development and strategy building in the manufacturing research centers.","research centers, decision making","and Future Work This study focused on a research gap presented by a literature in relation to capability management by innovation providers. The systematic literature review provided evidence confirming that existing capability management approaches are not suitable for modern innovations providers applicable due to their complexity and time that is required to fill in all the information. Hence, this research gap introduced an opportunity to create a novel framework that will shorten the decision making process as well as provide reliable justifications to explain at which stage of development a capability is at. SLR also presented the distinction between tangible and intangible capabilities that are key for different aspects of work. By using information from SLR, it was possible to identify the gap and create a conceptual framework for the use of innovation providers in the manufacturing sector in the UK. Future work will focus on validation of the framework and the evaluation process. The scorecards will be presented to the decision makers of seven manufacturing research centers in the UK. After gathering valuable feedback, the scorecards will be modified. Afterwards, the framework will be tested on a short-term projects (at one research center at a time) in order to validate the framework further. This process will highlight which capabilities are used most frequently (or least frequently) at different research centers and also, what are the reasons behind it. Therefore, the validation process will bring an insight into which aspects all seven research centers share, and what should be modified further in order to make the framework applicable (and user friendly) for innovation providers in the manufacturing sector.","framework olga uflewska department of design, manufacture and engineering management, university of strathclyde, glasgow, 75 montrose st, glasgow g1 1xj, uk olga.uflewska@strath.ac.uk t.c. wong department of design, manufacture and engineering management, university of strathclyde, glasgow, 75 montrose st, glasgow g1 1xj, uk andy.wong@strath.ac.uk michael ward advanced forming research centre 85 inchinnan drive, inchinnan, renfrewshire, pa4 9lj, uk michael.ward@strath.ac.uk",
236,Conceptualization Of The Current Status  Of The Impact Evaluation Of Human,"in recent decades the organizational culture of human capital has grown as a valuable resource within organizations. that is why continuous training becomes the fundamental tool to achieve high levels of individual performance and compliance with business objectives. more and more resources are allocated to this process, and that is why it is overriding for companies to measure the effectiveness levels of training provided through the evaluation modalities and techniques. numerous authors have studied the subject, among which we can mention kirkpatrick (1976), tamkin (2002), garín sallan (1991, 1996, 1997, 1998, 2000, 2001, 2006 and 2010), pineda herrero (2000) and veredas (2005); others have proposed models and methodologies that include actions aimed at evaluating the training impact. in the cuban business world there is not an organizational culture focused on the evaluation of training impact. the incursions on this subject are limited and in many organizations the evaluation of training is not considered as a fundamental element to determine the profitability and effectiveness of it. this article proposes a brief overview of the current trends on the human resources training and their evaluation in organizations, the models analysis and methodologies on the subject and finally their panorama in cuba.","human resources, training",,"resources training in organizations claudia díaz leyva faculty of business sciences and administration industrial engineering department university of holguin holguin, cuba claudia.diaz@uho.edu.cu clara marrero fornaris manager head of university of holguin university of holguin holguin, cuba cmarrero@uho.edu.cu carlos nuñez cruz faculty of business sciences and administration industrial engineering department university of holguin holguin, cuba carlos.nunez @uho.edu.cu yolaine cisneros rodríguez faculty of business sciences and administration department of industrial engineering university of holguin holguín, cuba yolaine.cisneros@uho.edu.cu","References

239,Outsourcing Evolution And State-Of-The Art Practices:  Empirical Analysis Of Oil And Gas Industry,"s the evolution of outsourcing activities has changed the way firms compete across diverse industries. it has also enabled organisations to achieve both short and long term benefits. although there are advances in global logistics and information technology to increase the outsourcing of non-core operations, yet empirical testing of an association between technology and outsourcing in relation to long-term performance of organisations are less well researched. there is a general assumption in literature that employing outsourcing without proper consideration of long- term performance jeopardises competitiveness. this paper examines outsourcing in the oil and gas industry both from a long-term performance perspective, and from the viewpoint of technology deployment. the results indicate a strong correlation between technology adoption and effectiveness of outsourcing operations. in addition, the results demonstrate that the relationship between technology and outsourcing performance can be moderated through appropriate infrastructure, quality management and level of expertise across the organisation. proceedings of the international conference on industrial engineering and operations management paris, france, july 26-27, 2018 © ieom society international 3341",,,"nnamdi ogbuke school of business and enterprise university of central lancashire, preston pr1 2he",
240,Calculating The Effect Of Maintenance Human Error Factors  On Total Cost,"maintenance human error factors (mhf) are the conditions that can lead to a human error in maintenance, and have been widely acknowledged as major contributors to maintenance quality. these factors can have a significant effect on operating costs in industrial settings. however, there seems to be a scarcity of papers that aim to estimate the effect of improving these factors on both the maintenance quality and the total cost. the objective of this research is to provide a comprehensive framework to estimate this effect. the proposed framework utilizes a simulation model to establish the total cost associated with a preventive maintenance interval. our simulation case model consists of three systems in a series, each system consisting of two or three major components operating in parallel where one or two components must be operational at all times. a key feature of our simulation model is that we estimate the probability of component failure based on real failure data, integrated with mhf survey results. by using this simulation model the effect of modifying the mhf on total cost can be estimated. we believe 1809",,,"rogelio emmanuel jáuregui miramontes centre for management of technology and entrepreneurship chemical engineering & applied chemistry university of toronto 200 college street toronto, ontario · m5s 3e5 · canada rogelio.jaureguimiramontes@mail.utoronto.ca yuri a. lawryshyn centre for management of technology and entrepreneurship chemical engineering & applied chemistry university of toronto 200 college street toronto, ontario · m5s 3e5 · canada yuri.lawryshyn@utoronto.ca",
241,Vulnerability Analysis Of Water Distribution Networks  Using Betweenness Centrality And Information Entropy,"in recent years, many researchers have analysed the vulnerability of water distribution networks (wdns) from the hydraulic perspective. however, few works in literature have addressed the vulnerability problem from the topological point of view. this work adopts the information entropy to evaluate the topological vulnerability of a wdn from the character of its heterogeneity. the proposed method is based on the principle that a network with uniformly distributed centrality values exhibits a lower drop in performance in the case of partial failure of its components and therefore is less vulnerable. in order to demonstrate the proposed method, the paper presents two case studies, a real-world wdn of an australian town and a network from the literature. comparative analysis confirmed that a network with more homogeneous distribution of the nodal betweennes centrality values is less vulnerable against the random failure of its components than that of the one with heterogeneous distribution of these values.",,"The present paper attempts to fill the gap surrounding the topological vulnerability analysis of WDNs. In doing so, we introduce a two-step procedure for quantifying the vulnerability by integrating the centrality analysis and the entropy theory. In the first step, the paper evaluates the degree of influence of a node by employing a graph theory quantity known as the betweenness centrality. In the second step, this work has drawn attention to the information entropy as a tool to measure the homogeneity and heterogeneity of the betweenness centrality values, computed in the first step. This article generates a new vulnerability index as a measure of the global vulnerability of WDNs. The new vulnerability index is developed from the information entropy based on the distribution of the normalized betweenness centrality values. The new index measures the severity of the consequences of the random nodal failures. The vulnerability analysis results showed that the failure of a highly central node leads to a significant loss of the performance in the network. Using two case studies, a tree-shaped WDN and a looped network from the literature, this paper has demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method. As the previous discussion attests, the proposed vulnerability analysis method is in consistent with the intuitive notion of vulnerability. As part of the first practical implication, the maintenance strategy based on the vulnerability analysis proposed herein will provide an expert facilitator that helps water utilities to identify and prioritize the vulnerabilities. The second practical implication is especially valuable for designing an effective risk management framework, which allows for least cost decisions to be made for the protection of the WDNs. This article contributes to the vulnerability analysis of water distribution network by coupling the centrality analysis and the entropy theory. However, the conventional centrality measures rely only on the topological information. As such, these measures only partially describe a network structure and therefore cannot entirely characterize its properties. Further research might seek to develop a domain specific centrality metrics taking into account the topological along with the hydraulic attributes of the nodes in the network.","seyed ashkan zarghami, indra gunawan, frank schultmann entreprenueurship, commercialisation& innovation center (ecic) the university of adelaide adelaide, australia ashkan.zarghami@adelaide.edu.au, indra.gunawan@adelaide.edu.au, frank.schultmann@adelaide.edu.au",
242,The Relationship Between Internal And  External Integration Of Supply Chain And,"supply chain integration divided into two dimensions, namely internal integration, and external integration. internal integration refers to cross-functional intra-firm collaborative processes. external integration consists of supplier integration, customer integration, and logistics service providers integration. empirically, supply chain integration is more dominant in investigating the relationship between internal, supplier, customer integration, and operational performance. the studies that investigate the relationship between logistics service providers integration and operational performance is still limited in number. therefore, this paper aims to examine the relationship between internal, supplier, customer and logistics service providers integration and operational performance of the organization in the form of propositions. this paper is a conceptual framework. supplier integration positively associated with inventory control processes and new product development. customer integration increases the accuracy of forecasting. the logistics service providers integration positively associated with logistics activities. the dimensions of operational performance can be measured based on variable cost, quality, flexibility, delivery. the organization's operational performance proves to be a positive consequence of internal integration and external integration of supply chain. this paper proposes the proposition that there is a positive relationship between internal and external integration with the operational performance of the organization.",supply chain,,"operational performance yandra rahadian perdana department of industrial engineering - faculty of science and technology sunan kalijaga state islamic university yogyakarta, indonesia and department of management - faculty of economics and business universitas gadjah mada yogyakarta, indonesia yandra.perdana@uin-suka.ac.id wakhid slamet ciptono department of management - faculty of economics and business universitas gadjah mada yogyakarta, indonesia wakhidsciptono@ugm.ac.id kusdhianto setiawan department of management - faculty of economics and business universitas gadjah mada yogyakarta, indonesia s.kusdhianto@ugm.ac.id",
243,Introducing Statistical Process Control Techniques Into A  Headliner Subassembly Process,"customer demand is a constantly changing variable that suppliers must be able to accommodate to stay in business. being able to properly assess the output of a process is key to determining capability. the focus of this paper is to determine and improve the quality level of a headliner manufacturing line using statistical quality control tools. it will analyze observational data to determine whether the process is in control and measure the capability of the process to meet an increased demand. qc tools such as control charts, analysis of variance (anova) and pareto analysis will be used as the means for collecting and analyzing data, measuring the results and then identifying root causes. these tools will then be used to identify how to improve the process to meet the demand.","control chart, sigma level","Using the statistical analysis tools, we were able to determine that the headliner process is highly out of control. More importantly, it is incapable of meeting the newly increased demand at its current scrap rate. The increased demand requires a sigma performance level of 2.912. The current process misses this performance by about 10 parts per shift. In manufacturing, you must above all be able to meet the demand of the customer. It is also necessary keep the scrap rate low enough so that costs are not paid out of pocket. Currently, this process is unable to do either. The company is losing an average of more than $950,000 a year due to scrap. To improve the line’s yield, we made modifications to the process to achieve significant improvements to the process in multiple areas as identified in the Pareto analysis. However, there will still need to be changes made to reach the necessary quality level. It is unlikely that we will eliminate 100% of the defects mentioned even with error-proofing so further analysis into the defect causes will need to be done to decrease scrap to a reasonable level for the line.

246,Decision Making Models For Managing Performance Using  Influence Diagrams: A Solution For Single Vs Multi Strategy,"to maintain a competitive edge in the market, it is important for a company to track and manage its performance. performance management is the next vital step after measuring and monitoring performance. maintaining an acceptable level of performance is a result of performance management. a company can achieve this goal by focusing and improving on those key performance indicators (kpis) which are of utmost importance to the company; in other words, focusing on the kpis which are mostly aligned with the company’s long term strategies. accordingly, this paper proposes a model to aim the decision making process in identifying such kpis. the model is developed as an influence diagram (id). two ids are proposed. one for a company based on a single strategy and the other for the use of companies seeking to fulfil multi-strategies within their operations. the ids proposed in this paper will aim decision makers to choose the right strategy or a portfolio of strategies for their company which returns the maximum expected utility (meu). the framework is based on capturing the key performance indicators and selecting the kpi or a portfolio of kpis which returns the meu to the company.","influence diagrams, decision support","and discussion In this paper, a novel method is proposed to manage performance in an organization. The proposed methodology is based on capturing the most important Key Performance Indicators and building an Influence Diagram as a tool for managing performance. The Influence Diagram considers the state of each KPI and based on that, calculates the expected utility for each decision alternative. The alternatives include the decision on whether to invest on improving a KPI or not. Based on the designed Influence Diagram and the output of the model, we showed that the organization can chose the best KPI to invest on, which is also expected to return the maximum utility to the organization, when compared to the expected utility of other KPIs. Alternatively, based on the same results, the organization is able to conduct a fair resource allocation among a portfolio of KPIs. For future research, a Dynamic Bayesian Network may be proposed for managing performance in different time slots based on the Influence Diagram designed in this paper.","organizations mohammad hassan abolbashari, atefe zakeri and elizabeth chang school of business university of new south wales canberra, australia m.abolbashari@student.unsw.edu.au, a.zakeri@student.unsw.edu.au, e.chang@unsw.edu.au",

248,Achieving Procurement Excellence Through A Bayesian Network  Modelling Approach,"procurement as one of the activities in supply chain management has recently received great attention from researchers due to it not just being a support function, but a key strategic tool for organizations to build their competitive advantage. although the different stages that come under the purchasing process (such as initiation, planning and monitoring) have been studied in the literature extensively, they are done in isolation and not by taking the overall purchasing goal into consideration. this drawback and the inefficacy and ineffectiveness of the current purchasing practices are highlighted in the literature by several reports and research publications and they stress on the need to have better procurement practices to achieve savings of millions of dollars per year. considering the inefficiency of the current fragmented approaches towards improving purchasing practices, this research aims to take a defragmented approach towards this strategic activity by including all of the key variables that affect the quality of purchasing into one single mathematical model. using such an approach, the objective is to enlighten a buyer with the required information by which informed procurement decisions can be taken and transform him/her to a smart buyer. this mathematical approach towards purchasing will enable us to understand the key variables that affect purchasing, as well as their interdependencies and how they affect the level of a buyer’s smartness. the research will provide a smart buyer enabler framework towards improving purchasing practices in supply chains. research issues • lack of a comprehensive model that includes all variables at the same time. • no evidence of a measurable metric for procurement performance. • the interdependencies between kpis have not been considered. • the effect of any step towards improvement could not be expressed. • no framework for trade-off analysis exists when objectives are contradictory. objectives providing a mathematical model to measure procurement performance capturing a comprehensive set of kpis for procurement performance broadening the smart buyer concept by providing a measurable definition providing a pathway to transform a buyer into a smart buyer enabling procurement decision making when objectives are contradictory method my research method includes the three following stages which have also been described in fig 4. stage 1: quantifying the current level of smartness stage 2: adjusting the kpis to achieve an optimum level of smartness given the current resources stage 3: recommendations and scenario planning towards achieving procurement excellence model in the first stage of the methodology, the relevant kpis and the interdependencies between them have been mapped as follows: results conclusions • procurement kpis have different levels of impact in achieving procurement excellence. some kpis are more effective and critical while others have a smoother impact on the overall outcome. • procurement excellence doesn’t necessarily require excellency in all kpis. a proper combination of excellent, competent and good kpis will result into a satisfactory level of procurement performance. stage 1 stage 2 stage 3 step 1: identifying kpis step 2: considering

but also there is no sign that the primary objective of procurement which is fulfilling effectiveness is being met. effectiveness and efficiency levels are indicating an unacceptable level of procurement performance and at this stage, the final product or service is not delivered to the end user. acceptable effectiveness of procurement practices are almost half way met, therefore efficiency could not be achieved for an acceptable level. the kpis that are used for measuring effectiveness are showing just an acceptable level of effectiveness and since effectiveness is a pre-requisite for efficiency, the efficiency level is low. good kpis are showing a reasonable performance. however, they have not been adjusted nor analysed for a better outcome. the cause and effects that are caused by the interdependencies between the kpis are not considered for further improvements. competent procurement practices are successful and almost efficient. however, further/final improvements towards procurement excellence could be made. effectiveness of procurement practices has been thoroughly met; however efficiency could still be improved. given a fixed amount of resources available, different kpis are adjusted and aligned with each other so that the maximum achievable level of performance is obtained. excellent at this stage, not only effectiveness of the procurement practices is at the highest achievable level, but also efficiency of the procurement operations is at the highest achievable level. performance measures and their interdependencies are monitored every day and are analysed for further improvements. in the next section, this network is simulated in bayes server software and the level of smartness is eventually calculated. given the level of smartness, we then have to refer to our procurement performance matrix to interpret our results. by inserting the current values of the kpis into the model, the current level of smartness is obtained and results are then interpreted through our performance matrix. the current performance is not good. the required values for the kpis to achieve procurement excellence are as follows. the results provide insights for managers and decision makers towards achieving procurement excellence. fig 6. procurement excellence",,,mohammad abolbashari school of business,

The plants growing along seashores are abundant and the thick aerial roots can withstand salt spray, drought and strong winds. The paper and related experimental research show the advantages of resin polymers as matrixes for composite materials and discuss the technological challenges encountered during the preparation. Emphasis is placed on thermal and chemical treatment of fibers in order to reduce the water content and the necessity of curing in dry boxes for preparing isotropic composite materials. Laboratory-scale tensile and torsion testing machines were employed during the experimental research in order to establish allow the experimental establishment of yield strength, Young modulus E and shear modulus G with remarkable precision. The strength properties of the newly created composite material were used to create a new material entry into the database of materials of the 3D CAD platform used for simulations. Finite Element Modeling under SolidWorks allowed the investigation of the stresses and displacements developed under tensile and torsion static loads.

251,Failure Of Francis Water Turbines Due To Flow Variations In  Papua New Guinea,essential variations in water flow combined with erosion affect most small francis water turbines installed by small communities across papua new guinea. the authors evaluate the effects of harmonically excited vibrations under variable flow conditions and propose design optimization of shafts. the stiffness depreciation of shafts under erosion is also considered and its effects are evaluated by finite element methods.,flow variation,"The design, development and maintenance of Francis turbines are site related. Water flow variations and erosion due to the sediment impact influence the vibrational behaviour of the system rotor – stator. The waterfalls at Busama community are fed by fluids crossing mountain ranges rich in quartz particles, due to the vicinity of gold fields. The variations in flow at the waterfalls are related to seasonal variations of the rainfalls and the flow rates in summer months can go down to 60% of flow rates in winter time. Such variations are important for a cast turbine affected by erosion because the vibrational amplitudes reach magnitudes potentially able to annihilate the geometrical clearance between the rotor and the stator and bring failure. The investigations of the authors of this paper also noted the failure of the trust bearings supporting the rotor. It can be safely concluded that Francis turbines cannot be recommended as micro-hydro plants for small communities due to the high cost of equipment, site-related design complexities, lack of qualified service and long waiting time for spare parts.","nicholas lambrache department of mechanical engineering png university of technology morobe, papua new guinea nicholas.lambrache@pnguot.ac.pg, nicholas.lambrache@alefphotonics.com john pumwa department of mechanical engineering png university of technology morobe, papua new guinea john.pumwa@pnguot.ac.pg dapsy olatona department of applied physics png university of technology morobe, papua new guinea dapsy.olatona@pnguot.ac.pg mihail ursul department of mathematics and computer science png university of technology morobe, papua new guinea mihail.ursul@pnguot.ac.pg brian n’drelan department of mechanical engineering png university of technology morobe, papua new guinea brian.ndrelan@pnguot.ac.pg",
252,Preventive Maintenance Optimisation: Towards A New Model,"in a competitive environment, the most successful companies are those that well manage their projects defining the right map to achieve their goals and optimizing the triptych “cost-quality-time limit”. considering preventive maintenance as a lean project, we propose managing its steps through a lean model integrating a useful decisional algorithm to select the appropriate ndt (non-destructive testing) techniques in the step “method” under the “optimisation” phase of our model. the implantation of our proposed model allows the early prediction and prevention of equipment breakdowns and so the redaction of unnecessary costs.","ndt, lean, optimisation","The majority of production systems are often penalized by the maintenance costs related to equipment failures and sudden breakdowns; this derives from the maintenance management strategies that are more oriented towards the curative strategies than the preventive ones. In order to deal with this issue and we have developed a generic Lean maintenance optimization model. In our approach, we discuss the deployment of a decision algorithm on NDT techniques in the ""methods"" step, which could reduce the number of unforeseen failures.","salima hammadi laboratory of industrial technology, faculty of sciences and technologies, sidi mohamed ben abdellah university, fez, morocco salimahammadi1a@gmail.com amal boukili laboratory of industrial technology, faculty of sciences and technologies, sidi mohamed ben abdellah university, fez, morocco amal@gmail.com boukili.amal@gmail.com brahim herrou superior school of technology/ laboratory of industrial technology, faculty of sciences and technologies, sidi mohamed ben abdellah university, fez, morocco brahimherrou@yahoo.fr mohammed el hammoumi laboratory of industrial technology, faculty of sciences and technologies, sidi mohamed ben abdellah university, fez, morocco m_elhammoumi@yahou.fr",
253,Methodology For Optimizing The Use Of Ndt In Predictive  Maintenance,"in order to avoid the problems that could be slow down and even stop the production, the company must adopt a strategy of maintenance of all equipment throughout their life cycle, which aims are: better management, organization, equipment control and anomaly detection as well as accurate diagnosis of malfunctions. besides, a bad the nasty maintenance program could be prevented in increased production rates and poor business development, where the maintenance program must move towards predictive maintenance, which contains many ndt (non-destructive testing) techniques such as vibratory analysis, thermography, ultrasonic, radiography, penetrant testing and magnetoscopy. therefore, the choice of an ndt technique among others on the nature of the physical parameter has to be monitored and according to the criteria of speed, cost, reliability, ease, and safety of each technique. moreover, some components, have seen that several ndts can be used, in order to optimize the use and the costs related to these ndts. thus; the present work consists of proposing a new methodology for ranking ndt techniques based on priorities. nevertheless, the proposed methodology has proven its robustness in the study case part of one of the workshops of a phosphoric office.","ndt, methodology","In this work we have developed a new methodology of optimization of the use NDT techniques in predictive maintenance where our recommended methodology is based on four complementary phases, namely as follow: Identify all the NDTs to be classified, establish a list of priority criteria, evaluate the performance of each NDT technique and classify NDTs according to their overall scores. Therefore; a precise description of each phase of our methodology has been provided in this paper. Moreover, we have recommended the use of this methodology in addition to the principles and tools of improvement and planning of a preventive maintenance policy. In order to exploit and validate our proposed approach, a case study was conducted in one of the workshops of a phosphoric office. Thereby, this case study has highlighted the importance of the use of techniques. Although, the vibration analysis is the most widely used since the majority of equipment consists of mechanical systems, but the use of other techniques NDT sometimes completes the latter, hence the need for an approach allowing the choice of the most appropriate technique based on the indicators and physical quantities by a thorough analysis and operating conditions of the process studied.","amal boukili, mohammed el hammoumi and said haouache laboratory of industrial techniques (lti), faculty of science and technology (fst) sidi mohammed ben abdellah university fes, morocco amal-boukili@usmba.ac.ma , m_elhammoumi@yahou.f and s.haouache66@gmail.com",

255,The Microfinance Institutions Rating According To The  Performance Of Their Lending Process: An Intuitionistic,"the main reason for the microfinance industry is to reduce poverty. however, recent research suggests that this objective was not always respected; the microfinance institutions (mfis) focus more on their financial sustainability and profitability rather than on customer, which is a mission drift from their original objective. several processes are designed within the mfis to allow the production of the services and its distribution to the beneficiaries, managing these processes effectively and efficiently may improve the social and economic conditions of the borrowers and enhance the mfis sustainability and competitiveness. this study aims to rank and prioritize the mfis according to the performance of their lending process. such study may allow mfis to understand their position compared to their market rivals and then to seek differential advantages for retaining their customers and attracting new ones. measuring the microfinance lending process (mlp) performance is a precondition for its analysis and subsequently its improvement. however, collecting data on lending process within an mfi is not always easy. therefore, we managed to develop an intuitionistic fuzzy topsis approach. it is a complex decision making (dm) tool that is highly recommended to deal with uncertainty and vagueness in comparative analysis.",m.,,"fuzzy topsis evaluation yousef lamrani alaoui and tkiouat mohamed ifelab-laboratory of studies and research in applied mathematics mohamed v university of rabat mohammadia school of engineering, morocco yousseflamrani@research.emi.ac.ma, tkiouat@emi.ac.ma",

This paper aims to shed light on the security problems encountered, and especially on those that hinder the proper functioning of big data processing systems during their work. For these reasons, we tried to present through this paper as a solution to the problems mentioned, the application of an algorithm in the Map reduce, part of the Hadoop ecosystem, which is responsible for parallel processing in real time.

258,Dynamic Programming Approach To Unit Commitment  Problem For Kuwait Power Generations,"optimization techniques are becoming essential in the field of power systems. in this paper, two dynamic programming (dp) optimization methods were used to solve a large-scale problem which is known as the unit commitment problem (ucp). a sample of ten generating units that forms one power station in kuwait was chosen to be tested. this paper aims to have a schedule with the least possible electricity production cost while meeting the hourly demand in addition to other system constraints and this is what is known as ucp. a matlab code was used to generate solutions for the ten-unit system. the results showed that the conventional dp method reduced the cost by 36.1% while priority dp method reduced the cost by 35%. since the future newkuwait vision is introducing renewable energy resources to the power system, solving the ucp will be the first step towards reaching the vision.",,"The aim of this paper is to apply optimization methods to a real-life problem which is the power system in this case. The focus was based on optimizing the generators by reducing the total production cost. Different methods were explained with their advantages and disadvantages; the discussion part of the paper included both theoretical and numerical considerations to optimize the problem. The results were translated into tables and graphs to compare the applied methods and reach the optimum solution. These tables and graphs were then explained in detail in the discussion section where economic goals were satisfied through minimizing the total production operating cost. Dynamic programming was proven to be an efficient way to solve the unit commitment problem and such a method will make a huge difference when implementing it in Gulf Cooperation Council countries in general and in Kuwait in specific. It was verified that solving the unit commitment problem is an effective, innovative and creative way in the power systems field and this paper is concluded to be successful and is able to be implemented. 1945","nadine awadah, rawan alshikh ali, shaikha albaijan, ghalia al-qallaf, muneerah al- hassawi, and suat kasap industrial engineering department college of engineering and technology american university of the middle east - aum egaila, kuwait suat.kasap@aum.edu.kw","References

260,Scenario Reduction Approach For A Resilient Supply Chain  Network,"disruptions may occur in supply chains because of internal or external factors. internal factors and especially paths disruptions between supply chain elements are considered in this paper. for employing resiliency and mitigation of disruption risks in a supply chain, three policies including backup capacity at suppliers, safety stock for each path, and using several suppliers are considered. a nonlinear two stage stochastic programming model is presented with adopting resilient strategies. various scenarios were generated by considering disruptions in different paths. considering all scenarios during solving the model will increase the computational time. to decrease the computational time efficiently, a sampling method can be used. in this paper different methods of sampling strategies were analyzed and compared for a three echelon supply chain problem. the best method was determined based on the ability of the method to lead us to accurate estimation with less computational time. also the results confirm necessity of resilient stochastic consideration of the problem. adopting resilient strategies reveal increasing profit versus non-resilient supply chain when disruptions occur. the scenario reduction schemes can improve the applicability of network designs in an uncertain environment.","disruption, mitigation risk, sampling methods","In this paper, the considered supply chain confronts with disruptions that occurs in linking paths. For restoring to normal condition, resilient strategies are analyzed and the computational results present when disruptions occur the profit of supply chain with resilient strategies is more than non-resilient one egregiously. The differences of profit between resilient and non-resilient supply chain is growing when the probability of disruptions are increased. Disruptions in supply chain causes different scenarios, by growth in number of scenarios the computational effort increases dramatically. To deal with this complexity that faces the problem by increasing in number of scenarios, we present sampling schemes that calculates approximation of objective function value with reduced number of scenarios. In this paper, model C is proposed that selects the best scheme in each simulated instance. By using model C, the scheme with less approximate error and CPU time is determined. The computational results indicate the importance of selecting the best schemes by illustrating profit differences between proper scheme and improper one. If preferences enter in the problem the results represent that the third scheme is the most proper when CPU time is more important. Disruptions of supply chain facilities as well as disruptions in other echelons can be considered as a direction for future research. Adopting other resilient strategies such as storing semi-manufactured products in manufacturer can be considered as another direction for the future works.","zahra moghimi department of industrial engineering shahed university tehran, iran zahra.moghimi@shahed.ac.ir mahdi bashiri department of industrial engineering shahed university tehran, iran bashiri@shahed.ac.ir",
261,Robust Hub Location Problem With Uncertain Inter Hub Flow  Discount Factor,"hub location problem seeks to find the optimal location of hub facilities and allocate demand points to them for transferring of demands between origin and destination points. this paper is aimed to model the uncapacitated multiple allocation hub location problem in an uncertain environment. first, a deterministic model of uncapacitated multiple allocation hub location is introduced, then a robust optimization approach is used for dealing with uncertain parameters. the mathematical formulation of the considered problem is developed with uncertainty in demands, hub establishment fixed cost and inter hub flow discount factor (α). by means of an uncertainty budget, the level of conservatism is controlled. the counterpart models are compared with each other using well known cab and ap data sets with different levels of uncertainty. the results show that with increasing of the uncertainty, more hubs will be established with presence of demands uncertainty, while it is decreased when establishment cost or inter hub flow discount factor has uncertainty nature.","hub location, robust, uncertainty","In this paper, three robust multiple allocation hub location models are introduced. Demands, hub establishment fixed costs and inter hub flow discount factor (α) are considered as uncertain parameters. These models are solved by considering different levels of uncertainties and different uncertainty budgets. Results show that more hubs are needed in the presence of uncertain demands, while it is decreased when establishment cost or inter hub flow discount factor has an uncertain nature. Decision maker can set the level of uncertainty budget and can increase or decrease the level of risk. Level of risk is increased when uncertainty budget has value close to zero and conversely. If uncertainty is not considered in the model and later this appear at the model have a lot cost because of wrong decision at the first. It is interesting for future research to consider combination of uncertain parameter in the model instead of considering individual uncertain parameters. Using decomposition based algorithms to solve medium scale problems can be another direction for future studies.","reza rahmati department of industrial engineering shahed university tehran, iran reza.rahmati@shahed.ac.ir mahdi bashiri department of industrial engineering shahed university tehran, iran bashiri@shahed.ac.ir",
262,"An Eoq Inventory Model For Items Consisting Of Components* Nadezhda Kozlovskaya1, Nadezhda Pakhomova1, Knut Richter1",": a deterministic inventory model with constant demand and return on the base of economic order quantity (eoq) is considered. we consider a firm that can manufacture new products and recover the value of a used product through remanufacturing with dismantling for components. the firm provides product at a constant demand rate. product consists of two components. each part is manufactured separately and placed in inventory, then two components are assembled. the dismantling operation yields two spare components. products are returned according to the return rate, other products are disposed of. the returned product is dismantled for components, any part is inspected whether it is usable or not and then is placed in inventory. both components are usable at the different rate. the usable components are then remanufactured or directly reused, other components are disposed of.","reverse logistics, remanufacturing, implementing","Inventory policies for joint remanufacturing and manufacturing have recently received much attention. Most efforts,though, were related to (optimal) policy structures and numerical optimization, rather than closed form expressions for calculating near optimal policy parameters. The focus of this paper is on the latter. We consider a case of a firm that can manufacture new products and recover the value of a used product through remanufacturing with dismantling for components. The cost structure consists of setup costs, switching cost, holding costs and eoq non related costs. Theorem from the section 3 presents simple, closed form formulae for approximating the optimal policy parameters under a cost minimization objective. The numerical examples were considered, which demonstrated the alteration of the optimal policy under different values of the initial parameter ceteris paribus. It also demostrates that the dependency of total average cost from other parameters of the model can be rather complex, which is the consequence of integer optimal numbers of optimal policy.","1 saint petersburg state university, universitetskaya nab 7/9, 199034, st. petersburg, russia email addresses: nvk: n.kozlovskaya@spbu.ru nvp: n.pahomova@spbu.ru kr: k.rihter@spbu.ru",
263,Improvement Of Diabetes Awareness:  Applying Six Sigma To Increase Teachers Awareness Regarding,"six sigma dmaic is a methodology used by business organizations to improve their processes by controlling and reducing variation. in this project, an attempt is made to apply and implement six sigma to increase teacher’s awareness regarding diabetic children in primary schools. at first, a pilot test was conducted to identify and prove the existence of problem. the results revealed that 45% of teachers did not know the symptoms of hypoglycemia where 20% of them faced more than 6 cases of diabetic pupils in the schools. voice of the customer (voc) was then gained through a parent survey. the critical to quality (ctq) was then identified as well as the define phase was then completed. moreover, the teacher’s current performance level was measured by distributing a knowledge test and the results discovered that the performance level is 57.7%. therefore, the team decided to focus on increasing teacher’s awareness by at least 30%. several tools such as quality function deployment (qfd) and failure mode effect analysis (fmea) were implemented in both the analyze and measure phases, then the most effective improvements were identified. an educational awareness program was then conducted to introduce teachers to the most important information required to handle a diabetic child. subsequently, another knowledge test was distributed to identify the improvements in the scores of the teachers. the results, revealed that the awareness level increased from 57.7% to 89.9%, and dpmo reduced from 476190 to 238095. finally, the control phase was completed through introducing an action plan that would maintain the improvements made for more years to come.","diabetes, six sigma, dmaic","Six Sigma with DMAIC was successfully implemented in the study to increase teacher’s awareness regarding diabetic children in primary schools. All the solutions implemented are resulted in increasing the awareness level of teacher from 57% to 89%. Where sigma level is increased from 1.55 to reached 2.21, therefore the DPMO changed from 476190 to 238095. The same effort can be applied through all the primary schools in Kuwait to achieve higher and improved sigma levels.

266,A Self-Starting Risk-Adjusted Aft-Based Control Chart For  Monitoring The Survival Time Of Patients,"since the processes in the health-care domain deal with humans' life, the slightest deviation from the normal state can lead to irreparable damages to individuals and society. therefore, monitoring the quality of the processes in this area has attracted many researchers’ attention. on the other hand, the introduction of new therapies for various diseases has made process monitoring difficult due to the lack of historical data. in this paper, the effect of heterogeneity of patient conditions (including gender, age, etc.) and treatment in different conditions (such as treatment with different therapist groups) has been considered using the accelerated failure time (aft) regression model and the risk of each patient has been adjusted accordingly. then, survival times of patients are monitored using a control chart based on the residual values of the aft regression. performance of the proposed control chart is evaluated using the average run length (arl) criterion. the results indicate that the proposed method has a proper performance in identifying out-of-control status in processes in the health-care domain. the results showed that taking into account the therapist groups as well as increasing the number of in-control observations, increase the ability of the proposed control chart to detect shifts in the process.","average run length, censoring, risk adjustment","and suggestion for future research In this paper, considering the residuals of the AFT risk-adjusted model as a statistic, a self-starting control chart was proposed to monitor the process in the field of health-care. The results show that the proposed method has an acceptable performance in identifying shifts in the process especially when the regression coefficients have been estimated with more in-control data. More researches should be done on the monitoring of self-starting control charts especially with continuous survival data. For example, investigating the other distributions rather than Weibull or developing a self-starting control based on likelihood ratio test can be fruitful area for future research.","elahe tighkhorshid department of industrial engineering shahed university tehran, iran e.tighkhorshid@shahed.ac.ir amirhossein amiri department of industrial engineering shahed university tehran, iran amiri@shahed.ac.ir farzad amirkhani department of industrial engineering shahed university tehran, iran fzd.amirkhani@shahed.ac.ir",

272,Comparative Assessment Of Conventional And Alternative Leather Tanning  Processes From A Life Cycle Perspective,"the environmental impact of leather processing is an area of increasing interest for consumers and legislators. the popular chromium salt tanning, which holds the lion share of total world leather production, is under pressure for environmental concern. the new so -called cleaner tanning agents such as aluminium, titanium, zirconium, and aldehydes set out to avoid the use of chromium salts. various alternative systems have been developed but not yet assessed in terms of quantitative environmental impact assessment. we selected tanning process using agents such as chrome (conventional), aluminium and aldehydes and attempted to understand corresponding environmental impacts from a life cycle perspective. one (1) m2 of leather was chosen as the functional unit. the direct input profile consists of pickled pelt as raw material for all three processes, chemicals, water, and energy. the main outputs are tanned leather (chrome/alum or aldehyde), wastewater and solid wastes. also, a comparative analysis was done to show whether there are significant variations in the mechanical properties such as tensile strength, tear strength, and softness; hydrothermal properties such as shrinkage temperature. moreover, an analysis of the physical and chemical properties of wastewater emissions from the tanning processes was performed. the wastewater samples were analysed for chloride, chemical oxygen demand (cod), biochemical oxygen demand (bod), ammonia (nh3-n), nitrite (no2-n),nitrate (no3-n), total kjeldahl nitrogen (tkn), phosphate (po 4), sulphate (so4), total chromium (total cr), chromium (as cr 6+), total solids (ts), and total dissolved solids (tds). impact 2002+ method has been used under the framework of the simapro software to measure the environmental burden of the studied systems. the comparative results show that aluminium tanning process has more than 13 times the higher impact on aquatic ecotoxicity, 4.43 times higher on aquatic acidification than chrome tanning process. also, aluminium tanning has terrestrial ecotoxicity. in contrast, chrome tanning has a marginally higher value of non-carcinogens. besides, aldehyde tanning had a significantly higher impact on aquatic ecotoxicity. the mechanical properties of aluminium and aldehyde tanned leathers were found to exhibit no significant differences from the leather tanned using traditional method (chrome tanned). however, the softness and hydrothermal stability of chrome tanned leather are much higher than that of aldehyde and aluminium tanned leather. these findings will pave the way for setting up priorities in abatement measures and will ultimately aid in achieving sustainability leather production in bangladesh. 2070 proceedings of the 2nd european conference on industrial engineering and operations management (ieom) paris, france, july 26-27, 2018",,,"zia uddin md. chowdhury1, md. ariful islam juel2, and md. abul hashem3 1,2,3department of leather engineering, khulna university of engineering & technology, khulna, bangladesh, ziachowdhury@le.kuet.ac.bd; juel_islam@le.kuet.ac.bd; mahashem@le.kuet.ac.bd",

274,Use Of Data Mining And Neural Network Algorithms To  Optimize The Implementation Of Value Engineering In Projects,"the value methodology that is commonly known as “value engineering” is a systematic group problem- solving method that has been used for more than fifty years. in a brief review of its application process, consisting of three steps of pre-study, value study and post-study, it is inferred from its structure that various types of knowledge are created during the cycle of its implementation. due to the different nature of the process of a value study and the resultant production of various types of knowledge with a different structure, we need to use strategies that help us to discover and extract a variety of knowledge. data mining is one of the strongest knowledge management techniques that contributes to this matter. in other words, it is possible to create a system for discovering, extracting, storing and retrieving a variety of knowledge in value studies by using the concepts of data mining. this research tries to find methods for discovery, extraction, storage and retrieval of all kinds of repeatable knowledge of value studies that are known as the outcomes of value studies with the data mining approach and using its concepts and one of the most powerful tools of this technique i.e. neural networks.","value engineering, data mining, neural networks, value engineering","We attempt to design and use a systematic model for the management of value studies’ knowledge using data mining concepts. Using this systematic and purposeful model can remove the value studies from their traditional state and increase their efficiency either in terms of raising the value of each project or in terms of creating the ability to extract, record and retrieve the experts’ experience, skills and opinions as the team member of any value study. Accordingly, some effective results are as follows:  The most important result is meeting the main research problem i.e. “the lack of strategies to use the generated outcomes in previous value studies to use them in future applications”.  Contributing to implement value studies and increasing their efficiency: Using the results of this paper it is possible to overcome the difficulties and limitations mentioned above by using the outcomes of previous value studies that have a connection and overlap with the new project. Accordingly, in each of the mentioned phases the information and necessary elements of that phase are provided as a primary feed for the team members leading the effective use of time in a value study.  The transformation of tacit knowledge of experts and elites in multidisciplinary team (that provide this tacit and experimental knowledge in different phases of a value study) into applied and objective knowledge.  Expansion and development of value engineering for smaller projects where best specialists are absent it is possible to use their respective views and experiences.  Creating an intelligent system for organizations and ministries where the employers have large projects as well as the design consultant firms so that they can estimate the prior value studies that are relevant to their project based on the designed database.",alimeh mofidi naeini mba graduated mofidi_p@yahoo.com mohamad bozorgi industrial engineering graduated mohamadbozorgi@yahoo.com,

277,Developing A Comprehensive And Multi-Objective  Mathematical Model For University Course Timetabling,"in this paper, a multi-objective and comprehensive mathematical model is presented to address a course timetabling problem. the purpose of the model is to allocate the courses to timeslots, so that the following constraints are observed: availability times of instructors, the number of available classrooms in faculties, the eligibility of classes and timeslots for the courses, overlap prevention for teaching hours of each instructor, the maximum working times allocated to each instructor in day, overlap prevention for courses within course groups. also, this paper aims to increase satisfaction degree of instructors by maximizing their preferences to teach in their desired day and timeslot, as well as providing more times to do researches. the proposed model is coded in gams and solved by the augmented epsilon-constraint method for a real case study. finally, topsis method is employed in order to select the most favorable solution among the pareto solution. the results were approved and welcomed by the faculty.",timetabling,"and future work In this paper, a multi objective 0-1 programming model was presented. To make the model more real, different constraints were took into account in our study. These constraints were related to the availability and eligibility of instructors and classes, legal constraints, not overlapping the courses of instructors in a day, not overlapping the primary courses related to the students who enter the university in the same semester, and competency between the timeslots and the courses assigned them. The objectives were to maximize the preference level of instructors and minimize the working days of ones to teach. To evaluate the performance of the proposed model, a real case study was provided. The model was coded in GAMS software and solved by AECM for the case study. Then the TOPSIS method was used to select the most favorable solution among the non_d0minated solutions. For future research, considering other challenges (e.g. disruption and uncertainty) in designing the course timetable, and developing efficient meta-heuristics to address these challenges are suggested.","problem: a real case study amin jamili school of industrial engineering, college of engineering university of tehran, iran a_jamili@ut.ac.ir mahdi hamid school of industrial engineering, college of engineering university of tehran, iran m.hamid31400@ut.ac.ir hassan gharoun school of industrial engineering, college of engineering university of tehran, iran h.gharoun@ut.ac.ir roohollah khoshnoudi school of industrial engineering islamic azad university south tehran branch, tehran, iran st_r_khoshnoudi@azad.ac.ir","references.

279,Digital Human Modeling And Simulation To Correct Work  Postures In Dentistry,"the main objective of this paper is to design a dentists’ workspace for optimal performance using jack, developed by siemens corporation (siemens plm software inc.,) is a digital human modeling (dhm) software package capable of simulating human involved in any number of tasks and performing ergonomic analysis. dentists all over the world are suffering from musculoskeletal disorders (msds) that are resulted by improper work postures, repetitive tasks, and forced positions for longer time. thus, to reduce the effects of msds among dentists, ergonomic assessments have been implemented to evaluate their work postures and determine the risks at their workspaces. jack provides some design tools such as rapid upper limb assessment (rula) and ovako working analysis system (owas) for performing ergonomic analysis of virtual products and work environments. owas and rula are the ergonomic assessments that are used to examine the work postures and the msds for dentists resulted by the improper postures by simulating their postures on jack. by using the results of owas and rula, workspaces of the dentists are redesigned and their postural angles and positions are modified. the final analysis of owas and rula showed that improvements were significant to reduce msds while the dentists perform their tasks.","simulation, workspace analysis",,"danah ahmad, sarah hashem, kareem abbady, and suat kasap industrial engineering department college of engineering and technology american university of the middle east - aum egaila, kuwait suat.kasap@aum.edu.kw",
280,Developing A Conceptual Framework To Improve Healthcare  Quality Management In Oman,"purpose– worldwide, quality management (qm) in healthcare services has become an important focus. this paper aims to develop a conceptual framework that will be used to improve the existing qm in oman’s healthcare. design/methodology/approach– in may 2014, ministry of health in oman has published the first edition of its health vision: 2050. it was developed through a number of well-planned scientific activities. few studies have built on this vision in different aspects. this paper has studied this vision and other literatures that have been published in the last four years to design a framework for oman’s healthcare qm. findings– the proposed conceptual framework consists of four pillars; building a quality and patient safety culture among employees, top management commitments toward quality and patient safety, identifying a monitoring system to track input and output, and involving patients and their families in creating new services and improving the current ones. each pillar is consisting of different dimensions which are measured by key performance indicators. originality/value– to the best of author’s knowledge, no conceptual framework has been developed to improve oman’s healthcare qm. this framework assists decision makers to reach performance improvement against a best practice benchmark.","quality management, healthcare, muscat",,"yousuf nasser al khamisi medical and healthcare technology department, faculty of engineering and informatics, university of bradford, bradford, uk y.n.m.alkhamisi@bradford.ac.uk,",
281,Aligning The Maintenance Strategy With The Business  Context To Eliminate Hurdles In Translating The Business,"the alignment of the broad maintenance strategy with the overall business strategy brings in the strategic fit of maintenance activities with the overall business objectives. many times there is a misfit between the maintenance objectives and the business objectives, and this creates fissured priorities at the operational level, which mostly suffocates and derails the maintenance or reliability improvement initiatives in many businesses. the overall impact derived from the strategic misfit is not only limited to the viability of maintenance operations, but this is translated to the entire business, with oftentimes detrimental effects to the entire business’ performance. therefore, the strategic significance of maintenance activities need to be considered at business level, and be linked to the overall business strategy to eliminate any conflicting priorities in the operation of the business as a whole. this study was undertaken to examine the ways in which maintenance strategies are formulated and interlinked to the overall business context, and the means that can be established to eliminate any hurdles that may impede the strategic translation process.","alignment, strategic fit, pricing","The link between the business objectives as per the business balanced scorecard and the maintenance objectives as per the maintenance department’s balanced scorecard showed that in order to gain alignment of strategic intents, the functional objectives need to relate to the business objectives. This scenario removes the ambiguity of understanding the maintenance plans that need to be carried out in order to attain the business objectives. This further removes the hurdles in acquiring resources required by the maintenance function for them to meet their own objectives which are in alignment to the business objectives. The alignment of strategies and objectives removes the counterproductive debates and justification for maintenance expenditures in the absence of concrete plans. The budgetary processes also need to follow the strategic derivatives which are generated from the maintenance plan that is put in place with the objectivity to meet the business goals.","strategy peter muganyi department of engineering management university of johannesburg johannesburg, south africa peter777.muganyi@gmail.com charles mbohwa faculty of engineering and the built environment university of johannesburg johannesburg, south africa cmbohwa@uj.ac.za",
282,Thermography Monitoring And Diagnostic Tool In Predictive  Maintenance,"thermal transfer phenomena are ubiquitous in many industrial applications. a good knowledge of these processes makes it possible to ensure the conformity of the thermal equipments, to keep them in good working order, in order to increase the service life of these equipments and to improve their availability and their performances. thermography among the best monitoring and diagnostic tools used in predictive maintenance. the principle of this technique is to monitor through temperature sensors the thermal profile of structures and industrial systems. these sensors allow detecting abnormal temperature changes, indicating a potential malfunction: hotspot, leaks.... it measures the intensity of infrared (i.e. heat) emissions to determine the operating conditions of the equipment. by detecting thermal anomalies, some areas are warmer or colder than they should be, we can locate and identify incidents since their births. the use of thermography in a predictive maintenance program makes it possible, in particular, to control the thermal efficiency of processes based on transfers or heat preservation, the operation of electrical equipment and various parameters involved in both reliability and reliability system performance. infrared techniques can therefore be applied to many types of industrial equipment. the study of the thermal signature of a system or its components makes it possible to determine the heating zones which are often characteristic of the degradation of the system. the present work consists of giving the principle, advantages, disadvantages and application of thermography in industries.","thermal transfer, thermal equipment, thermography",,"amal boukili laboratory of industrial technology, faculty of sciences and technologies, sidi mohamed ben abdellah university, fez, morocco boukili.amal@gmail.com mohammed mesrar department signals, systems and components laboratory (lssc), faculty of sciences and technologies, sidi mohamed ben abdellah university, fez, morocco mesrar2012@gmail.com",
283,Multi-Objective Optimization Of Biomass Supply Chain  Networks,"food waste is a growing problem in our modern society. approximately one third of the food produced for human consumption is disposed. food losses and wastes occur along the entire food supply chain from harvesting to consumption. tackling the problem of food waste will lead to a more sustainable life. another problem facing our society is the drastic increase in energy consumption due to the continuous growth in the world population and the rise in standard of living. this increase stresses on the amount of fossil fuels being used to meet current demand, and eventually fossil fuel alone will not be able to meet the amount of energy needed by the world. this paper addresses the design of a food waste to bioethanol supply chain to tackle both problems of food wastes and energy. three key decisions are addressed for the optimal design of the supply chain: (1) the number, sizes and location of the bio-refineries; (2) the sites and amount of food wastes collected; (3) the transportation plans of bioethanol to demand points. a multi objective (economic, environmental, social) model is proposed. a case study in egypt is introduced and is proposed for future implementation.","biofuel, bioethanol, food waste, sustainable","and Future Work To conclude this work, a mixed integer linear programming mathematical model was constructed to help in the design of a potato waste biomass supply chain. To the best of our knowledge this paper is the first to address the design of a potato waste to ethanol supply chain. Also in this paper, the standard aggregate planning problem (which determines the production levels, inventory levels along the supply chain, hiring and laying off employees, backorders and demand satisfaction levels; while, maximizing the profit) is extended to include the environmental and social benefits with the purpose of incorporating sustainability. The future work intended is to apply this model to the case study mentioned in the previous section to determine the optimal design of the potato waste supply chain under deterministic assumptions. Then the model will be extended to address the uncertainties present in the supply chain, such as, supply, demand, and price of potato waste and ethanol, by incorporating different scenarios to the deterministic model, in order to mimic real life and reach the optimum sustainable objective. An economic objective that maximizes the total profit earned throughout the network. An environmental objective that aims at minimizing the total greenhouse gas emitted from the transportation of wastes, bioethanol and fuel blend, and from the production process. And finally two social objectives; one that maximizes the total number of jobs created, from the installation of the collection centers and bio-refineries, and their operation, and the other aims at minimizing the total amount of potato wastes uncollected from the supply sources in order to help improve the public health.

284,A Deep Long-Short-Term-Memory Neural Network For   Lithium-Ion Battery Prognostics,"with the increasing challenges in energy storage, the importance of lithium-ion batteries reliability cannot be understated. the prediction of the battery exact time of failure can provide a cost-efficient maintenance plan. in this paper, we propose a novel data-driven approach based on deep long-short-term-memory neural networks lstm for battery's remaining useful life (rul) estimation. the suggested method uses the past battery capacity, the time to discharge and the operating temperature to directly predict the rul. to validate the proposed model, we conduct experiments using the nasa lithium-ion battery dataset. the results show that our method produces exceptional performances for rul prediction under different loading and operating conditions.","prognostics, deep learning","In this work, we introduce an original deep neural network for lithium-ion battery prognostics based on LSTM layers. The proposed architecture demonstrates a clear performance advantage compared to the benchmark. Furthermore, the end-to-end nature eases the modelling process as no expert knowledge is involved. However, in online applications, the capacity is difficult to measure.Moreover, in risk-sensitive applications uncertainty estimation is essential. Future works must extract features from the discharge voltage and the current directly without using the capacity and must provide calibrated uncertainty estimations.

285,An Evaluation Of Road Hump Markings In Riyadh:  Detectability Of The Shapes And Colors,"although there are several shapes and colors of road hump markings used around the world, there is no unified international standard for road hump markings. road humps are causing a huge number of accidents and severe damage to cars in riyadh, saudi arabia. this paper evaluates road humps in riyadh in terms of detectability of road hump markings. the paper describes two experiments; the first experiment involves selecting the most three detectable shapes of road hump markings among six different shapes based on preferences of participants. the second experiment involves selecting the best combination of colors (white or yellow) for the selected road hump marking shapes based on response time. the result of the second experiment was that the yellow colored road hump showed a faster response time compared to the white colored one. regarding the shapes of road hump markings, the three shapes showed a similar response time as well as similar accuracies. these results suggest that color is a more important consideration than the type of shape when designing a road hump.","road hump, markings, detectability, riyadh","and Recommendations In conclusion, road hump marking color has a statistically significant effect on the response time, hence it should have an effect on the detectability of road humps. The white color has a slower response time than the yellow color, so the white color shouldn’t be used for road hump markings. On the other hand, the yellow color is more detectable than the white color based on the response time. The road hump marking shape and the interaction between the shape and color do not have any statistically significant effect on the response time. Shape 6 (which consists of several bars) has the fastest mean response time compared to the other shapes of road hump markings. Moreover, the bar shapes are easy to install and maintain which will save a lot of time and cost. The recommended design (shape and color) of road hump marking is shape 6 with a yellow color. Shape 6 consists of several bars, where each bar has a width of 30 cm and a length extending to the edge of the road hump. The distance between each two bars should be 40 cm. Moreover, we recommend that this paper be the base for more investigation regarding the road hump markings especially for the colors of road hump markings. In addition, we recommend that the white color should be no longer be used for road hump markings.","ahmed m. el-sherbeeny industrial engineering department king saud university riyadh, 11421, ksa aelsherbeeny@ksu.edu.sa woo-hyung park industrial engineering department king saud university riyadh, 11421, ksa wpark@ksu.edu.sa mohammed a. alghufaili industrial engineering department king saud university riyadh, 11421, ksa m.m.m_10@hotmail.com abdulrahman i. al-husseini industrial engineering department king saud university riyadh, 11421, ksa doo7.93@gmail.com",

Maintenance logistics targets to optimize the maintenance system by rationalization of the human, material, financial and informational resources linked with the actions of maintenance and monitoring the operations of the physical assets by applying specified implements and exploration of data provided by them (Nour , 2017:130). Flexibility is recommended with regards to maintenance logistical organizational choice centered on assessed cost- effectiveness and the maintenance system strategic intents. Other relatable structural situations like legislative controls, skills matrix, training availability, skilled manpower, machine spares suppliers proximity, contractor skills and availability, need to be assessed before the final strategic maintenance logistics organization is derived. Amalgamation of organizational types is tenable, and this holds as long as the strategic intents are satisfied, and high physical assets reliability and availability are maintained. A strategic approach need to be arrayed to assess organizational efficacy and relevance to the maintenance logistics factors in full consideration of all input attributes like manpower, skill-sets, machine spares and maintenance information control. The maintenance logistical structure need to be reviewed continuously and in light of changing operational dynamics.","peter muganyi department of engineering management university of johannesburg johannesburg, south africa peter777.muganyi@gmail.com charles mbohwa faculty of engineering and the built environment university of johannesburg johannesburg, south africa cmbohwa@uj.ac.za",
294,Why Lean Six Sigma Implementation Is Still So Limited In  Higher Education?,"lean six sigma is a powerful business initiative that improves the effectiveness and performance of organizations. it started as a useful improvement strategy in manufacturing and then was transferred to other sectors. although popular in many industries, its implementation in higher education is still limited and to date has not yet achieved its potential as a tool that enhances the effectiveness and efficiency of institutions which operate in highly competitive environments with pressure respond to their stakeholders’ expectations and to attract more students and funds. academic institutions seem to resist the implementation of lean six sigma despite its widespread success in achieving processes improvement and minimizing variations and defects. therefore, it would be important to shed light on the challenges hindering its implementation. some of these obstacles might originate from the nature of higher education and others from the approach’s concept or misunderstanding perceptions. this research aims to identify the main obstacles of six sigma in higher education with hope to create more awareness regarding these challenges for those seeking to implement six sigma in higher education. it is hoped that this research will support future research that aim to enable a better fit of lean six sigma with higher education.",,,"abdullah al-amri department of design, manufacture and engineering management, university of strathclyde, uk (email;abdullah.al-amri@strath.ac.uk)",
295,A System Dynamics Model For Policy Evaluation Of Energy  Dependency,"iran’s energy supply system is highly dependent on fossil fuels due to excessive cheap fuel consumption used in transportation and power generation, as well as the lack of fuel economy standards for the appropriate amount of consumption. in addition, import of fuel derivatives such as gasoline makes fossil fuel usage a path-dependent process. such increasing energy demand which has led to high energy intensity, is a serious threat to iran’s energy security. understanding the systematic structure of this dependency is the main interest of this study. system dynamics approach is applied to model energy dependency and test four different scenarios. comparison of the results infers that there will be increasing energy dependence on fossil fuels. in an increasing fossil fuel supply scenario, the energy dependency index decreases and on the other hand, the energy security weakens due to the excessive consumption of fossil fuels resources. nevertheless, if the energy supply increases via consumption of renewable energy resources, as in the second scenario, the energy dependency index decreases while there are no significant changes in the energy security index. in the last scenario, the demand-side management and energy demand reduction gained attraction in order to reduce the energy dependency index. however, this policy should be accompanied by increasing the renewable energy capacities to be able to reduce the energy efficiency and increase the energy security.","energy dependency, energy security, renewable energy","From the comparison of the four scenarios tested on the model, it could be said that by continuing the current state, dependence on energy would increase. By implementing the second scenario and increasing the supply of energy through fossil fuels, the energy dependency index decreases due to increased supply, but considering the more intense fossil fuel reduction, the country's energy security will be weakened. In the third scenario, by increasing supply via renewable energies, the rate of energy dependency index decreases and the energy security index does not change. Finally, in the last scenario, with demand-side management and energy demand reduction, the energy dependency index would decrease, and this rate is higher than renewable energy capacity development, and in terms of energy dependency index, it is a more efficient policy, but given that the majority of energy supply in this scenario is also achieved through fossil fuels and their resources are coming to an end, this policy does not have a long-term sustainability and it is recommended that the demand- side management policy and the development of renewable energy capacities be implemented simultaneously in order to decrease energy dependency and increase energy security. 3113","mahdi bastan school of industrial engineering, college of engineering university of tehran tehran, iran bastan@ut.ac.ir hamed shakouri g. school of industrial engineering, college of engineering university of tehran tehran, iran hshakouri@ut.ac.ir","References

296,Proactive Maintenance Strategic Application To Advance  Equipment Reliability,"proactive maintenance is one highly effective but overshadowed generic maintenance strategy, which when effectively implemented, is significant in improving equipment reliability. proactive maintenance aims to eliminate, reduce, automate or simplify maintenance without compromising reliability or safety. proactive maintenance concerns empowering individuals to solve problems and in its simplest form, it encompasses three core concepts: maintenance elimination, maintenance prevention and maintenance improvement. proactive maintenance involves moving beyond standard task lists and reactive repairs to an analysis about why a component failed in the first place. it may mean finding a process, product, or procedure that extends the life of a component and requires less frequent inspections. it can be as simple as standardizing screws, improving access to hard-to-reach inspection points, or showing internal customers how to fill out a work order correctly. this study was carried out to unveil the aspects of proactive maintenance that makes it superior to other generic maintenance strategies which have been popularized over the years at its expense.",reliability,"The literature research is explicit about the benefits derived from the application of the proactive maintenance strategy and its superiority with regards to equipment failure elimination, asset reliability improvement and lessening overall maintenance costs. However, like any other strategy, any lack of a structured approach to implementing proactive maintenance will result in no reliability performance improvement realized, and a failure to reap any benefits allied to proactive maintenance. The benefits derived from the application of proactive maintenance strategy include the following:  Optimization of the overall performance of the plant manufacturing assets  Increased useful life of physical assets  Freeing up the maintenance function to concentrate on value adding activities rather than on reactive maintenance  Reduction of the maintenance cost structure  Improved Equipment performance, resources utilization, environmental & safety performance.  Sustainable maintenance policy deployment Further research efforts need to be focused on approaches for effectively implementing proactive maintenance strategy in various business set-ups.","peter muganyi department of engineering management university of johannesburg johannesburg, south africa peter777.muganyi@gmail.com charles mbohwa faculty of engineering and the built environment university of johannesburg johannesburg, south africa cmbohwa@uj.ac.za",

298,A Simulation Study Of Sustainable Agri-Food Supply Chain,"agri-food supply chain (asc) topic has attracted a lot of academics and practitioners in the last decade due to the globally increasing concern of public health and food safety and quality. fresh produce has special characteristics, which includes perishability, uncertainty of supply and demand, and carbon dioxide equivalent emissions produced throughout the supply chain due to cooling, transportation, and disposal of fresh produce. these factors impose an additional complexity while managing this type of supply chains. this work concentrates on developing a simulation model of a two-echelon real life supply chain. the objective is to study the effect of changing order quantity under uncertain demand and lead time on a set of economic, social and environmental performance measures. although, in a business environment economic dimension continues to be a top priority, simulation results showed that there is no contradiction between all three dimensions of sustainability. it minimized food wastage, offering higher quality fresh produce, lower emissions; while maintaining highest profit and an acceptable service level.",perishable good,"This work studied the management of inventory in a sustainable agri-food supply chain with stochastic demand and lead time. It also introduced a real-life case based on data from Company X, which was used to drive a discrete event simulation model and to study the effect of changing the order size on the selected performance measures addressing economic, environmental and social pillars of sustainability. Simulation was used as mathematical models sometimes fail to handle the complexity of real-life situations and due to stochastic nature of the data mentioned. Also due to its ability to replicate and analyse the performance of the real system, as well as suggesting alternatives to improve the overall system efficiency. The suggested inventory model represents a pull system, in which supply depends on demand; it is different from the currently push supply chain model adopted by Company X. The model also considers some of the important features of ASC: product limited life time, product quality, in addition to the stochastic nature of the demand and lead time. Three sources of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions were considered; transportation, cooling, and disposal emissions. The model has been run for different order quantities and the selected performance measures have been investigated. Based on the results analysis, it was concluded that using a (𝛾) value of 51% could help in improving overall sustainability of the system when compared with current management practices. Thus, setting adequate order quantity has a considerable effect on the various supply chain performance measures. It was proved that varying order quantities by, as small as, 15% could double food wastage. Furthermore, it may also be concluded that there is no contradiction among the different pillars of sustainability as the present study succeeded in generating a solution which satisfies economic, environmental and social aspects. Areas to be considered for future research include the study of effect of different transportation modes, whether water, truck, air or multimodal on the sustainability of the supply chain. Furthermore, the effect of different water transportation types whether container shipment or reefer shipment on performance may be investigated.

299,Starbucks Coffee Statistical Analysis  Anna Wu,"the purpose of this stem project is to determine which starbucks drinks among all coffee and tea options are best for cardiovascular disease (cvd) prevention. in order to do this, a health index was constructed considering different variables, including: saturated fat, cholesterol, sodium, carbohydrates, dietary fiber, sugars, protein, and caffeine. each variable was assigned a weighting coefficient, with lower coefficients assigned to the factors that are more harmful and higher ones to those that are more beneficial. therefore, drinks with the highest health index are determined to be the most beneficial to preventing cvd. principal components analysis (pca) was used to explore all factors in the analysis and to inform on the utility of the health index in relation to its link to cvd prevention. pca was successfully able to decompose the dominant sources of variability in relation to the health index, where 66.4% and 12.6% of variation were attributable to principal components 1 (prin 1) and 2 (prin 2), respectively. therefore, 79% of the total variation was explained on the basis of the first two principal components. prin 1 did a good job grouping the data, separating frappuccino blended and espresso beverages in one cluster, and mainly cold brew, freshly brewed, and tea in another. prin 2 largely grouped data based on cholesterol and fat content, and held less explanatory power than principal component 1. the health index originally derived on the basis of the scientific research, largely corroborated the results of pca 1 vs. drink/ drink category. hierarchical clustering was used to form 3 clusters across drink categories, and results were taken together with the health index/ pca to investigate which combined set of factors contributed most to cvd prevention. this project sheds light on smarter ordering at starbucks, making people more aware of how diet ultimately affects health and more specifically, how smart drink choices can promote cvd prevention.","stem, starbucks coffee","Overall, the results of all three analyses corroborate one other and point to the following drink categories at Starbucks as the best choices for heart disease prevention: Cold & Ice Brewed Coffees, Freshly Brewed Coffees, and Starbucks Refreshers and Teas. Espressos are also a good choice only if they are lower in sugar, cholesterol, etc. Next steps for research include a more granular assessment by specific drinks within each category, and a more precisely weighted (in terms of relative magnitude and mathematical structure of the coefficients) health index model. Also, we can plan to include additional factors in the analysis which science has suggested are correlated with heart disease prevention, such as antioxidants, flavonoids, and other substances present in coffee beverages.

302,"Bi-Level Programming Model For Combining Motivation,  Opportunity And Ability Factors In Knowledge Sharing","motivation, opportunity, and ability (moa) are three factors that influence employees’ performance and have been accepted widely in the literature, but there is no agreement on the interactions between these three factors in shaping the performance. therefore, proposing a model for connecting these factors to performance is interesting. all of the previous models are designed based on the regression analysis. this paper aims to apply mathematical programming in this issue for the first time. knowledge sharing as a proper area and bi-level programming as an extendable framework selected for developing such a model. we implemented our model in general algebraic modeling system (gams) with randomly generated data for 100 employees. outputs of optimization model analyzed by spss regression analysis. based on the results obtained in the statistical analysis, predicted performance by the proposed bi-level programming model has a behavior close to the results reported by the previous empirical research. future research can test the proposed model using empirical data in comparison to currently available regression models.","moa framework, knowledge sharing, opportunity","MOA framework is an accepted but challenging model for explaining the performance of employees. Several competing models exist in the literature for defining the inter-relationships between three popular drivers of performance. All of these models are designed based on regression. This research proposes a novel mathematical model based on the bi-level programming for predicting the performance of employee’s based on MOA framework in the context of knowledge sharing. After developing the bi-level programming model, random data used to compare the predicted performance by the proposed model in three various regression models. Results showed that the generated data by the proposed model has a behavior close to those reported in the empirical research by Siemsen et al. (2008). Therefore, this model could explain the reality with more precision according to its flexibility in parameters. However, it should be tested by empirical research before proposing arguments. So, one direction of future research is testing the proposed model with empirical data for various setting parameters. Another limitation of this research is some assumptions regarding the formulation and parameters that should be examined and compared in different situations. So, analyzing various structures in the model both analytically and numerically could be interesting. By approving the benefits of bi-level programming in predicting the behavior of employees, future research can focus on extending the model to multiple behaviors such as including tacit knowledge sharing decision in addition to explicit knowledge sharing decision, and also, on including managerial decisions in the upper-level problem to develop a decision support system.","mohsen tabatabaei, abbas afrazeh and abbas seifi department of industrial engineering and management systems amirkabir university of technology tehran, iran tabatabaie@aut.ac.ir, afrazeh@aut.ac.ir, aseifi@aut.ac.ir",

304,New Framework To Optimise Leagile Supply Chain Design  Thi Hong Dang Nguyen And Thien-My Dao,"the paper presents the new quantitative framework to optimise leagile supply chain (lasc) design. the first step utilises lean tools to identify the optimal architecture for product families through the so- called leagile bills-of-material in product design. this step intends to reduce the storage keeping unit of the component set (lean), while increasing the ability of combining them to create new products (agile). meantime, the second stage focuses on outlining the preliminary configuration of lasc with pre-defined decoupling and risk-pooling points. from then, the product architecture is matched with a supplier network before the supply side is refined. afterwards, step four implements lean philosophy to leanize the upstream site up to decoupling point. finally, lasc's cost structure, which comprises from two different product types, is analysed. based on minimising the total cost at a certain service level, the best configuration of lasc is optimised.the whole framework is illustrated in one specific case study.",decoupling point,"This article presents a new framework to optimise the design of LASC. Opposite to the idea from (Christopher and Towill (2001)), findings from this research show that Lean strategy can be a very good foundation for LASC development. The key factor for that success lies at generating the conformation between product family design and LASC design. This framework has fulfilled two research gaps identified before by taking into account the design of the product architecture into a LASC quantitative design. The article also presented the new concept of LA BOM and the procedure to create it. It may be very useful for designers in reality. However, there are some other obstacles that need careful attention when designing and pursuing LA SC: - The problem of quality homogeneity of products from different suppliers - The problem of optimising assembly stations for dynamic schedule - Optimal inventory levels at decoupling points. - The necessary of flexible transportation system to support the logistics postponement - The problem of enhancing the forecasting ability - The information of customer demand must be updated continuously to timely reflect the quantity of agile inventory at the decoupling point. There are still plenty of rooms for future studies in this field. For instance, scholars could conduct their research on LA SCD for multi-families product or on designing LASC, while considering reliability and resilience in the risk environment. Researchers also would try to use multi-decoupling points to amplify the agility of LASC.","department of mechanical/ manufacturing engineering école de technologie supérieure, l’université du québec 1100 rue notre dame ouest, montréal, qc, canada thi-hong-dang.nguyen.1@ens.etsmtl.ca, thien-my.dao@etsmtl.ca",
305,A New Formulation Of Capacitated Plant Location Problem  Rrk Sharma And Ajay Jha,"the capacitated plant location problem (cplp) is a very well studied problem in literature. in this paper we give a new formulation of the same. we first give an intuitive justification for the addition of new constraints. we consider the extreme case when transportation costs are very high, compared to location cost then in that situation we will tend to locate many plants that will reduce the transportation costs. and on other hand, when transportation costs are very low compared to location cost, then may locate very few plants. we introduce a new formulation of cplp that addresses the above mentioned situations. key words: cplp, splp, new formulation. 1. problem description plant/ facility location is a key decision in supply chain network planning and a well studied problem in literature, where its variations are brought by considering the capacity of the plant to be located as un-capacitated/ capacitated in nature thus to fulfill the demands originated at market points. the installed capacity of a production unit is often constrained by various factors like land and construction cost, labor cost, raw material availability and other regulations applicable at that location. the monthly fixed costs (location costs) of the different locations and also the transportation costs have to be well estimated by the cross functional team comprising of finance, production and supply chain personnel. these problems are referred to as simple plant location problem (splp) and capacitated plant location problem (cplp) in literature for which a variety of heuristic based approaches and exact solution methodology are available. 2. problem formulation the important strategic decision in plant location problem is to set up the plants that minimize total cost (location plus transportation). traditional capacitated facility location and transportation problem formulation is given below. the set of notations used in the models are: i: denotes the set of possible sites where the plants can be located. i: represents the element belonging to set i. fi: represents the fixed cost of installing a plant at the location i. si: represents the production capacity of the plant at the location i. k: denotes the set of existing markets to be served. 2326",,,"dept of industrial and management engineering indian institute of technology, kanpur - 208016, india rrks@iitk.ac.in, ajjha@iitk.ac.in","References

307,Inventory Control Policies In The Humanitarian Supply Chain  Using System Dynamics Modeling,"in the humanitarian relief operations due to the damaged infrastructure the flow of relief inventories usually experiences delay. for instance roads are often damaged or jammed, and the information about demand and inventory are usually disturbed or unable to be obtained. such circumstance imposes a considerable amount of uncertainty on the demand and supply side in the disaster relief chain. delays hinder the optimal and timely provision of aid to the beneficiaries. the mechanism of how such delays influence the flow of material and information in the humanitarian supply chain is less studied. in this research we focus on post-disaster inventory management. we consider inventory ordering decisions which are decisions related to the post-disaster/warning stage once some information about a disaster become available. in this study we aim to understand the effect of delays on the various inventory control policies and investigate effective strategies that help to reduce the impact of delays in the disaster relief operations. we use system dynamics modeling to present a two echelon disaster supply chain model consisting of a downstream and upstream agent under a dynamic transport/lead time delay.",system dynamics,,"ali anjomshoae department of manufacturing and industrial engineering, faculty of mechanical engineering, universiti teknologi malaysia, skudai, malaysia aali5@live.utm.my adnan hassan department of manufacturing and industrial engineering, faculty of mechanical engineering, universiti teknologi malaysia, skudai, malaysia adnan@mail.fkm.utm.my kuan yew wong department of manufacturing and industrial engineering, faculty of mechanical engineering, universiti teknologi malaysia, skudai, malaysia wongky@fkm.utm.my",
308,Towards A Reliable Decision Making On Safety Barriers  Performance Based On Expert Judgments In The Framework,"bora (barrier and operational risk analysis) is relatively new approach developed for qualitative and quantitative risk and safety barriers analysis. it includes a barrier block diagrams, fault trees (ft), and risk influence diagrams combined for analyzing accident scenarios that may occur on oil and gas industries and assessing safety barriers performance. this recent approach has been chosen because of its analysis of operational factors (human, technical and organizational factors) that contributed in these accidents. furthermore, a close attention that is given to safety barriers analysis. in fact, it allows analyzing the major accident scenarios and the performance of all safety barriers existing and opposing the occurrence of these scenarios. for this reason, the qualitative and quantitative analysis using barrier block diagrams and fault tree analysis (fta) are applied, followed by influence diagram analysis, the effects of risk influencing factors (rifs) on the initiating and basic events in the fault trees. in the context of bora, expert judgment plays an important role in quantifying the revised probabilities of failure on demand of safety barriers considering average probabilities of failure on demand pave (e) by aggregating weights (wi) and scores (qi) for each rif. when the judgments of multiple experts are elicited, mathematical aggregation methods can then be used to combine these individual judgments into a single judgment for calculating the pfdrev. using these methods, the risk analysts are able to combine these judgments in order to make better evaluation/decision about performance of safety barriers on terms of reliability, availability, effectiveness, response time and confidence level...etc. as known, three categories of aggregation methods are evoked by researchers and scientists and carried out in different fields. namely, conjunctive methods, compromise methods and disjunctive methods. notes that, each method is selected taking into account the nature of opinions and data dissemination given by experts. these methods will be introduced and compared through following sections. in the extant literature, many works were developed in the context bora approach. a whole series of papers were submitted by skelt et al, where they have proposed this approach then applied it as ""bora- release"" which was intended for qualitative and quantitative risk analysis of hydrocarbon releases to prevent releases on offshore oil and gas production platforms. in these papers, the expert judgment is made using one expert who is considered as reliable while it is not sufficient to account on one expert to judge these situations. 2332",,,"of bora approach mouloud bourareche, zakarya chiremsel, rachid nait-said, nouara ouazraoui laboratory of research in industrial prevention (lrip) health and occupational safety institute. university of batna 2. road of constantine n°53. fesdis. batna, 05078, algeria. mouloud.bourareche@hotmail.fr zoko88@gmail.com, r_nait_said@hotmail.com, ouzraoui@yahoo.fr",

311,"Managing Local Communities In Large Projects, Appraial Of  Two Complex Projects In Iran","large projects are designed to change the shape of society by bringing economic values for a wide range of stakeholders. they are however, prone to influence cultural and societal values of society and therefore, project organizations need to have a better understanding of demands and values of the society in which the project is deployed. considering local communities, this research tries to deduct a theory for perceptions of local communities from activities and behavior of project organization. the method of this research is case study and it uses documents from companies as well as interviews from three groups of stakeholders: project organization, local communities and local government. the role of local government is considered as the communicator standing between local communities and project organizations. the results of this research show that transparency, social and environmental sustainability and the organization background highly influences local community’s perception of the behavior of project organization activities. this research makes contributions to theory, by building the model from the local community’s view point and to practice, by giving a more clear view of the benefits of communications with local communities.","local community, transparency, sustainability","Local communities are being influenced by complex projects while the majority of their perceptions about the changes brought to their life is influenced by project organization’s behavior. Consequently, these perceptions can be mediated and controlled by selection of proper governance mechanism, transparency, being socially, environmentally and economically sustainable. Additionally, the results of this qualitative theory building research revealed that activities and behaviors of project organization can make a history profile for them which can influence their legitimacy and reputation in long term. Decision makers of organizations should be aware that they can influence stakeholders’ perceptions by the management style they adopt and academics are suggested to have a shift from focusing on project organization’s view point to stakeholder’s. There was a model built in this research with case study method, in Iran and within Oil & Gas sector.

312,"Moroccan Electronic Health Record System  Houssam Benbrahim, Hanaâ Hachimi And Aouatif Amine","the subject of big data has been studied more and more in all areas, particularly in the health services sector. big data technology can eventually change the medical practice by setting up very advanced tools to store, manage, analyze and secure the information collected at a very high level. the goal is to use this data from various sources to improve the management and effectiveness of care, also to monitor the health status of the population. in morocco, the health field is one of the most important concerns of the government. access to health data in morocco is very limited, and in another side this sector encounters several problems in the digital management of these data. for all these reasons, we must think of creative and innovative solutions. transforming clinical data into knowledge to improve patient care has been the goal of this article, for which we propose a new model called the moroccan electronic health record system. this last will be common between all health services in morocco such as hospitals, clinics and medical offices. the system will be national and based on the context of big data in order to improve and develop the health sector in morocco.","big data, healthcare","To conclude, the Moroccan Electronic Health Record System article is a new proposed national system for the health sector in Morocco. This project will be developed on the power of Big Data technologies, using well-defined and well-chosen storage, management, and analysis tools and platforms. The goal is to create a common platform for all providers, pharmacies, hospitals, clinics, doctors, etc., to share patient information, maintain medical traceability of health services, ensure effective analysis, and more things. The Moroccan patient should be placed at the center of this national system and their medical data must be secured, controlled and supervised. In order to deploy this system in Morocco, several steps have been proposed, and the most important point is to sensitize Moroccan citizens for encouraging them to participate in the collection of personal medical information. The MEHR system is a platform which will facilitate the analysis of patient data, help improve the quality of health services, and provide a powerful work environment.

313,Designing Of New Attribute Control Chart With Multiple  Dependent State Sampling Using A Cost Model Based On,"the np control chart is used to monitor the number of nonconforming items in a sample. a new np control chart was introduced recently by utilizing the information on the past subgroups via the idea of multiple dependent state sampling. unlike traditional control charts, this chart is known with two pairs of control limits. this paper proposes an economic model with statistical constraints based on lorenzen & vance cost function in order to determine best design parameters of the new np chart. moreover, the model is extended under linear, quadratic, exponential, and inverted normal loss functions. accordingly, the same magnitude of deviations from the target results in different quality costs. a solution procedure is presented for optimally specification of five design parameters. based on numerical studies, the algorithm procedure is illustrated and some comparisons are made to evaluate the performances of economic design (ed) versus economic-statistical design (esd). the sensitivity of the optimal cost and the chart parameters for different loss functions and input parameters is investigated. the results have indication of significant improvement in statistical performance for esd despite a small increase in cost due to the statistical constraints added to ed.","np control chart, multiple dependent, state sampling",,"loss functions muhammad aslam department of statistics, faculty of science king abdulaziz university jeddah, saudi arabia aslam_ravian@hotmailcom mohammad saber fallah nezhad and samrad jafarian-namin industrial engineering department, faculty of engineering yazd university yazd, iran fallahnezhad@yazd.ac.ir, samrad.jafarian@stu.yazd.ac.ir",
314,Packagecargo Open Source Tool Based On  Optimization And Simulation For The Container Loading,"traditional considerations related to dynamic stability constraint in the container loading problem (clp), such as boxes with insufficient lateral support, have proven to be inaccurate when compared with the results of dynamic simulations where the boxes are subjected to real world conditions. in response to this, two indicators for dynamic stability were introduced; the number of fallen boxes and the number of boxes likely to be damaged in case of acceleration. these indicators, however, have not yet been estimated using a mechanical approach. an open source application (packagecargo) was developed to calculate, visualize, and save efficient packing patterns to instances of the clp, and has been enhanced with a dynamic simulation environment to obtain performance indicators related the dynamic stability of such patterns. the physics engine used in the application is capable of trading accuracy for simulation speed and is in most cases non-deterministic. through packagecargo we evaluated the accuracy of new dynamic stability metrics. a mechanical model that measures dynamic stability without the need to subject the packing pattern to a physics simulation was developed, based on a dynamic analysis of the forces and accelerations acting upon the boxes and using the kinetic parameters of the load such as mass distribution, coefficient of friction, and rigidity.",2002),"PhysX is accurate according to the performed benchmark test. Additionally, the results show acceptable repeatability for the dynamic simulations, allowing it to be taken as an accurate baseline for comparison with the mathematical model. PhysX produces results for M3 and M4 with satisfactory accuracy. This is of significance, since PhysX produces such results in a short amount of time, without presenting any variance in its results. This makes it attractive for integration with an optimization algorithm considering the dynamic stability constraint. The open source nature of PackageCargo makes the software readily accessible for contributions seeking to enhance its capabilities beyond the scope of this work (i.e. simulating marine and air transportation). It also makes the offered optimization and simulation tools available to the scientific and academic communities to allow the evaluation of simulation models and optimization algorithms. 2369","problem with dynamic stability juan c. martínez, daniel cuellar, edgar céspedes and david álvarez-martínez department of industrial engineering school of engineering universidad de los andes bogotá d.c., colombia d.alvarezm@uniandes.edu.co","References

(a) descriptive analytics: the purpose of this type of analysis is to find out ‘what is happening in a business entity’. common examples of descriptive analytics are company reports that simply provide a historic review of an organization’s operations, sales, financials, customers, and stakeholders. respondents to apqc’s survey indicate that descriptive analytics is the most commonly used form across all areas of supply chain, including quality management, procurement, process management, logistics, supply chain planning and manufacturing. (b) diagnostic analytics: the purpose of this type of analysis is to find out ‘why something is happening’ or ‘why something has happened in the past’. it is characterized by techniques such as drill-down, data discovery, data mining and correlations. it starts at the beginning of descriptive analytics and extends to predictive analytics.. usually, the outcome of this analytics is a dashboard. (c) predictive analytics: the purpose of this type of analysis is to give a probabilistic estimate of ‘what will happen’ if the things keep happening in the same way. the goal is to go beyond knowing what has happened to providing a best assessment of what will happen in the future. predictive analytics brings together advanced analytics capabilities spanning ad-hoc statistical analysis, predictive modeling, data mining, text analytics, optimization, real-time scoring and machine learning. these tools help organizations discover patterns in data and go beyond knowing what has happened to anticipating what is likely to happen next. (d) prescriptive analytics- the purpose of this type of analysis is to find out ‘what should be done’. prescriptive analytics can also suggest decision options for how to take advantage of a future opportunity or mitigate a future risk, and illustrate the implications of each decision option. in practice, prescriptive analytics can proceedings of the international conference on industrial engineering and operations management paris, france, july 26-27, 2018 © ieom society international 3322",,"In this paper we gave interesting hypotheses relating analytics, strategy, culture and personality.

316,The Impact Of Employee Motivation On Productivity At A  Water Treatment And Supply’S Laboratory In,"the aim of this research is to identify factors promoting motivation and to ultimately improve productivity levels in the laboratories of a water treatment and supply company in johannesburg, south africa. a review of the literature spanning for a period of 10 years was performed to determine the causes of motivation and demotivation from well-known theories. two theories, closely investigated in the laboratory, were the mcgregor y theory, maslow hierarchy. the researchers attempted to investigate what causes chemistry staff to be demotivated and perform poorly in the laboratory although there was an on-going continuous improvement drive based on lean thinking. this was achieved through a quantitative study by interpreting the data gathered during survey questioning with the laboratory staff. the sample chosen was based on a quota sampling selection. results obtained from the analysis of data gathered through the questionnaires provide a clear indication of where the company’s drive for continuous improvement is and where it should be. the research was successful in showing the influence of motivational factors on productivity in the laboratory and recognizing any techniques to improve motivation amongst chemistry staff.",employee motivation,"The results found from the ANOVA showed that formulated hypothesis would not be rejected with the second, third, fourth questions giving critical values of 2.28, 3.51, 2.08 respectively against the critical value of 4.03. The first questions answer from the ANOVA (Table 6) gave a result which wouldn't reject the tested hypothesis. From this the researcher can conclude that Working conditions of the laboratory, the trust from management given to employee's opinions and ideas, and Promotions (opportunities) and rewards do affect and have an impact on the productivity of the laboratory. The theories used in this study are evident that their importance is significant for a laboratory to obtain increased levels of productivity, absenteeism, and lower turnover rates. The findings of this study indicate that there is a correlation that exists between motivation factors and productivity. The research successfully showed the influence of Communication between the superiors and subordinates, working conditions, trust, and promotions and rewards greatly impact the productivity of the laboratory and hence Maslow suggestion that management needs to satisfy the higher-level factors first for them to ensure that their employees stay satisfied with their current jobs and the productivity of the lab is not affected. It can be seen from the results that the more years of service the employees had influenced their response to the questionnaire and that the older employees were more mature to the questions. They have had a lot of experience in avoiding or resolving and coping with the factors which affected their motivation towards the type of work they performed. Management need to incorporate motivational techniques in the laboratory which can assist them to motivate their employees so that their laboratory productivity levels aren't affected. 6. Recommendations and the Way Forward Future studies should focus on the effectiveness of motivators being applied from the perspective of the laboratory staff. Management can employ the following strategies to motivate their employees using salaries, wages, and conditions of service to improve their employee's morale, as well as to ensure that employees are developed through training and being awarded opportunities within the organization. Another way managers can stimulate motivation is by ensuring that information is available to the employees, transparency in the department helps subordinates compete with each other fairly. A study conducted by Brown and Sheppard (1997) examined the characteristics of the work of teacher in a four category being, knowledge based, technical skills, values, and beliefs. He reported that they will succeed in meeting the challenge only if they are motivated by deeply-held values and beliefs regarding the development of a shared vision. Colvin (1998) noted that he believed that financial incentives increase productivity. Additionally, Nzuve (1999) stressed that it is important that managers practice general supervision rather than close detailed supervision of employees so that managers devote their time on supervisory activities, rather than close detailed special tasks. 2380","johannesburg, south africa sambil mukwakungu, jwalane elizabeth mpharoane, charles mbohwa department of quality and operations management university of johannesburg sambilm@uj.ac.za, jwalanempharoane@gmail.com, cmbohwa@uj.ac.za","References

320,Development Of Approximation Algorithms For Minimizing  The Average Flowtime And Maximum Earliness With Zero,"this paper considers the bicriteria scheduling problem of minimizing the average flowtime and maximum earliness on a single machine with zero release dates. the problem is np hard, though the minimum slack time (mst) and shortest processing time (spt) rules yield optimal solutions for the maximum earliness (emax) and average flowtime (favg) problems, respectively if each criterion were to be applied singly. thus, in evaluating two proposed heuristics (sae and eao), the values of each of the criteria for the two proposed heuristics were compared against the optimal solution of the sub problems. computational experimental results with job sizes varying from 5 to 200 jobs show that sae is not significantly different from the optimal favg. the results also show that for problem sizes, 5 n 30, sae is not significantly different from the optimal emax. however, the results of eao heuristic is significantly different from the optimal for the two criteria except for favg for problem sizes, 40 n 200. therefore, the sae heuristic is recommended for simultaneously minimizing average flowtime and maximum earliness on a single machine with zero release dates.","average flowtime, maximum earliness, optimal, heuristics, bicriteria 2405","and Recommendation This paper proposed two direct heuristics for minimizing the average flowtime and maximum earliness on a single machine with zero release dates. Results of the simulation in terms of effectiveness shows that the SAE heuristic yielded results that are not significantly different from the optimal solution (SPT) for the average flowtime for all the considered problem sizes (5 n 200). Also for problem sizes, 5 n 30, the SAE heuristic is not significantly different from the optimal (obtained from the MST heuristic) for maximum earliness. Thus, the SAE heuristic is recommended for simultaneously minimizing average flowtime and maximum earliness on a single machine with zero release date especially for job sizes not greater than 30.","release dates saheed akande department of mechanical and mechatronics engineering, afe babalola university, ado-ekiti nigeria ayodeji. e. oluleye department of industrial and production engineering university of ibadan, ibadan, nigeria e.o. oyetunji department of mechanical engineering lagos state university, lagos, nigeria",
321,Relative Bibliometrics Of Intellectual Capital And Knowledge  Management In Scopus,"the purpose of this work is a bibliometric analysis of the evolution of knowledge management (km) and intellectual capital (ic) as scientific fields in time. the used data was all articles having “intellectual capital” or “knowledge management” in their title from scopus database exported in excel and r language is used to compute the indexes. the analysis is using the indexes (h index, n index, g index, i index, lotka’s law), which are most related to references and citations of the articles. we find that km and ic fields are heterogeneous in cases and homogeneous in other cases vis à vis the applied indexes. this analysis is usefull to researchers in the two areas to find the pionners and the most productive authors to potentially collaborate with them and, the most read articles to use them in literature review. in databases of researches, only h index is offered but to all articles of area defined by the database and not for a set of requested articles. this paper is filling this gap, as the first study of km and ic using relative bibliometric indexes.","h index, n index, g index, i index","In global view, in this work it was found that intellectual capital is emerging field and scientific researchers are more productive and have immediate impact than those of knowledge management field, despite its novelty. This study could be extended to other databases (WOS, INSPEC…etc.), to have more representative dataset of a field and with adaptation of computing programs. The impact of research is analyzed and measured using relative bibliometric indexes. Currently, bibliometry finds its most important application in evaluating the performance of scientific research. More recently, bibliometric methods have been used to assess the effectiveness and productivity of research. After the global bibliometric analyses of authors of articles, and the application of the few indexes that have presented beforehand on the programming language R, the results obtained have been compared, the aim of which is to highlight the best destination that contains the information. It is believed that this work was very beneficial for us. We are now able to easily program any other index and find the desired information and using the R language that is now in hand, it is now a rewarding professional experience and encouraging for our future. Finally, and as an outlook for this work, these indexes can be applied to other research areas or other specific queries and propose a complete and user-friendly application for bibliometry.","samia aitouche, hanane zermane, mawloud titah, naima zerari, khaled latreche, abdelghafour kaanit laboratory of automatics and manufacturing, industrial engineering department, university batna2, algeria samiaaitouche@yahoo.fr, hananezermane@yahoo.fr, t.mawloud@yahoo.fr, zerari99@yahoo.fr, khaled_lat@yahoo.fr, k_abdelghafour@yahoo.fr","references par article IC (44,12) is

322,Modeling Infectious Disease In Healthcare Problems For The  Medical Systems Improvement In Bangladesh,"providing proper healthcare to the growing population in bangladesh has become major concern because of the increasing threats of infectious diseases and their rate of mortality. it has been challenging for the healthcare providers to provide optimal treatment of emerging infectious diseases. in recent years, mathematical models have become important tools in analyzing and describing the changing dynamics of healthcare and biomedical systems. the processes in biology and medicine can be, in general, described by mathematical models where the nonlinear ordinary differential equations are the key ingredients. optimal control technique fuels on such analysis in obtaining the optimal control strategies. this technique provides new results by applying the old theories. in this paper, we address some recent developments of modeling the nonlinear behavior of immunotherapeutic treatment of leukemia using adoptive t cell. optimal control technique can be of advantageous to obtain the better strategy as a special feature in some cases. numerical treatment is performed to illustrate the results.","optimal control, healthcare systems","Bangladesh is the most densely populated (75% in rural areas) country in the world and the total population is its manpower. So the ultimate demand is to take immediate necessary steps/treatment so that the leukemia infections can be cured completely. This paper focuses on the fundamental scenarios of leukemia and the nonlinear behavior of immunotherapeutic treatment by using adoptive T cell. A four compartmental model for leukemia has been formulated mathematically and then analyzed numerically. The analysis of the mathematical model and the simulation predictions clarify the mechanisms of the disease propagations and cancer cell interactions in the human body and thus suggest treatment strategies that could be implemented to defend the disease. Since proper medications as well as effective vaccine are still not available for the treatments, this study may help the doctors and biologists for determining and obtaining preventive strategies from this deadly disease leukemia. 7.","mst. shanta khatun and md. haider ali biswas mathematics discipline science engineering and technology school khulna university khulna-9208, bangladesh shantajsku@gmail.com, mhabiswas@yahoo.com",

328,"Life Cycle Assessment, Optimization And Multi Criterions  Dm Models Facing Waste Management Problems Literature","reviewing of numerous studies on waste management suggests that it is affected by a wide variety of economic, social and environmental factors which are themselves the source of the complexity of existing issues and a systemic look in this direction. for this purpose, existing researches has been investigated which here some are classified and enclosed in three areas of life cycle assessment models, multi-criteria optimization models and decision making. additionally, reviewed articles in this areas are referred to the benefits and limitations of each. the results of current paper shows that in the reviewed models, there is no model that considers all three dimensions of environmental, economic, and social sustainability for waste management simultaneously, as well as combining and integrating two or more models and applying them simultaneously to a problem. it is possible that the shortcomings and limitations of each method alone will be eliminated by complementary methods and will usually be more accurate in judgments.",waste management,"This article examines some existing studies in the field of waste management, and researches in literature have been investigated according to the type of problem modeling. Examined articles are categorized in four areas of LCA models, optimization models, and MCDM models. Studies conducted in the LCA area can be categorized into several categories. In some studies, the researcher developed new models based on the LCA framework. Another category of studies in the literature of researchers is merely to evaluate and compare some of the different models in the LCA field of waste. Using LCA as a comparative environmental tool is another class of studies that is sometimes used to compare different waste processing technologies. In this research, just a review of these LCA models has been made. A review of optimization studies showed that comprehensive research in this field, both in terms of sustainability and in terms of technology, has not been carried out. Therefore, the research vacuum that is considered in the sustainable development environment while simultaneously considering all three dimensions of the economic, environmental, and social aspects of designing, modeling and optimizing waste recycling systems is felt. In addition to the comprehensive proposal vacuum, the lack of appropriate research for deciding on the optimal and sustainable use of solid urban waste in Iran is another significant point of this section. Studies in the framework of multi-criteria decision-making techniques have contributed to prioritizing and evaluating different waste processing technologies, as well as prioritizing and evaluating waste disposal sites for decision makers, as well as combining and combining AHP and fuzzy techniques and applying them together in the context of the AHP shortcomings and limitations, the fuzzy complement method is eliminated and usually results in more accuracy in judgments.","review elham rezaei industrial engineering faculty amirkabir university of technology (tehran polytechnic) tehran, iran elhamrezai9@gmail.com kaveh mohammad cyrus industrial engineering faculty amirkabir university of technology (tehran polytechnic) tehran, iran cyrusk@aut.ac.ir abbas ahmadi industrial engineering faculty amirkabir university of technology (tehran polytechnic) tehran, iran abbasahmadi00@gmail.com",
329,On The Relationship Between Lean Supply Chain  Management And Performance Improvement By Adopting,"this article investigates the moderating effect of the adoption of industry 4.0 technologies on the relationship between lean supply chain management (lscm) practices and supply chain performance improvement in the brazilian industry. the study is based on a survey with manufacturing companies to capture the improvement of four supply chain performance indicators considering implementation level of seventeen lscm practices, and ten digital technologies related to industry 4.0. data were analyzed through multivariate data analysis. results indicate that the adoption of industry 4.0 technologies does moderate the relationship between lscm practices and supply chain performance in brazilian industry. however, this moderating effect does not occur at the same extent as expected. the investigation on the effect of the concurrent adoption of industry 4.0 technologies with already established practices, such as lscm ones, in manufacturing companies of emerging countries provides a deeper comprehension of the benefits and challenges to entail greater supply chain performance.","industry 4.0, performance",,"industry 4.0 technologies guilherme luz tortorella, rogério feroldi miorando and carlos ernani fries department of production and systems engineering federal university of santa catarina florianopolis, sc, 88000-900, brazil gluztortorella@gmail.com, miorando@gmail.com, carlos.fries@ufsc.br alejandro mac cawley vergara department of industrial and systems engineering pontifical catholic university of chile santiago, chile amac@ing.puc.cl","References

333,Success Factors For Developing Air Cargo In African Markets,"air cargo in african countries plays a relevant role in developing intra-african trade and enhancing economic prosperity. unlike its great potential and expansion in foreign countries, africa remains the weakest region worldwide. in 2016, according to icao’s forecast, scheduled air traffic compound average annual growth rate (cagr) in africa will reach 2.2 percent freight tonne kilometre (ftk) by 2042 while world air cargo will grow over the next years by 4.2 percent per year. despite of several researches related to airfreight industry little have analysed the factors influencing the growth of african air cargo market. this paper aims to fill a gap of literature by identifying the factors leading the development of african air traffic. moreover, an insight is provided into the actual five cities concentrating the intra-african network namely, cairo, johannesburg, nairobi, addis ababa, and lagos. the results and interpretations have a significant importance for aviation stakeholders who aim to enhance airfreight’s flow in african markets.","air cargo, african aviation, transportation, air cargo hub","African aviation has experienced several policies leading to liberalise intra-African air transport market. The partial implementation of Yamoussoukro Decision (YD) has impacted adversely Aviation industry among the continent. As a result, although air traffic flows have grown significantly, numerous challenges have hampered industry’s development, such as regulatory restrictions, high fares, inadequate infrastructure, lack of safety and facilitation, and poor security. Adds to these constraints, African Airlines’ behaviour has been affected: while intra-African routes have been widely consolidated, small aircraft routes have been abandoned and some African carriers have built new hubs such as Egypt Air, Royal Air Maroc, South African Airways (SAA), Ethiopian Airlines and Kenya Airways. The development of hubs has been successful in Eastern and Southern Africa, than in Central and Western the continent. Hence, regional traffic distribution has been characterized by a notable imbalance. Beyond those serving the market , namely Cairo and Johannesburg, strengthening , development of further competing hubs especially of cargo activity within the continent will play a vital role in enhancing air cargo industry and creating a stronger market at regional and international level.","boutaina hajjar industrial engineering department - emisys mohammadia school of engineers- mohammed v university rabat, 10000, morocco boutaina.hajjar01@gmail.com dr. omar drissi kaitouni industrial engineering department - emisys mohammadia school of engineers- mohammed v university rabat, 10000, morocco drissi@emi.ac.ma",
334,Investigating The Efficiency And Effectiveness Of Project  Execution In A South African Project Based Organisation,"this study was inspired by an organization that has been experiencing delays coupled with cost constraints and quality management issues in the execution of its projects. a research was therefore conducted to investigate the efficiency and effectiveness of project execution in the organization using a qualitative research approach. the research targeted population were all stakeholders in management involved in execution of projects. the study sample was nine participants selected using non-probability purposive sampling and data was collected using semi-structured interviews. the research results showed that correct project management processes were being followed during project execution, however processes implementation was not efficient, communication channels were ineffective, stakeholders were not engaged, resource distribution was ineffectively done leaving other projects with shortages of material. the study revealed that there was lack of skills and training programs resulting in costly corrective measures, lack of monitoring and controlling, risk management is not done effectively, contractors are not well managed, while leadership is experienced differently in various sections. right processes are needed to ensure right governance in the organisation’s execution of projects.","efficiency, effectiveness, project execution, project management, stakeholder","Several factors have been identified that influence the efficiency and effectiveness of project execution in the case study organisation. Some of these contributing factors are related to planning and others to the execution of projects:  Inadequate and inefficient communication within project teams and the organizational environment.  Lack of relevant stakeholder’s involvement and management.  Improper allocation and usage of resources.  Shortage of skills, training and development of project team.  Organisational culture not supportive of completing projects on time.  Poor leadership within the project management unit. In conclusion, the point of departure is that projects that do not learn the lessons from previous failures could be destined to failure in repeating the same errors. The case study organisation must ensure that project post-mortems form part of the key elements in the project methodology to avoid the same pitfalls.","palesa tsotetsi mancosa graduate school of business 16 samora machel st durban central, 4001 durban, rsa palesa.tsotetsi@yahoo.com chipo mugova mancosa graduate school of business 16 samora machel st durban central, 4001 durban, rsa mugovac@gmail.com",
335,Line Balancing In Assembly Line. A Case Study.,"in order to balance an assembly line one has to deal with different concerns as to the way to distribute operations to achieve takt times. nowadays the complexity of assembly operations don’t allow the company to maintain a work balance, which affects the inequity of the workstations’ time and also generates non value added activities that is reflected in the total cycle time. the manufacturing plant of this study manually produces bus chassis, and has two assembly lines: urban chassis (uc) and foreign chassis (fc). the purpose of this research paper is to decrease the operator headcount 20% and to increase de value added to 59% in the assembly line. in order to achieve this paper’s main objective, the research team used a lean six sigma approach and dmaic methodology. the activities completed were generating a balance proposal with the reduction or elimination of non value added activities through kaizens. this paper is relevant for operations management professionals since it represents one of the most studied issues in manufacturing assembly lines, and provides an integrated approach combining different tools to solve this problem in a multinational company.","chassis, value added, line balancing, dmaic","The line balancing is fundamental for a manufacturing company because by equalizing the work times in all the stations, different benefits can be obtained. During this project, different tools of the Lean Six Sigma methodology were carried out that helped to reduce or eliminate the waste founded in the line and then achieve the balancing of all the activities. By implementing Kaizens for each of the teams, the reduction of 28.06% of the activities that were not adding value within the line was achieved, in the same way, with the software of TimerPro, a comparison was made with the previous analysis established, where the Yamazumi for the OH pilot model showed favorable results, as the reduction of times in jobs that were outside the Takt Time from 16 to 6, a decrease in Lead Time to 5.7 hours, increase of added value and a reduction of the headcount in a 20%. For the missing models, a balancing proposal was made. After implementing the improvements for the models and making the implementation of the balancing proposal for the pilot model, the general objective was completed, reaching a percentage of value added of 59% and a headcount reduction of 20%.","michelle eugenia sánchez barrientos, valeria argumedo hinojosa, fabiola mercedes arango garcía, teresa verduzco-garza, fernando gonzález-aleu, jesús vázquez department of engineering universidad de monterrey nuevo león, méxico michelle.sanchez@udem.edu, valeria.argumedo@udem.edu, fabiola.arango@udem.edu",
336,Pricing Optimization And Seat Inventory Allocation For  Intercity Passenger Train Services,"in this research, a practical approach to estimating demand function for pricing optimization and seat inventory allocation of intercity passenger railway services was developed. willingness-to-pay approach was used for estimating demand. demand for the service was estimated from choice-based conjoint data using hierarchical bayes estimation method. the proportion of customers willing to buy a certain service was estimated using market simulation. monotonic cubic spline interpolation was used to estimate the price-response function. the size of maximum demand achievable was estimated from sales data. the approach was implemented to the largest intercity passenger train service in indonesia. two customer segments were assumed, i.e. business and leisure passengers, with four fare classes. our first optimization problem sought to determine optimal capacity allocation for the existing fare classes. the second optimization problem aimed to determine optimal fare and the corresponding optimal capacity allocation for each fare class. solution to the nonlinear pricing optimization problem was obtained using enumeration. subsequently, the popular expected marginal seat revenue-a (emsr-a) heuristic was used for the seat allocation inventory problem.","willingness-to-pay, hierarchical bayes","and Future Works This research developed optimization models for pricing and seat allocation of intercity passenger train services. An approach to estimating one of the most important component of the model, the demand function, based on consumer demand theory was proposed. The HB estimation method, which provides utility estimates at individual level, coupled with market simulation have been a practical and flexible yet accurate way for deriving demand functions. The practicality is due to the availability of software for designing the questionnaire, administering the online survey, estimating the utilities, simulating the market scenario, and estimating the demand function. The flexibility comes from the market simulation which can imitate any competitive scenario and estimate how the market will react accordingly. It is also claimed to be more accurate since the utilities are estimated at individual level and the demand function is interpolated straightforward as the simulation output suggests without assuming any a priori demand function. The disadvantage of using the approach proposed in this paper is when it comes to the pricing optimization. Since the approach does not result in an explicit demand function, analytical solution is impossible. To some extent, enumeration is possible, but for larger problem, this will be cumbersome. The implementation of the approach in a case study of intercity passenger train service has shown the efficacy of the approach. From the protection levels and booking limits implied by the current fares, it could be inferred that the current fares were too low. The pricing optimization with imposing upper bound on tariff resulted in an increase in average fare, but the corresponding protection levels and booking limits suggested that the fares were still too low. Optimization without upper bound on tariff resulted in an estimated 20% increase in revenue. Despite its efficacy, a few details on the implementation are still worth noting i.e. determining the appropriate satiating price, assumption regarding the probability distribution of price, and the size of the problem when the number of segment becomes a decision variable. This research assumed that the demand function was deterministic. In fact, the shares of preference from the market simulation were probabilistic. Hence, a more realistic approach to the pricing optimization problem would be assuming probabilistic demand. The research also assumed that there was no cancellation. Modeling approach to relaxations regarding these assumptions would be the future research agenda. Acknowledgements Authors thank PT.

337,"An Integrated Approach With Moora, Swara, And  Waspas Methods For Selection Of 3Plsp","mobile production in india has already crossed the 100-million-units mark, and is set to touch 500 million in the next two years. reverse supply chain logistics, means mobility of goods from end consumers towards core manufacturer in the channel of product distribution. in the turbulent business environment, the companies must promote alternative uses of resources that may be cost-effective and ecology friendly by extending products’ routine life cycles. reveres logistics activities i.e. storing, transporting and handling of used products poses a great challenge to reverse logistics managers as there is always chances of uncertainty in terms of quantity, quality and timing of return of eol products in case of reverse supply chains. in the present work problem related to recovery of used cell phones is formulated by various mcdm approaches namely moora (multi-objective optimization by ratio analysis), swara (step- wise weight assessment ratio) and waspas (weighted aggregated sum product assessment). swara method is used to find the criterion weight of alternative and the other methods such as moora and waspas is used to give the rankings of alternatives and chooses the best alternative from the rest. all known multi-attribute methods cannot value the attribute weights as one weight of attribute is higher or lower significant than the other attribute, swara allows expert opinion about significance ratio of the attributes in the process of rational decision determination. in waspas method, we combine the subjective weight expressed by decision makers with objective weights to obtain more realistic weights which help to increase the stability of the proposed approach. this approach is efficient and well consistent with other methods. moora method is a general method and can consider any number of quantitative and qualitative attributes simultaneously and offer a more objective and simple decision making-approach. the present approach links the financial and nonfinancial, tangible and intangible, internal and external factors, thus providing a holistic framework for the selection of an alternative for the reverse logistics operations for eol cell phones. many criteria, sub-criteria, determinants, etc. for the selection of reverse manufacturing options are interrelated. thus, mcdm methods proposed in this paper provides a more realistic and accurate representation of the problem for conducting remanufacturing logistics operations for eol cell phones in indian business environment.","moora, swara","Ranking of alternatives was performed applying WSM, WPM methods, a joint criterion of weighted aggregation of the latter methods such as WASPAS, also the ratio system and the","*arvind jayant and shweta singh department of mechanical engineering sant longowal institute of engg. & technology, longowal, sangrur, punjab – 148106 (india) (deemed to be university under mhrd govt. of india) *corresponding author email id :arvindjayant@gmail.com, shwetasingh.igit@gmail.com s. k. garg department of mechanical engineering, delhi technological university, delhi-110042 (india) e-mail: skgarg63@yahoo.co.in","REFERENCES

342,Bioethanol Production From Corn Residue,"currently, many developing countries are facing fuel challenges while corn stover waste remains unutilized. this study utilized excess corn stover to make bioethanol a value added product by designing a plant that manufactures 150 tons per day of 99.5% pure cellulosic bioethanol operating over a 10-year period. the process that converted crude corn stover to cellulosic bioethanol was evaluated for conversion via hydrolysis of lignocelluloses in the corn stover then the cofermentation of the carbon 5 and carbon 6 monosaccharides obtained from the hydrolysis process. the hydrolysis process is a route to the bioethanol through 86% co-fermentation of carbon 5 and carbon 6 sugars obtained from the 75% saccharification of corn stover to fermentable sugars to produce 99.5% pure cellulosic bioethanol that can be used to blend petrol. the economic analyses indicated a payback period of 1.5 years, a rate of return on investment of 86%, and a selling price of $1.10/liter for the bioethanol that indicated the feasibility of the project. waste corn stover to bioethanol technology can be applied as a waste management tool to meet energy demands in agro-based industries.","bioethanol, biofuels, corn stover",The production of 150 tons per day of cellulosic bioethanol from corn stover is technically and economically feasible as a waste management technology while meeting energy needs. The designed plant will be innovative because it optimizes the process by allowing the co-fermentation of C5 and C6 sugars to obtain a substantial yield of cellulosic bioethanol from corn stover selling at $1.1/L.

345,Developing A Risk Assessment Model For Nontechnical Risk In Energy Sector,"risk management is one of the most relevant approaches and systematic applications of strategies, procedures and practices management that have been introduced in literatures for identifying and analysing risks which exist through the whole life of a product ,a process or services. therefore, the aim of this paper is to propose a risk assessment model that will be implemented to the energy sector, particularly to power plants. this model combines the analytic hierarchy process (ahp) technique with a new enhanced balance score card (bsc). ahp is constructed to determine the weights and the priorities for all perspectives and risk indicators that involved in the bsc. the novelty in this paper is not only in using the bsc for risk assessment, but also, in developing a new bsc with six perspectives, which are sustainability perspective; economic; learning and growth; internal and operational business process; supply chain and customer/demand perspective. another three contributions of this paper are firstly, including the sustainability dimension in bsc, and covering nine risk categories, which comprise 84 risk indicators that have been distributed across the six risk bsc perspectives. secondly, assessing the non-technical risks in power plants and finally, this research will concentrate on the strategic level instead of the operational level where the majority of researches focus on latter but the former is far less researched. the created model will provide an effective measurement for the risks particularly, in the power plants sector. the results of this study demonstrate that the supply chain risks perspective is the keystone for the decision making process. furthermore, these risk indicators with the new structure of bsc with six perspectives, help in achieving the organisation mission and vision in addition to affording a robust risk assessment model. the inputs of this model are composed from a previous stage using a modified failure mode and effect analysis (fmea) (which has been used the exponential weighted geometric mean (ewgm)) to understand and analyse all risks, after which, the results of the developed fmea which are the risk priority numbers (rpn’s), have been used to build the ahp-bsc risk model. these risks are collected with difficulty from various literatures. this study will be validated in the next stage in power plants in the middle east.",,"The developed FMEA methodology that has been used in this research can boost effective decision-making about risks, improve power plants towards risk management, and assist the top management to have an acceptable and preferable understanding of the organisation than lower level managers do who are close more to the day-to-day (tactical plan) organisational operations. Additionally, the results of EWGM-RPN help in developing the AHP model by assigning the comparison importance across each risk indicator. Furthermore, the improved method overcomes some drawbacks in the traditional FMEA in simple way where this will provide more accurate, practical and reasonable results. The results of this study demonstrate that the supply chain risks perspective (production risks, disruption risks) is the keystone for the decision making process followed by internal and operational business process perspective. The developed risk scorecard framework with six perspectives could be an effective tool for risk assessment, where the BSC help in understanding all the selected risk in the appropriate perspective while the AHP provides weights for each perspective and for each risk indicator. As a whole, these results will be changed depending on power plant and the policy of the country. For example, some of these risks particularly, the economics risks are limited (ex. the power plants transactions in U.S. Dollar have negligible exchange risk since the currency is fixed compared with the U.S. Dollar). Similarly, the generating companies have not been exposed to credit risk because the only client of the company is the National Company in that country, as it is wholly owned by the government. Moreover, the supply risk has a high RPN value comparing with other risk categories and this is because the country depends on the imported fossil fuel to generate electricity (Central Electricity Generating Company/Jordan, 2016).

346,Design Of A Centralized Warehouse Layout And Operation Flow  For The Automotive Industry: A Simulation Approach,"nowadays, world dynamics and the competition between companies are becoming more aggressive, such as the automotive industry, so their industrial and business models need to be transformed as well to compete. more products with high complexity lead to an end to end logistics model design, but the implementation becomes tough and difficult. the main purpose of this project was to elevate the performance execution of the materials storage strategy, designing and simulating the operation flow of a centralized warehouse, in order to reduce missing critical materials and controlling the supply of the materials at the assembly lines. the designed model is supported by lean techniques and warehouse design and management techniques, integrating different tools to identify non-value adding activities and, therefore, to design a lean material flow, distribution, and operation of the new flexible and integrated storage center facility. the supply chain also become redesigned improving the kpi’s performance at the assembly lines. previous lean manufacturing studies and its effects were mostly applied to production systems, whereas lean studies in warehouse are scarce. this document provides a substantial contribution for the design of material supply systems using lean principles improving performance of the centralized storage operations and the supply to the shop floor according to the simulation results.",,"One of the transcendental logistical decisions in an organization is the way in which inventories are handled. During the project, methodologies served as support during the planning and construction of the logistics and storage strategy. With this, ""the allocation of inventories to the storage points against the exit to the storage points by inventory supply rules, represent two strategies"" (Ballou, 2004, p. 40). The selective location of different items in the centralized warehouse and the management of inventory levels through the use of different methods of inventory control, are other strategies. Taking this into account, the intervention of the team was of utmost importance for the organization, because the proposed strategic objectives of service improvement were met, and even exceeded.

347,A Locating-Routing Model For Hazardous Materials  Transport Planning Based On Time Value Of Money For,"transportation of hazardous materials (hazmat for short) has always raised authorities’ concerns about the potential risks to humans and environment. but hazmat transportation plays an important role to the economy in both developed and developing countries. in addition to the selection of routes from the origin to destination, hazmat transportation often includes facilities that may also known as the sources of potential risks for environment. thus, it is necessary to address the integration of locating and routing decisions from both economic and safety aspects. the mail purpose of the present paper is to develop a mathematical model to find optimum sites for the construction of fuel distribution centers as well as to determine different states of lifetime for the construction of those during the operating period to reduce the total costs of the project. both construction and transportation costs are given based on the time value of money which is the contribution of the present research work. the objective function is defined at two levels in which the first level specifies the total network risk and the second level aims to find the construction sites with their respective lifetime considering the value of the establishing and operating costs. the proposed model has been validated using experimental data in the selected case study of the northwest region of iran. the results revealed that considering time value of money in hazmat transport planning plays a significant role over locating the optimum sites as fuel distribution centers, so local or national authorities who are dealing with hazmat transportation can utilize the proposed model to find the best locations of fuel distribution centers.",hazardous materials,"Since, Hazmat transport is a main concern in transport planning a bi-level objective model has been developed for solving locating and routing problem. The first level of objective function determines the risk of the network and its value is included in the second level as a constraint. The second level solves the model to specify the extent of Hazmat transportation from each distribution center to the destinations and to locate the distribution centers among the candidate sites. For validating the proposed model, the northwest part of Iran has been selected as case study and results have been analyzed. Results revealed that while risk tolerance is increased, the proposed model is capable to find better routes over the network. For the future studies, it is recommended to work more on considering time value of money during different combinations of periods while they are assumed as variables. 2592","establishing and operating costs (case study: northwest area of iran) hamideh baghaei daemi msc. in industrial engineering, mehrastan university, guilan, iran solmazbaghaie@gmail.com abbas mahmoudabadi director, master program in industrial engineering, mehrastan university, guilan, iran mahmoudabadi@mehrastan.ac.ir roozbeh azizmohammadi faculty of industrial engineering, ie department, payame noor university, tehran, iran roozbeh_mie@yahoo.com","References

348,Productivity Gains Through Pdca Approach In An  Auto Service Station,"improving productivity by eliminating the unnecessary activities have always been the vital prospects in an automobile service parts station. this paper is a case study in the service station of a reputed organization where rejections were monitored on the daily basis starting from finding root cause of rejection followed by action plans. productivity of the service station is improved using pdca tool of lean manufacturing. during the study, it was observed that the services offered by the service station was not sometimes well received by the customers and there are still areas for amendments. by using the pdca tool the productivity was improved significantly by reducing the overall time that was previously consumed in unnecessary activities i.e. changing daily rejections monitoring process to weekly monitoring process. the time saved could thus be used in other productive activities of service station and the rejections got maintained in each quality gate thereby boosting the employee morale and customer satisfaction.","lean manufacturing, productivity, pdca, kaizen","Lean is characterized as a procedure for accomplishing critical consistent change in execution through the disposal of all squanders of assets and time in the aggregate business prepare. Its standards apply to almost all business operations, from the organization and item configuration to equipment preparations. Lean assembling is about dispensing with waste and non-esteem included assignments. Lean thinking eliminates waste for an organization even if it not manufacturing i.e. can be applicable to service stations as well. In the current study, the Kaizen tool under which PDCA working methodology was selected to eliminate waste in form of unnecessary activities and time as well. After analyzing the case processes at the service station, it is concluded that:  Daily analysis of rejections was adding waste of time in form of unnecessary activities.  Weekly analysis revealed not much effect on rejection rate because all stations were still under target limit set by the organization itself and resulted in saving of time to almost seven hours a week.  Employee morale also get boosted because of the improved work flow and enhanced productivity of plant which are very important for any organization to get a competitive edge over others. 6.1.

349,Ranking The Needs Of Students With Disabilities At The  University Of Sharjah And Identifying The State Of The Art Of,"every human being has the right for education regardless of her or his culture, race or disability. students with disabilities are having a challenging experience when they go through the education stages during their life. education institutions should care about the needs of students with disabilities and try to do whatever is needed to accommodate them in the education programs. therefore, the purpose of this paper is to identify the needs of students with disabilities and identify the available assistive technologies used with the various types of disabilities. based on the results of a literature review, legal documents, and iso standards, it was possible to identify eight needs for the students with disabilities. furthermore, we identified the state of the art of the technologies that are internationally available and being used with five types of disabilities, i.e. deafness, blindness, dyslexia, physical disability, and autism. benchmarking university of sharjah’s assistive technologies with best practices at other international universities enables the university of sharjah to know where it stands with respect to other’s best practices. furthermore, they can develop the needed strategies required to adopt the best practices, which will enhance the disabled student’s life in the campus.",disability needs,"In this paper it was possible to identify the needs of the students with disability, validate these needs and rank them with the help of expert opinion. It was found that there is a need to improve the “awareness level” of the people who are dealing (indirectly/directly) with disabled students, since it got the highest importance weight. This was followed second by the need to “the disability support services”. In third place comes the need of more “assistive technologies”, followed by “adjustment in educational systems”. The least important need was the “sports”, preceded by “accessibility in facilities”. Knowing these results can help the decision maker to prioritize what should be improved first and initiate improvement projects accordingly. The details of the methodology of using the multi-criteria decision-making tool will be presented in another future paper. For one of these needs, i.e., assistive technologies, in this paper we identified the state of the art of the technologies that are internationally available and being used with five types of disabilities. These five types of disabilities are the ones that are being dealt with by the Disability Resource Centre at the university of Sharjah, i.e. deafness, blindness, dyslexia, physical disability, and autism. The results will help Disability Resource Centre to Benchmark the University of Sharjah’s assistive technologies with best practices at other international universities which enables the university of Sharjah to understand where does it stand with respect to others best practices and develop the needed strategies to adopt the best practices which will enhance the disabled student’s life in the campus. Acknowledgement We would like to thank the Director of the Disability Resource Center Ms. Fatima Ibrahim and Ms. Manaal who provided the needed support, data, knowledge i.e expert opinion that greatly assisted this research. We would also like to thank all other staff which helped us understand available assistive technology at the Disability Resource Center.","assistive technologies mohamed adam *a, saif alkhaja a, mohammed alsafadi a, mohammed baraa sayour a, sadeque hamdan *, and imad alsyouf *a *sustainable engineering asset management (seam) research group, aindustrial engineering and engineering management department university of sharjah sharjah, united arab emirates m.saradam96@gmail.com, saif.alkhaja@gmail.com, m.alsafadi@live.co.uk, lt.sayour@gmail.com, shamdan@sharjah.ac.ae, ialsyouf@sharjah.ac.ae",
350,Improving Self-Cleaning System For De-Fouling Thermal  Power Plant Heat Exchangers: Case Study,"fouling of heat transfer tubes was major threat on the heat transfer efficiency of the condenser at the case study thermal power plant. such that the mechanical methods used to clean the tubes were inefficient in dealing with the increasing precipitation of insoluble metal salts on the tube walls, which in turn impeded the heat transfer process. a the system of injecting spherical rubber balls into the cooling water along its flow along the tube to scrub dirty on the tube surfaces as well as to create turbulence which disturbs the settling of the dirty on the tube walls was investigated using finite element analysis. ball sizes of diameter less than tube size were considered favorable so as to carter for possible thermal linear expansion of the rubber material on exposure to temperature. a magnetic water treatment unit was also added to enable the formation of weak precipitates of the metal salts, which has reduced tendency to stick onto the tube walls. this system was found to achieve substantial savings in terms of reducing downtime on condenser cleaning at the thermal power plant. 1.introduction the case study thermal power plant was using the shell and tube heat exchangers for condensing exhaust steam from the turbine. the cooling water passing at the tube side tended to cause gathering of deposits on flowing through the tubes. these deposits increased with time as minerals like calcium and magnesium formed insoluble salt precipitates in the pipe interior wall – this formation of scale build up inside the condenser surfaces cause fouling whic3333h effectively reduces heat transfer surface. this is normally exacerbated by use of raw cooling water, in case of ducts which are not being cleaned they are also chances of the deposition of mud inside the condenser tubes. prolonged fouling consequently rises frictional resistance to waters flow due to the dirty layers hence fluid mal-distribution as well as reduced velocity on flow. also fouling layers are of low thermal conductivity such that they are overall losses in heat transfer causing the decrease in efficiency (fayard & verona, 2011). common offline mechanical cleaning methods such as molded plastics cleaners (pigs) or wire brushes are used to remove off deposits in the tubes when the condenser is not functioning. in some cases, chemical cleaning is also used to dissolve the deposits (xu, et al., 2016). both these methods require prior plant shutdown to use them and they fail to return the original tube cleanliness. for that reason, heat exchangers which carry out the cleaning process whilst in operation would be preferred as a way to reduce unplanned shutdowns which adversely affect production cost of energy. thus fouling will be eliminated at an early stage to prevent cases of build-up of these tenacious deposits. 2. fouling in heat exchangers 2.1 forms of fouling fouling can be considered to be the build-up of undesirable deposits on the sides of the heat exchanger tubes is dependent on the nature of the fluid in flow. it falls into two distinct categories namely macro and micro fouling. © ieom society international 3042",,", both designs are safe because the attained Von Mises stress of the models is lower than the corresponding yield strength in both cases. It is of significant importance for the operators of the set cleaning system to be fully knowledgeable on the operational parameters and components available. This ensures for safety and ability to identify if the system is working according to its intended operation. Therefore an optimum performance is achievable since external disturbances can be avoided if the system is clearly known. An automated system is used to control the ball injection and collection cycles. The valves in the system receive set commands from the PLC at specified times in the cycles. This unit saves the labor of tiresome on off operations of the multiple pipe line valves. Sight glasses on the ball collector and the strainer site save for the inspection of ball availability and if any ball is stuck on the strainer. Control valves are incorporated in the system to allow for required flow path at different intervals of the cycles. This exercise ensured for the identification and eradication of hazards associated with the developed system.

351,Design Improvement Of Off-Road Rough Uneven Rural  Terrain Wheelchair,"this design study reviewed the redesign of a manual wheelchair for the rural terrain where difficulties are faced in maneuvering the currently existing wheelchairs due to uneven and rough terrain particularly with sandy, sloping ground, and poor road system which makes moving almost impossible. possible concepts which address these challenges were developed, evaluated and improved to come up with a mechanism that takes into account the lack of balance and difficulty in maneuvering. a detailed design was done including the calculations, generation of drawings of the component parts and sizing of the parts of the wheelchair. the wheelchair was designed for occupants of healthy upper torso with pelvic to foot restraint. 1. introduction a wheelchair is an assistive device which enhances personal mobility and facilitates participation, for a person with walking limitation. it is estimated that over 75% of the world’s population lives in rural areas, where standard conventional wheelchairs just do not work: as they are hard to push, they break easily, and cannot be repaired easily. wheelchair designs vary to enable users to safely and effectively use their wheelchairs in the environment in which they live and work(cooper, 2008).a wheelchair that is used primarily in rough outdoor environments needs to be robust, more stable and easier to propel over rough and uneven ground. disabled people in rural areas are facing problems with the current available conventional 4-wheeledwheelchairs because of uneven and rough terrain especially with sandy, stony, sloping ground, steep ramps and poor road systems which make moving these manual wheelchairs almost impossible. these wheelchairs do not fully meet the needs of the users such as to travel longer distances, therefore, there is a need to come up with a wheelchair design that can be used in the rural environment and terrain without any constraints. 2. literature review 2.1 wheel concept and functions a wheelchair is a device that comes in variations allowing either manual propulsion by the seated occupant turning the rear wheels by hand or electric propulsion by motors. there are often handles behind the seat to allow for different individuals to push. according to the world health organization, a wheelchair is an assistive technological device which enhances personal mobility, promotes functional independence and facilitates participation, for a person with walking limitation. (cooper ra, 2002).wheelchair design and functionality as a whole has been greatly improved over the past several years, but there is still a need for new technology and innovative designs. a basic manual wheelchair incorporates a seat, foot rests and four wheels: two caster wheels at the front and two large wheels at the back. the two larger wheels in the back usually have hand rims; two metal or plastic circles approximately 3/4"" thick. the hand rims have a diameter normally only slightly smaller than the wheels they are 2613 proceedings of the 2nd european conference on industrial engineering and operations management (ieom) paris, france, july 26-27, 2018",,"It has been established that the currently used wheelchairs have many challenges in maneuvering in the rough and uneven terrain in rural areas. The wheelchairs lack sufficient balance in maneuvering on steep slopes and banked roads. To address these challenges associated with existing wheelchairs, a design concept was developed for a well balanced mechanism wheelchair. A completed design of the chosen concept was carried out. The design has a provision for anti-tipper wheels to enhance balance of the wheelchair.

352,Design Of An Automated Dam Shutter Control System:  Case Study,"this work study was done to come up with an optimised design of an automated dam shutter system to monitor the level of water, pressure and flow of water at the case study dam site. the failure to monitor the opening and closing of dam gates has resulted in insufficient supply of water, water wastages and a lot of human errors associated with manual gate control mechanism. the designed control system was intended to reduce these shortcomings. the design incorporated servo- motors, mechanical hoist system and the electronic control to monitor the flow of water according to water level at any given time. 1. introduction mostly water outlets for dams are manually operated, resulting in failure to effectively supply water from the dams for the purpose of irrigation, to control floods, as well as improve industrial uses such as hydro-electric power generation resulting in unwanted water wastages (muhammad et al 2012). the importance of water in our daily life cannot be over emphasised, hence its distribution and usage water is of utmost consideration. the initiative to introduce automation and monitoring control system to manage dam water enables reliability and the same system helps monitor vibrations of the dam structure to ensure safety and detects early wall collapse warning collapse signs to avert any disaster. it is also robust for use in remote, confined and dangerous locations (anon n.d.). such installations will prove to be much economical in the long run although the initial cost of implementing the system could be high. 2. dam outlet works 2.1 mechanical dam outlet works basically a dam is a physical barrier constructed across flowing water course; to control, direct, hold or raise level of water. non-corrosive materials such as concrete, wood and steel are used in its construction(muhammad et al. 2012). there are many ways of preserving water through providing dams with spillway or gates systems to safely pass a broad range of flows over or through the dam(bhardwaj et al. 2014). the configuration of gates used to block or pass a broad range of flow of water is dependent on the operation, application, purpose and location. the most common type is the outlet head regulator gates. © ieom society international 2627",,The study came up a design to incorporate an automated dam sluice gate control system to handle floods risks and unnecessary water wastages the outlet penstocks. The design entailed the electric motor selection rated at 1750 rpm connected to the right angle worm gear of 60:1 speed reduction. The chain drive would provide speed reduction of 2:1 to the driven sprocket that drives the lifting nut. The overall speed reduction of the system is 120:1 from the motor. The rotational speed of the lifting nut is 14.5 rpm that enable the stem to move up and down. The stem moves 8mm in one revolution of the lifting nut. Considering the safety factor of 1.3 between the rotation of the steel screw and the bronze nut. As the diameter of the penstock pipe is 400mm it takes 2.65 minutes (2minutes and 40sec) to fully open the full diameter pipe.

354,Vehicle Routing Problem For Blood Mobile Collection  System With Stochastic Supply,"the mobile collection system of blood products is considered in this study. blood centers often use bloodmobiles that park near crowded places where donors can donate blood directly. we propose the use of additional vehicles, called shuttles, that pick up the collected blood by the bloodmobiles. hence, bloodmobiles can continue their tours without having to return to the blood center. the system manager must decide the set of sites to visit by the bloodmobiles among a group of potential sites, and to determine the tours of the vehicles responsible for this operation. in this paper, the blood mobile collection system is modelled as a vehicle routing problem with profits. the objective is to minimize the total routing, wastage and shortage costs. each collection site has a random potential blood quantity that is modeled as a stochastic profit which can be collected by a vehicle when it visits this site. a two-stage stochastic model with recourse is developed to represent the problem using a scenario-based approach. the fast-forward selection algorithm is implemented to reduce the set of scenarios. experiments are performed considering poisson distributed profits.","blood supply chain, blood products, scenario reduction","This paper presents a study to optimize the decisions in the mobile collection system of blood products with two types of vehicles: bloodmobiles and shuttles. The challenge of optimizing process in the Blood Supply Chain and its vital importance have motivated us to start this research. This paper adapts the Vehicle Routing Problem with Profits with the objective of minimizing the total routing, wastage and shortage costs. Each collection site has a random blood collection potential following a Poisson distribution function that is modeled as a stochastic profit collected by a vehicle when it visits a site. A Two-Stage Stochastic Model with recourse is developed to represent the problem using a scenario-based approach. The fast-forward selection algorithm is implemented to reduce the set of scenarios. One of the challenges of stochastic programming is the size of the problems and the solution of these in reasonable computational times. For future research related to the mobile collection system of blood products modeled as a two- stage problem, it is proposed to evaluate scenarios reduction methods to obtain shorter solution times. In addition to this, approximation methods can be used for stochastic models such as the L-Shape Method or Cutting Plane Approximation. Heuristics, Markov processes or other solution methods can be developed to optimize the blood supply chain proposed in this study. Possible extensions of the model proposed are to consider that the bloodmobile can be parked more than one day in a potential site depending on the profit of the site. It can also be considered that the shuttle makes more visits during the day to the bloodmobiles in operation to analyze how this activity affects the average age of blood products in the supply chain. 7.","andrea pirabán ramírez logistic systems research group, school of engineering universidad de la sabana campus puente del común, km. 7, autopista norte de bogotá. chía, cundinamarca, colombia icd-losi université de technologie de troyes 12 rue marie curie, cs 42060 10004 troyes cedex, france andreapira@unisabana.edu.co, andreapiraban_ramirez@utt.fr nacima labadie icd-losi université de technologie de troyes 12 rue marie curie, cs 42060 10004 troyes cedex, france nacima.labadie@utt.fr william javier guerrero rueda logistic systems research group, school of engineering universidad de la sabana campus puente del común, km. 7, autopista norte de bogotá. chía, cundinamarca, colombia william.guerrero1@unisabana.edu.co",

357,Preferred Team Roles Of Construction Professionals In The  South African Construction Industry,"in the delivery of construction projects, different participants are brought together. the successful delivery of such project depends on the ability of these participants to function as a team. identifying each individual’s preferred team role is crucial for the smooth running of the team and successful delivery of the project. this paper presents the result of an assessment of the team roles of construction professionals in johannesburg and ekurhuleni metropolitan municipalities, gauteng, south africa. the study adopted the belbin’s theory on teamwork, and a questionnaire was used to gather data from construction professionals. data gathered were analyzed using appropriate descriptive statistics. the study reveals that the preferred team roles of these professionals are team-worker and completer, while the least preferred role are plant, and specialist roles. although the delivery of construction project is team oriented which can be responsible for construction professionals to naturally fall within the “team-worker” role, it should be understood that some workers are bound to fit in better within other team roles as a result of some inherent abilities. therefore construction leaders should know about these team roles so that they can find out the type of behaviors they have in their teams.","belbin theory, construction team, south africa","This study assessed the team roles of construction professionals within the South African construction industry. Using the Belbin theory on teamwork, a survey was conducted to identify the preferred team roles among construction professionals within in the City of Johannesburg and Ekurhuleni Metropolitan Municipalities, Gauteng, South Africa. Base on the finding, the study concludes that the preferred team roles of these professionals are team- worker, and completer, while the least preferred role are plant and specialist. The delivery of successful construction projects involves teamwork; hence it is not surprising to see construction professionals falling suitably into the role of a team-worker. However, this does not negate the fact that there are some workers, who as a result of their inherent ability, tend to perform better in other team roles, than just being a team-worker. It is therefore recommended that construction leaders know about these team roles so that they can find out the type of behaviors they have in their teams. Also if each individual team member knows exactly the type of team role the other team member play, it will be easier for them to understand and work effectively with them. Thus, construction participants on a project need to be enlightened on the different team roles and how they can fit in well with the established team for the project.","douglas aghimien, ayodeji oke, clinton aigbavboa, and nokuphila ntuli sustainable human settlement and construction research centre, faculty of engineering and the built environment, university of johannesburg, south africa aghimiendouglas@yahoo.com, emayok@gmail.com, caigbavboa@uj.ac.za, ntuli.nokuphila@gmail.com",

An Empirical Study,"due to the existing transport risk on hazardous materials transportation, it is very essential to prevent risk agglomeration over the most frequently used edges of the intercity road network. although, there are many approaches for risk distribution over the network, but the main concern is to select the best approach. therefore, three different techniques including bounded proportional risk, minimizing the maximum loaded risk, and minimizing risk absolute errors have been investigated through developing their proposed risk distribution models. after developing corresponding models, the well-known criterion of risk variation (total variance) has been selected for comparing the performances of three techniques. in order to check the proposed models’ validities, the medium size of guilan intercity road network, located at the northern part of iran, including 46 nodes and 126 two-way edges has been selected as case study. three mathematical models have been run using experimental data of network structure as well as hazmat origin-destination matrix and results revealed that the minimizing the maximum loaded risk technique is the best one for risk distribution over the intercity road network in hazmat transportation.",risk distribution,"In this research work, three different approaches of distributing bounded proportional risk, maximum risk as well as the absolute magnitude error have been developed and investigated for Hazmat risk distribution over the road network.

369,Biomimicry Problem-Based Approach As A Strategy For  Sustainable Innovations In The Construction Industry,"the rate of globalisation around the world and the corresponding emergence of innovative technologies daily calls for an efficient and sustainable learning strategy for professionals. it is therefore imperative for professionals to be well-equipped with requisite knowledge and skills to maintain relevance in their field of practice in tandem with the global sustainability paradigm. nature is notably a rich source of inspiration for high performance, resource efficient, and innovative solutions due to its over 3.8 billion years of evolutionary refinement. hence, biomimicry, a field that study and emulate nature’s forms, processes and strategies to find sustainable solutions to human challenges. this paper sets out to explore the biomimicry problem-based approach as exhibited by nature, in maintaining relevance and sustainability. a quantitative research method was adopted and a structured questionnaire was used for data collection. data analysis reveals the systematic approaches towards understanding and emulating the mechanisms behind the survival, sustenance and longevity of organisms in nature. the outcome of this study will provide professionals and other stakeholders in the construction industry with a nature-inspired approach for achieving sustainable innovative solutions.","biomimicry, sustainability, nature","and Recommendation The study has shown the existence of a gap in the learning path of professionals in keeping abreast with the consistent changing and advancing technological terrain. In keeping to date with these changes in maintaining relevance, professionals are now heading outside the box and consulting with the natural environment proven to be of high performance. However, one major hindrance to this effort identified in literature is the lack of a comprehensive and well-defined approach for adopting, applying and incorporating nature’s blueprint that have made them to become models, measures, and mentors of sustainability. However, the study showed that professionals agreed that the application of the stages involved in the problem-based approach of biomimicry would offer sustainable learning process. Though, the pattern of this approach follows a progression of different steps. It is an approach effectively spearheaded by engineers, innovators, and designers identifying preliminary design objectives and frameworks (El Ahmar, 2011). Here, the professionals look to the living world for solutions by first identifying the challenges with biologists needed to correspond these to organisms that have resolved similar cases (Zari, 2007). Hence, the need for multidisciplinary collaboration among the professionals in order to maximize the in-depth knowledge and learning pattern that nature has to offer through biomimicry. Awareness, training, and education of professionals on this significant biomimicry approach should also be encouraged for its adoption and application to be widely embraced. Integration of biomimicry into the university curricula and likewise the continuous professional development activities of professional bodies is therefore highly recommended. It is also recommended that government and other authorities, with the full support and partnership of professional bodies, should put in place policies and frameworks that will be encourage the adoption and application of biomimicry. This is believed will result in the birth of innovative and novel technological solutions with sustainable characteristics to human challenges.

From the findings relating to the demo-graphic aspect of the study, it can be concluded that construction education is studied by people of various cultural groups: Africans, whites, Indians or Asians and coloreds, which indicates that all the ethnic groups were represented in the study. Also, the findings indicate that construction students are registered for courses in Quantity Surveying, Construction Management, Civil Engineering and Building Science. It can also be concluded that the majority of the respondents were young people who are from different cultural backgrounds. The findings also revealed that majority of the respondents take part in collaborative learning once a week or two to three times a week or more. Additionally, most of the respondents were of the view that collaborative learning is effective. Furthermore, majority of the students are aware that they are working with people from different cultural backgrounds. It can also be concluded that for construction related programmes, students did their experiential learning between a period of six months and 12 months. It is also evident from the study that experiential training has an influence in encouraging students to find greater meaning in their studies and in providing students with exposure to the real world of work.

372,Impact Of Culture On Construction Education In South  Africa,"the purpose of this study is to assess the impact of culture on construction education in south africa with a view to determining how cultural backgrounds influence students’ behavior. the data used in this paper were derived from both primary and secondary sources. the secondary data were collected through a detailed assessment of related literature. the primary data were likewise collected via a structured questionnaire aimed at 130 respondents who were students registered for construction management (cm), quantity surveying (qs), civil engineering and building science at a south african higher education institution. out of the collected 130 questionnaires, only 101 were usable, representing a response rate of 78 per cent that was deemed viable for statistical analysis for this study. data received from the questionnaires were analyzed using descriptive statistics procedures. the higher education institution used for the study has a variety of students and lecturers: through this study it is evident that the cultural background of the students shapes their attitudes and values, knowledge base as well as the skill set and these, in turn, influencing classroom behaviors, their study habits, their writing styles and faculty student interactions. the study concluded that culture is an important concept when it comes to education, especially construction education, which needs to be managed appropriately. the study, therefore, recommended that in order to manage cultural differences, students need to be aware of the cultural backgrounds of those with whom they work and interact since failure to manage cultural differences in a collaborative learning environment could possibly lead to student failure.","culture, namibia","and Implications of Research Findings The findings indicated that cultural background influences the construction students’ values more than the other factors such as attitude, student interactions, the study habits, classroom behaviour, the writing styles, the ability to change, the knowledge base, the influence on the skill set, and the abilities to learn. Furthermore, most of the respondents reported that they refer to their lecturers by their titles and surnames and only a few of the respondents said that they use either ‘Sir/Madam’ or they just refer to their lecturers by name. A failure to manage cultural differences in collaborative learning could lead to a decrease in productivity; it may cause delays in project deliveries; it may create a bad image for the group; it leads to project failure, and it gives the group a weak competitive edge. From the above findings, it is evident that the cultural background of the students influences their attitudes and values, the knowledge base and the skill set. These in turn influence the classroom behaviours, study habits, the writing styles and their student interactions. Additionally, people’s identity regarding where they were born and raised influences their behaviour and ability to adapt to changes.","michael g. oladokun, clinton o. aigbavboa and mokgadi d. kgoadi sustainable human settlement and construction research centre, faculty of engineering and the built environment, university of johannesburg, republic of south africa michael.oladokun@gmail.com, caigbavboa@uj.ac.za",

374,Development Of Regression Model For Visual Discomfort In  Building Spaces: An Experimental Study,"visual comfort is an important parameter for evaluation of existing building spaces and for designing of buildings to be constructed. any indoor environment is not comfortable or satisfactory if the illumination is poor. in this paper the authors have analyzed the data collected through experiments performed in various illumination settings in laboratory. measured and calculated values of illumination level, position index, unified glare rating (ugr) along with user based survey was used to perform regression analysis. the analysis was used to develop relationships between ugr and illumination level with discomfort experienced by the users in same individual visual setting. the significance of discomfort glare along with illumination level in evaluation of building spaces has been discussed.","illumination, buildings, visual discomfort","The experimental study which was conducted was to mainly emphasize on the importance of light positioning and glare in user comfort in any type of building space. The subjective data which was based on visual discomfort, revealed that illumination levels are not solely responsible in comforting the users but glare and positioning of light source according to the background luminance plays a vital role too. Through the regression analysis of measured and collected data for eighteen experiments based on different settings of illumination levels, light source type and different positions, following conclusions were stated:  Higher UGR results in increased visual discomfort for users and an effort to optimize the UGR or glare should be made in order to achieve maximum visual satisfaction of the users in building spaces.  Irrespective of the optimum illumination level the users may experience discomfort due to poor positioning of the light source.  Solely UGR or Illumination levels are not responsible for visual discomfort.  In order to evaluate the visual discomfort/comfort in building spaces, glare should also be considered along with optimum illumination levels.  The relationships developed through regression analysis may further be used to evaluate and provide scoring for building spaces in context of visual comfort/discomfort due to illumination and glare.

The ergonomic aspect of visual comfort cannot be overlooked and the discomfort glare along with other physical parameters might contribute towards overall assessment of comfort in indoor spaces.","deevesh sharma department of mechanical engineering malaviya national institute of technology jaipur jaipur, india deevesh.sharma@gmail.com awadhesh kumar department of mechanical engineering malaviya national institute of technology jaipur jaipur, india akbhardwaj.mech@mnit.ac.in monica sharma department of management studies malaviya national institute of technology jaipur jaipur, india msharma.dms@mnit.ac.in",
375,An Environmental Concrete With Algerian Concrete,"materials called very fine aggregate or filler may affect the performance of concrete in an either positive or a negative way. discussions on aggregate containing very fine material are vitally important. the goal of the study was to determine how the content of filler might affect properties of concrete. the effect of applying different amounts of filler on concrete was then determined. an experimental approach developed a building product consisting mainly of limestone dust, which is considered as waste or by product material of aggregates industry. the majority of abandoned limestone powder wastes (lpw) is accumulated from the countries all over the world and causes certain serious environmental problems and health hazards. this paper presents a parametric experimental study which investigates the potential use of lpw combination for producing a low-cost and lightweight composite as a building material. the results of investigations on the suitability of using limestone dust as aggregate in lightweight aggregate concrete (lwac) production are reported. in this way, different amounts of limestone dust were used. some of the physical and mechanical properties of concrete mixes having high level of lpw are investigated. the obtained compressive strength, flexural strength and unit weight satisfy the relevant international standards.","waste, environmental, limestone dust","This paper demonstrates how the use technology can transform the cause of social and environmental disaster into a natural resource and, hence, can be used in the post disaster rehabilitation construction projects. It is confirmed that limestone can be used as a resource in concrete production and can be used in low cost construction especially in seismic zones. This experimental work showed that limestone can be used for the production of concrete with acceptable mechanical properties. However the complete investigation of limestone concrete, should include further tests concerning mainly with their durability. To investigate the utilization of limestone dust for the production of high strength building products, like concrete paving blocks, new specimens with higher cement content must be prepared and tested. Also the use of other types of cements, like cements with high Blaine value, may be investigated. 2821","saida kitouni department of process engineering constantine 3 university constantine, algeria souad0714@yahoo.fr","References

However, the industry will start to implement BIM as they saw the benefits that BIM will offer in construction projects. Furthermore, this research found out that the barriers of implementation of BIM at the moment is cost, training, and resistant to change. Based on this research, BIM need to be expose more to Malaysian construction industry. More future research should be done and focus on Malaysian construction to help benefit the industry. Furthermore, maybe the industry can evaluate the differences of using BIM and traditional method in construction project. The researchers can help to develop a framework for the implementation of BIM that will be suitable for the local construction industry by referring to the successful implementation in other countries.

379,Industrial Engineering Education Field In Colombia,"this paper analyze the professors narratives of different industrial engineering programs in colombia, seeking to answer research question about the characteristics of configuration processes and transformation of industrial engineering education in the country, the methodology used was bourdieu’s fields, from the habitus concept of professors while they are the education’s field agents. the study was approached from the analysis of social practices, in which more than mass events of a structural nature, it seeks to strengthen the collective memory of those who have been excluded from official history and serve as an educational space from study of processes and events that led to formation of social subjects, investigating the interaction and conflicts, in such a way that the past can be questioned according to current emancipatory projects. the configuration and transformation processes of industrial engineering as a knowledge discipline in colombia between 1950 and 2000 were studied through the tensions and ruptures, the conflicts and new interactions generated from the developed world discourses. critical analysis was considered as the best alternative in information treatment, because it facilitated the professors’ narratives analysis. for processing information it was utilized qda (qualitative data analysis) y gephi (graph visualisation and cartography in data mining).",about 1950,"With the configuration of the socialist bloc in world, after the second post-war period and the danger that for United States, as the nearest world power country, represented that this ideology was spread in Latin American countries, several studies and projects of cooperation and promotion to the industry were promoted. Education in technical and technological areas such as the Currie Study in 1951 ""Bases of a promotion program for Colombia"" and Atcon's basic plan on the Latin American university in 1961, favouring the emergence and demand of careers such as industrial engineering in the country. The emergence moment of education field in industrial engineering was marked by the influence of these reports. With communism fall in the world in 1989, the interests of United States to contain its proliferation in the underdeveloped countries through the policies of protection to imports and boost local industry (Mission Currie and Alliance for Progress), were untimely changed by the (Washington Consensus) promulgated now by the total opening of these economies, towards a completely globalized international market, devastating almost completely the local industry and forcing the education sector to further diversify and self-manage; so that, industrial engineers who were previously trained to run large companies or act as employees in them, now, they become trained to act as small entrepreneurs or independent consultants in the new neoliberal paradigm of globalization. The teachers' speeches are also updated in the same way. The central nucleus of industrial engineering professor’s habitus is composed mainly of a high symbolic and abstract reality content, in what could be called a capacity for mathematical modelling, predictive and prescriptive, which is used to build their stories and which converts in social capital to perform in the field. This capacity for modelling leads him to perceive the world only from its commensurable dimension, always susceptible to being improved and standardized, reducing its possibilities for analysis and critical reflection. Based on the interviews carried out, it is easily discernible how the teachers of the most recent generations give themselves more and more and without any reflection to the demands imposed on them by the university system to be able to stay in it, without opposing any resistance preventing it from arising a guild conscience and overshadowing any attempt at cohesion, each one works individually to meet academic standards, only meets with colleagues for the same purpose, is not interested in appropriating spaces for construction or deconstruction of the knowledge taught. Older and retired teachers are those who have greater capacity for reflection about their work, however, there are no institutional mechanisms to be heard and taken into account their assessments and recommendations within the universities. There are stories that show, that it would be better in this moment of global crisis, to speak of deindustrialization, and to speak rather of a humanization of the processes. The deindustrialization notion of productive processes and the return to more traditional modes of production, presented by one of the professors, where manual labour prevails and not mass production, is an interesting alternative for the deconstruction of developmental and globalization paradigms that characterize the current economic sector, which among others has relegated our economies to stop being producers to be outsourcing (our economy is concentrated in a precarious tertiary sector and in a high degree of informality of trade and services, because there is not industry). It is constituted in another fissure or point of break that could motivate new speeches for the professors of industrial engineering education field. 2860","luisa fernanda rodríguez valbuena unité mixte de recherche education, formation, travail, savoirs école doctorale clesco - université toulouse jean jaurès luisafrv@gmail.com","References

387,Comparison Of Pension Fund Calculations Using Actuarial  Methods Of Projected Unit Credit And Pay-As-You-Go,"pension fund is an alternative option in providing old-age insurance for employees who do not work anymore due to the expired working age limit, by way of planning periodic payments called pension benefits. one of the factors affecting the pension fund is the amount of basic salary of the last month and years of service. this study discusses the computation of pension fund using projected unit credit and pay-as-you-go method on the data of insurance company ""abc"". the method used herein is to calculate the retirement benefits earned by participants after entering the retirement age, and the amount of the normal contribution to be paid by the participants of the pension plan and the actuarial liability to be paid by the company. the results show that the calculation of pension benefits and normal contributions using the projected unit credit method is more profitable for the employees because of the same fee as the pay- as-you-go method, but the pension benefits received by the retired participants are greater.",pension funds,"In this paper has been discussed about comparing the calculation of pension funds using the projected unit credit and pay-as-you-go method on the data of the Insurance Company ""ABC"". Based on the calculation of the data used, it can be put forward some conclusions as follows. The calculation of pension funds in this study uses the assumption of the last salary with the rate of increase in salary ͳͲ% and interest rates of ʹ ଵ ଶ%. In addition, it is assumed that a person is calculated to be a retirement participant at the age 𝑒= ʹͷ years and retire at age 𝑟= ͷ͸ year. Based on the graph in Figure 1, the amount of retirement benefits obtained using the projected unit credit method is greater than the pay-as-you-go method. Based on the graph in Figure 2, the amount of normal dues to be paid by the participants using the projected unit credit method is similar to the pay-as-you-go. Based on the graph in Figure 3, the amount actuarial liabilities to be paid by the company using the projected unit credit is much larger than the pay- as-you-go method. The projected unit credit method is more profitable for the employee than the pay-as-you-go method, since the pension benefits received are greater, even though the normal contributions paid by pension participants are almost the same.

Traffic signals are used to solve conflict between traffic streams at an intersection and signal groups are used to control traffic streams by different light indications which provides an optimal solution to the control problem. Here we have considered an example of a traffic control problem with two different solutions. In the first case the conflicting streams are not allowed to move simultaneously while in the second case left turn of the conflicting traffic streams are allowed. In terms of accomodating more number of traffic streams in the signal groups, it is found that the solution of the second case is a better one compared to the first case. Finally, it is to be noted that different choice of signal groups e.g. ܵଵ, ܵଶ, ܵଷ and ܵସ of the example will give different solutions of the problem.

393,Determining The Numbers Of Time Series Observation     For Rice Crisis Forecasting,"an objective visibility analysis has been developed as an integral part of the research ""identifying indicators for rice crisis forecasting in asia"". analysis of visibility is a topic that received less attention in the study of forecasting models. yet without a visibility analysis predicted results would be questionable whether the forecasting results can still be trusted. analysis of visibility is required for assessing the ability of a model to forecast future events. in this paper we introduce visibility error which has different concept from the definition of error obtained during model building. visibility error is the forecasting performance statistic which is needed as base in determining how long period of forecasting can be done. without this statistics the forecaster can predict the next thousand years without clear statistical reasoning. specifically this study developed error time variant visibility using inductive logic. one important finding raised in this paper is a formula for determining the numbers of data testing required to perform forecasting work based on specific forecasting specifications. the formula is: n = v + 2.","visibility, error visibility, forecasting, (hidayat","Based on the above result of the induction process has been obtained a new technique to decide the validity period of a forecasting method. Forecaster cannot do forecasting without knowing the statistics forecasting performance of a forecasting model. Please note, forecasting performance statistics is only a necessary condition and not a sufficient requirement to know the substance of prediction accuracy. One important finding of this framework is that we now have a formula for determining how much data testing is required to perform forecasting work based on specific forecasting specific lengths. The formula is: N = V + 2, where N = Number of test data required, and V = visibility or validity period. According to the formula we need N=3 to obtain one step ahead forecast or one validity period. We need 5 data test to get three steps ahead forecasting.

394,"Integration Of Quality, Health & Safety, Environment And Social  Accountability Under A Single Management System","the aim of this paper is to integrate quality, health & safety, environmental and social accountability standards under a comprehensive management system. to attain a specific function these compliance standards have been expanded separately at different occasions. handling with these individual management systems and confirming their in-line position with organizational business objective are always found difficult. the current situation has accelerated the demand for integrating individual management standards in conjunction with business objectives of the organizations. a holistic tqm approach can effectively consolidate the existing quality, health & safety, social accountability and environmental operations into an indivisible and cross-functional management system. to some extent, the current management standards are treated as a subgroup of tqm. the benefits of such fusion exceed the sum of fractional benefits of individually handled management systems. the synthesis does not intend combining a few management standards conjointly, rather it means projecting the several disciplines in unique management standard based on their cross- functional inter connections. actually, it is analytical in nature on the basis of the compliance criteria of ohsas 18001, iso 9001, iso 14001 and sa 8000. the main finding of this study concludes that, integration is feasible based on their philosophical analogies between tqm and other management standards. this paper will contribute in the way that, it establishes a model of integrated management system accompanying its implementation instructions in connection with tqm.","tqm, qm","Industrial firms have already realized that, they need to create their products with good quality under safety environment and better working condition. It is essential because it will ensure sustainability of the firm in the competitive global market and associated diversification of customer requirements. Consequently, assimilation of several management standards is very much obligatory. Management sub-systems like quality, health & safety, social accountability go hand-in-hand with each other. For example, the primary aspect of improving product quality is to increase the productivity. On the other hand, the main reasons for protection of environment are to ensure quality of life inside and outside the company and improvement of company’s public image. Quality of life inside the company means creating safe and secure working condition for the employees. It will eliminate or minimize risk to worker, increase the moral of the employees and reduce the rate of absenteeism due to occupational disease. This would also increase employee’s eagerness to improve their quality of work. Several authors (Khan, 2006; Pojasek, 2006; Jorgensen et al., 2006; Beckmerhageniet al., 2003; Vrassidas et al., 2010) have presented their approach for efficient integration of different management sub-systems in terms of their compatibilities. But the main finding of this paper highlights that, compatibilities among the sub- management systems alone cannot ensure the sustainability of an integrated management system in the global market. Total integration may not be feasible without understanding the interrelationships among these management systems in terms of their cross -functional competence. So, alignment of these sub-systems under the broad conceptual management can further increase the scope of integration. The wider scope of integration will not only ensure the compatibilities among the sub-systems, but also ensure their cross-functional competence. In this regard, TQM has an ability to accumulate all cross-functional activities in an organization. Therefore, the philosophical similarities between TQM and proposed management system will ensure complete integration. According to Rasmussen (2007), there is not a single international standard for IMS. The process of developing IMS on the basis of national standards is still in progress. Progressive integration of different management systems is a common practice in today’s competitive market. Requirements of different systems vary in terms of their scope, control, monitoring, and follow up actions. So, opportunities of integration on the basis their commonalities decreases with the increase number of function specific management systems. Therefore, degree of compatibility in case of multiple management systems is a major limitation of this model. In this circumstance, the author suggests integration under the common philosophy of a wider management system will be the best strategy. It is possible to develop an integrated management system on the basis of the similarities found in different management system. Nevertheless, the philosophical similarities between TQM and other management systems have not been tested empirically. It should be given emphasis in the future studies on identification of some other philosophical similarities between TQM and other management systems. It will be helpful to make an integrated management system more reliable.","subratatalapatra department of industrial engineering and management khulna university of engineering & technology, khulna-9203, bangladesh sub_ksy@yahoo.com md. kutubuddin department of mechanical engineering khulna university of engineering & technology, khulna-9203, bangladesh kutub_bitk@yahoo.com",

397,Overall Efficiency Improvement Of A Production Line By  Using Yamazumi Chart: A Case Study,"this paper presents a case study aims to redesign a hand bag assembly line to reach maximum line efficiency with an optimum number of workstation for a constant cycle time. three heuristic assembly line balancing algorithms known as “kilbridge and wester column”, “rank positional weight” and “largest candidate rule” are applied to design this single model assembly line. yamazumi chart is used to the visual representation of workload on each workstation. best two solution models are then simulated in arena to check the feasibility. by comparing analytical and simulation report one best solution model is recommended to implement. the evaluation of the proposed solution model shows that the production line efficiency increased from 49 percent to 77 percent, number of manpower reduced from 23 workers to 16 workers and provides more balanced workload on each worker. therefore, this paper can contribute to meet the same amount of customer demand with a minimized operator cost by higher utilization of worker.","line balancing, yamazumi chart, simulation, arena","The efficiency is of the two solution model is empirically same. Although, in real life, the efficiency is slightly lower as practical conditions are variable and unpredictable. The limitation of implementing these solution model multi-skilled worker is highly required. So recruiting multi-skilled worker is recommended to a workstation when implement KWC solution model.","subrata talapatra department of industrial engineering and management khulna university of engineering and technology khulna 9203, bangladesh sub_ksy@yahoo.com sharif-al-mahmud department of industrial engineering and management khulna university of engineering and technology khulna 9203, bangladesh sharif8415@gmail.com imran kabir department of industrial engineering and management khulna university of engineering and technology khulna 9203, bangladesh shantokuet50@gmail.com",

399,Assessing The Corporate Obligation Of Proactive  Procurement Of Business Services,"proactive service procurement is a highly sensitive and risk prone phenomena due to being intangible in nature that requires innovative design-thinking approach by the suppliers and mutually comprehensible and acceptable by the buyers to ensure long term success and profitability of both the parties involved process. services are affected by various factors, which should be taken into serious consideration while designing the process of service procurement. this paper, throws light on multi-factor proactive service design and its procurement process which helps in comprehending the critical nature and the significance of designing fool proof proactive service procurement framework to strengthen corporate risk management mechanism to ensure long term effective buyer supplier relationship. the study sample was taken from three european medium range enterprises engaged in energy sector businesses i.e., mechanical and electrical products and service suppliers. the study findings highlight the multi-factor and critical nature of service offerings and its procurement procedures to suggest the serious requirement of installing systematic mechanism by the service industries to protect the interests of both buyers and suppliers through designing proactive procurement procedures (i.e., plans and contracts etc.) for services to ensure long term profitable corporate relationships (i.e., buyer and suppliers or business to business etc,). the study results revealed the following as the significant factors to be considered while designing effective proactive procurement procedures of services i.e., making right choices at the first place (lean thinking approach), waste elimination, cost effectiveness, speedy and intelligent procurement. customer‘s profound satisfaction, competitive edge or advantage. this study provides real time corporate experiences and examples from the european medium range industries to demonstrate the utility and authenticity of the research findings and will therefore contribute in future, through result implementation while designing complex frameworks to strengthen and support the operations of proactive procurement of services.","design-thinking, multi-factor, value chain, lean thinking","This study has offered investigative findings to unearth the modern industrial practices and trends of “service procurement” by the manufacturing companies, in addition to the ways through which the current service procurement concept facilitates the proactive business practices, on the basis of lean thinking as well as the innovative tools and methods by the modern day’s Industrial sector. The above referred facts, consequently, generated the need of strengthening the techniques like, well defined and carefully designed “service purchase orders” dully supported by smartly worded service procurement contracts. During workshop discussions with the key state holders of almost all the companies, it was revealed that the service business is still to be established as a separate entity from the tangible products of the companies. In addition, the representatives of all the target companies, agreed on the significance of outsourcing the services through the service providers and developing strong internal systems for the procurement of “business services” to avoid huge costs by wrong specifications and faulty ordering by installing proactive procurement procedures mainly through expert brainstorming and authoring fool proof contracting to ensure effective, profitable and long-term corporate relationship between the buyer and supplier of services. .
