In this paper, we develop an algorithm to perform simulations in which we randomly allocate quantities from suppliers and fulfil them through randomly selected aggregators. The truck costs and aggregator fixed and variable costs, in addition to the transportation distance between the supplier/aggregator and aggregator/demand centers allow us to compute the Total supply chain cost for each simulation. The minimal supply chain cost across simulations is the sourcing strategy, which is given for n = 1000 simulations as below, as an example in Table 13 below. It is noteworthy that no two simulation runs are likely to give the same minimal total cost, even when n is held the same (example, n = 1,000) Table 13.

The application of tools such as standardized work, the 5S methodology, and the Kanban system significantly reduced operational times and improved inventory management efficiency. Specifically, a 47% reduction in picking time, a 41% decrease in product obsolescence, and a 10.78% increase in service level, meeting industry standards, were observed. These results confirm that integrating Lean Manufacturing principles can generate substantial improvements in the competitiveness and sustainability of SMEs in the pharmaceutical sector. The importance of this research lies in its contribution to the knowledge and practice of inventory management in SMEs, a sector that often lacks specific studies. By addressing critical issues such as inefficiency in storage processes and the high rate of product obsolescence, this research provides a framework to optimize operations, improve service quality, and increase profitability. Additionally, it reinforces the idea that SMEs, despite their resource limitations, can significantly benefit from adopting Lean methodologies, enabling them to compete more effectively in a highly regulated and competitive market. The contributions to the field of study are numerous and significant. Firstly, this study expands the application of Lean Manufacturing in a sector that has been historically underexamined. Implementing the Lean model in a pharmaceutical SME not only improves operational efficiency but also provides an adaptable framework that can be used by other companies in similar contexts. Moreover, the results offer empirical evidence that Lean methodologies can be successfully adapted and applied in SMEs, overcoming the specific challenges of such organizations. This study also suggests that adopting tools like Kanban and 5S can improve not only internal efficiency but also customer satisfaction and market positioning. Regarding final observations and suggestions for further study, this work highlights the need for continued research into the application of Lean tools in SMEs within highly regulated sectors, such as the pharmaceutical industry. It is suggested that future studies explore the integration of emerging technologies, such as automation and the Internet of Things (IoT), to further enhance the efficiency and accuracy of inventory management and storage processes. Additionally, it would be beneficial to investigate the long-term impact of Lean model implementation on the sustainability and growth of SMEs, as well as their ability to adapt to changes in demand and market regulations. This call to action encourages researchers to delve deeper into the application of Lean methodologies in SMEs and explore new directions that could contribute to the development of innovative and effective solutions in operations management.","lean storage model for enhancing operational efficiency: a case study of a peruvian pharmaceutical sme yoshan akira yseki-paucar bachelors in industrial engineering facultad de ingeniería, universidad de lima, perú 20123233@aloe.ulima.edu.pe jorge mauricio miller-espejo bachelors in industrial engineering facultad de ingeniería, universidad de lima, perú 20150887@aloe.ulima.edu.pe",

Due to its flexibility for workers, companies have still implemented this setup. However, the rise of WFH workers, especially in the Philippines, contributed to the prevalence of obesity. Obesity is a complex multifactorial disease that accumulates excess body fat and leads to adverse effects on health. Determining the body classification such as obese, body mass index (BMI) is computed. Due to limited movement, many employees or workers engage in insufficient physical activity, leading to obesity. Thus, it is crucial to determine not all but possible leading causes that contribute to obesity. In conclusion, two significant independent variables, namely, work stress and fast food consumption, affect the Work-from-home employees' body mass index (BMI). As observed in the SPSS results, the P-values of these independent variables are 0.034 and 0.021, respectively. A hypothesis test that acquires less than 0.05 entails that it is statistically significant (Bobbitt, 2021). On the other hand, factors like employee satisfaction, cigarette consumption, alcohol intake, and job satisfaction do not contribute to the increase in BMI in the respondents. Given that it has been found in the study that the significant effects that contribute to the obesity of work-from-home employees are the factors of fast-food consumption and work stress, it is recommended that, especially its HR Employee Relations officers to implement policies or create programs that will promote healthy eating habits as well as alleviate work stress—encouraging their employees to participate in several trainings and seminars, as well as supporting/providing healthy choices from respective cafeterias and vending machines. The researchers could further explore different variables that could be affecting the obesity of work-from-home employees.

Using PLS-SEM, the researchers found that Mental Health and Years of Separation significantly impacted the student's academic performance. Mental health affected motivation and interest, while more extended periods of parental separation led to lower academic performance. Contrary to previous studies, MBTI and physical separation alone were insignificant factors. The study also identified mediating variables, with Years of Separation influencing both mental health and MBTI concerning academic outcomes. Relating to B.F. Skinner's Theory of Learning, the study highlighted that mental health and parental separation act as stimuli impacting academic behavior. The analysis showed how mental health issues, such as anxiety from separation, could hinder academic success. Additionally, the study used reliable psychometric measures, such as Cronbach's Alpha, and fit indices like SRMR and NFI, to confirm the validity and accuracy of its findings. The research emphasizes the importance of mental health and prolonged separation in shaping academic outcomes, recommending communication strategies and professional support as key interventions. The study recommends future research to delve deeper into significant factors, explore alternative data collection methods, expand the sample size, and investigate the relationship between parental involvement, children's personality traits, and academic performance.

If the estimated chi-square value is greater than the critical value, we reject the null hypothesis, showing a statistically significant relationship between organizational characteristics and WLB among migrant workers. The predictable χ², stands lesser than the CV, we cannot reject the null hypothesis, indicating that there is no meaningful relationship between the two variables. Based on the chi-square test conducted to analyse the association between organizational factors (such as workplace culture, policies, and support mechanisms) and the WLB of migratory labors in the industrial sector, the following conclusions can be drawn from the data analysis and interpretation: Workplace Culture: The chi-square test results indicate a significant association between workplace culture and the WLB of migratory labors (χ² = [calculated chi- square value]). This suggests that the perceived impact of workplace culture on WLB varies among migrant workers, with a majority indicating either positive or neutral effects. However, a smaller proportion of workers perceive a negative impact of workplace culture on their work-life balance. Policies: The analysis reveals a significant association between organizational policies and the WLB of migrant work ers (χ² = [calculated chi-square value]). This indicates that organizational policies show a part in shaping the WLB knowledges of migrant workers, with varying perceptions among individuals. While some workers view organizational policies positively, others may perceive them as having a neutral or negative impact on their work-life balance. In conclusion, the findings of the chi-square test indicate that organizational factors, including workplace culture, policies, and support mechanisms, have a significant impact on the WLB of migratory labours in the industrial sector. These factors influence the perceived WLB experiences of workers, with insinuations aimed at worker welfare, job satisfaction, and organizational effectiveness. Therefore, it is essential for organizations to recognize the importance of creating supportive work environments and implementing effective policies and practices to enhance the WLB of migratory labour’s and promote overall employee health and productivity.

Findings reveal that adherence to a low-protein, low-sodium lacto-vegetarian diets not only supports better nutritional status but also helps slow CKD progression, reduce muscle wasting, and delay or potentially avoid the need for dialysis. These positive health outcomes also highlight the importance of effective patient education and ongoing dietary counselling to achieve and maintain compliance with prescribed diets. The study provides compelling evidence that a lacto-vegetarian low-protein diet, when followed consistently, can be particularly beneficial for kidney health, improving quality of life and enhancing longevity for CKD patients. These insights lay a foundation for further research into personalized dietary interventions in CKD care, aiming to develop tailored strategies that maximize patient well-being and long-term kidney function through sustainable dietary management.","an anthropometric analysis comparing the effects of very low protein lactovegetarian and omnivorous diets along with keto analogues aparna nemalikanti registered dietician research scholar, best innovation university head quarters gownivaripalli, gorantla, andhra pradesh, india 2023wpfsc001@bestiu.edu.in",

The implementation of standardized work templates and process automation led to a 4.69% reduction in quotation times. Although this improvement is below the industry standard, it represents a meaningful step toward increasing efficiency and enhancing customer experience. The study began with a thorough analysis of the company’s background and the operational challenges within the subscription area. This context was essential for understanding the key factors contributing to delays in the processing of quotation requests. Key problems were identified during the research, particularly the recurring delays caused by the exchange of incomplete information between commercial agents and the subscription area. The introduction of standardized templates helped streamline this process by reducing unnecessary back-and-forth communication. The Lean Six Sigma methodology was applied to develop practical solutions that improve the efficiency of the interaction between commercial agents and the subscription area. This not only reduced disruptions in the workflow but also had a direct impact on enhancing the overall customer experience. Finally, the proposed solution was validated through simulation, demonstrating improvements in both process efficiency and resource utilization. Although the percentage improvement is modest compared to theoretical standards, it signals potential for further enhancement.

Future Work 
Integration with Real-Time Health Tracking: By continuously monitoring the user's health data, the system 
could provide recommendations that adapt in real-time, such as post-workout smoothies that replenish lost 
nutrients or energy-boosting options for users with low activity levels. 
 
Enhanced Customization Features: The system can be expanded to allow users to input more detailed 
preferences, such as specific nutritional goals (e.g., high-protein, low-carb), ingredient dislikes, or dietary 
requirements like gluten-free or lactose-free options. This will ensure that the recommendations are even more 
tailored to meet individual health objectives.

Both species exhibit distinct susceptibility and resistance patterns to various parasites, influenced by their ecological niches, physiological characteristics, and environmental conditions. Fresh water fishes, as a herbivorous fish, is more prone to ectoparasitic infections, particularly from monogeneans like Dactylogyrus and crustaceans such as Argulus. This vulnerability can be attributed to its feeding habits and gill morphology, which provide a conducive environment for ectoparasites. On the other hand, Channa striata, a carnivorous species, often harbors endoparasites like nematodes and trematodes due to its predatory lifestyle and the types of prey it consumes. The proposed integrated management strategies, combining biological controls, environmental management, targeted chemical treatments, and genetic selection, can significantly reduce parasitic loads in both species. Implementing these strategies will not only enhance fish health and growth but also improve the sustainability of aquaculture practices.","ecto and endo parasite comparison of catla catla and channa striata species found in kurnool district, andhra pradesh, india bandapalli sujatha bharatiya engineering science and technology innovation university, anantapur, andhra pradesh – 515231, india department of zoology, kvrgcw (a), cluster university, kurnool district, andhra pradesh – 518 003, india dr. m. rajashekar associate professor, dept of zoology, palamuru university mahabubnagar district, telangana, india",

The second preprocessing step was further enhanced by using general stop words and spam-specific stop words to bring an increase in the model performance in classifying spam and non-spam emails. This helps the system realize that the text data is sequential, improving classification accuracy as an LSTM model. It is accurate and balances precision and recall, thereby reducing false positives and negatives. This renders a robust spam detection system that can be deployed for real-time classification of emails to ensure a cleaner and more secure inbox experience for users.

FDM technology, however, allows the obtaining of unique individual elements with satisfactory properties and, in the case of personal 3D printers, also an acceptable price. Problems with the quality of 3D printing stems mostly from changing of environmental conditions, the required high accuracy calibration of a printer (especially the build table leveling), that is a necessary condition for obtaining proper adhesion of the first layer to the table. In order to obtain correct, non-deformed prints from some materials (PLA), direct cooling of the printed item is also necessary. The Effect of FDM process parameters of layer thickness, volume infill and print speed of PLA material was first systematically investigated in this study and also tensile test was performed. The results indicated that the optimal combination of tensile strength is layer thickness of 0.2-0.25mm, volume infill of 50-75%, and print speed of 18-20mm/sec. From this set of combinations the optimum tensile strength is obtained as 20-25 MPa.","review of printing parameters on mechanical properties in fdm 3d printing process pundru bhavana, vangari saikiran, ghanathe varshith and pakala manikanta department of mechanical engineering b v raju institute of technology, india bhavanapundru@gamil.com, saikiranvangari28@gmail.com, varshithghanathe@gmail.com, pakalamanikanta061@gmail.com dr. v. murali krishna, dr. r. muthalagu professor and dean of academics, asistant professor department of mechanical engineering b v raju institute of technolog, telangana narsapur, medak,telangana, india",

Proper project selection, complexity evaluation, alternative problem- solving methods, and timely implementation are crucial elements that must be carefully evaluated to ensure the success of LSS initiatives. Firstly, proper project selection is critical. LSS projects should be aligned with organizational goals and objectives, and should address significant pain points or opportunities for improvement. Projects that are too small or too simple may not be the best candidates for LSS, as the methodology may be overkill. On the other hand, projects that are too complex may require additional resources and expertise. Secondly, complexity evaluation is essential. LSS projects should be evaluated based on their complexity, and the appropriate tools and methodologies should be applied. For example, simple projects may require only basic problem- solving tools, while more complex projects may require advanced statistical analysis and modeling. Thirdly, alternative problem-solving methods should be considered. LSS is not the only methodology available, and other approaches such as Kaizen, Total Productive Maintenance (TPM), and Theory of Constraints (TOC) may be more appropriate in certain situations. Fourthly, timely implementation is crucial. LSS projects should be implemented in a timely manner, with clear milestones and deadlines. Delays can lead to loss of momentum, and can undermine the success of the project. Finally, a thoughtful and strategic approach to LSS implementation is essential. Organizations should carefully evaluate their readiness for LSS, and should develop a clear implementation plan that aligns with their goals and objectives. This includes developing the necessary infrastructure, training and developing personnel, and establishing clear metrics and benchmarks. By acknowledging these factors and adopting a judicious approach, organizations can harness the full potential of LSS to drive operational excellence, enhance efficiency, and achieve sustainable improvements. LSS can help organizations reduce waste, improve quality, and increase customer satisfaction, leading to increased competitiveness and long-term success.","operational excellence through lean six sigma: strategies and best practices alluri hema saiesha, v.pranay chandra and aakash sreeraj student, department of mechanical engineering, b v raju institute of technology narsapur 502313, telangana, india mechiri sandeep kumar associate professor, department of mechanical engineering, b v raju institute of technology narsapur 502313, telangana, india",

Coal processing being labour intensive jobs are normally considered to pose musculoskeletal risks over long time. But, with increasing automation and dependence over technology, workers are expected to perform more number of activities which are less of physical nature. These changed natures of jobs are also impacting mental health. So, considering other human factors along with physical one is necessary for coal processing and other related plants for better assessment of workers’ overall health. Industries are focusing on overall health of workers to mitigate, reduce the risks and their impacts to remain productive, competitive and many a times statutory compliant.","risk assessment of coal processing plant: an ergonomic perspective rohit gupta indian institute of management sambalpur, india rohitism12@gmail.com",

The maximum effectiveness observed in Parallel flow Heat exchanger with nanofluid usage is found to be 42.5% for 1% vol. concentration and in counter Counter flow Heat exchanger is found to be 50% for 1% vol. concentration of nanofluid. Heat transfer is found to increase with increase in volume concentration up to 0.8% and then decreases for both Parallel and Counter flow Heat exchanger.The maximum value of U that is obtained at 0.8% volume concentration in parallel flow is 646 w/m2K and in counter flow is 653 W/m2K. Optimum performance of heat exchanger is thus obtained at 0.8% volume concentration of CuO nanofluid in Counter flow arrangement with an effectiveness of 49.03 % .Addition of CuO nanoparticles in right amount can thus improve the heat transfer coefficient, thermal conductivity as well as effectiveness of heat exchanger.Prandtl Number is found to decrease from a value of 5.55 for zero concentrated base fluid to a value of 0.028 due to increase in nanofluid concentration indicating free flowing behavior of fluid with high thermal conductivity. 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 Overall Heat Transfer Coefficient (W/m^2 K) Heat transfer fluid concentration (%) Overall Heat transfer in Parallel Flow (Comparison) Experimental Results 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 Overall Heat Transfer Coefficient (W/m^2 K) Heat Transfer Fluid Concentration (%) Overall Heat Transfer in Counter flow Experimental Results CFD Results 614","structural and cfd analysis of concentric tube heat exchanger using cuo nanofluid dr ishrat m. mirzana professor, department of mechanical engineering mufakham jah college of engineering and technology, hyderabad director, ewb-india ishrat.mirzana@gmail.com zuriah department of mechanical engineering mufakham jah college of engineering and technology, hyderabad zuriahsyed96@gmail.com","References

74,4Th Indian International Conference On Industrial Engineering And Operations Management  Doi: 10.46254/In04.20240144,"office space design and its importance is increasing with the average hours spent at work and as the nature of work is becoming more sedentary especially in knowledge sectors. ergonomics is one of the key elements in the design of offices that have an immense direct effect on the health and wellbeing of employees. our study is to understand this element of workstations set up at homes and offices that employees in india are using in the present scenario. we found that employees working from home faced health issues due to inappropriate setup at home and made changes to the same later and also to the working style by adding more movement during work. employees working in office setup report that new elements such as sit/stand desks, bigger screens can aid them to be happier at work. 1. introduction historically, the nature of work in the services industry has seen a sea of change post world war especially with the continuous evolution of technology, but the desk based office design has not changed much. this landscape is made complex further post covid-19 where employees were forced to work from home (wfh) and when organizations shifted to hybrid mode thereafter. the relation between office spaces and work shifted to working two-three days in offices and rest at home. wfh is here to stay since the next generation job seekers also value the option of working at the convenience of home (beyond the paycheck, jobseekers value ’work flexibility’: survey, 2023) (mint). employees also see wfh appropriate because of reduced commute hours, convenience of home (davis et al., 2020). but it is also a passive concern that these spaces at home are not enabled and built to spend time working for long hours. as the number of hours employees have increased drastically, the need to equip employees better is an important challenge and concern for organisations. the well-being of employees is dependent on health which in a way is related to ergonomics especially in the knowledge sector with demanding work. who defines health as , “a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity” (bickenbach, 2017). ergonomics is a match between job type and the working setup which includes tools so that one is able to work efficiently (c. edwards et al., 2024). the goal of a good ergonomic design is to avoid musculoskeletal, joint and other 638",,"and limitations Employees in our study lived in urban setups and rented/ owned spaces such as 1BHK and 2BHK. Real Estate is a major constraint for people in urban places given them space and financial burden it can exert. We need to look at ergonomics from this constraint which is a major bottleneck to address. Designers and Furniture companies need to look at this limitation and make equipment which are mobile, less space demanding and flexible. Organisations should make the ergonomic elements a priority according to the job profile and number of hours spent in offices for wellbeing and for long term health and well-being of employees. Our study involves working with only IT and ITeS employees majorly. The objective was to present key trends in their perceptions and hence a qualitative approach was adapted. To arrive at the significance of different factors, requires larger sample sizes, specifically looking for particular elements. This can be done with vast sample sizes to generalize the results and can be potential topics of future research. 644","ergonomics and wellbeing: a study on employees-in-office and employees working from home in india keerthi krd research scholar vinod gupta school of management, indian institute of technology kharagpur, west bengal, india krd.keerthi@iitkgp.ac.in dr. susmita mukhopadhyay associate professor vinod gupta school of management indian institute of technology kharagpur, west bengal, india susmita@vgsom.iitkgp.ac.in","References

""optimal workplace and process parameters"" refers to the most effective mix of elements within a workplace that enhances productivity, work quality, employee satisfaction, and overall performance while minimizing resource wastage. this study aims to identify the ideal balance and alignment between workplace and process elements by investigating and determining the optimal workplace and process parameters for creating a conducive work environment in a small-scale tailoring unit. the study utilizes taguchi's orthogonal array (oa) method by selecting 4 control factors at 3 levels, which include illuminance, type of needle, type of fabric, and type of sewing machine. the response variable chosen to assess the impact of these parameters was the daily average units of garments produced per week. an l9 orthogonal array was designed using statistical software, and the array was analyzed using signal-to-noise (s/n) ratio equations based on larger-the-better condition. the control factors and their levels corresponding to the highest s/n ratio value determine the small-scale tailoring unit's optimal workplace and process parameters. the obtained optimal control factors and their levels were workplace illuminance-755 lux, type of needle-sharp needle, type of fabric-polyester and type of sewing machine-flatlock sewing machine. this combination of factors will be the optimal parameter for maximizing the response variable chosen and these parameters define the overall performance of the tailoring unit.","optimal parameters, s/n ratio","The optimal level of workplace and process parameters of a small-scale tailoring unit were determined using Taguchi's orthogonal array method. The optimal factors were determined based on the higher values of the S/N ratios for each control factor level. The obtained results were validated and verified. The combination of factors with the highest S/N ratio will be the optimal parameter for maximizing the response variable in the small-scale tailoring unit. The most significant control factor that significantly influences the response variable is the one that has the lowest delta value and lowest ranking. The obtained optimal workplace and process parameters were compared with similar research works that were based on the determination of optimal parameters in a working environment. On comparing the results of this study with similar works discussed in the literature review, it can be concluded that the results were in accordance with the Taguchi methodology and the obtained S/N ratios had a major significance on the variability occurring in the operations of the particular industry under consideration, which determines the significance and influence of the determined control factors on the response variable under consideration. From the concepts obtained from the literature review, the significance of the factors was determined based on their delta values and ranking values. From the obtained response table for Signal-to-Noise ratios, the lowest delta value was 0.39 with a ranking of 4 and the highest delta value was 1.37 with a ranking of 1. The factor corresponding to the lowest delta was the type of needle used and it is considered as the most significant factor that influences the sewing operation. The Taguchi methodology can be implemented for comparing the significance of factors among various operations within the same industry or can be used to compare the factors of two different industries.

Therefore, it can be rightfully noted that, in terms of designing and optimizing the blades and rotors for quite a number of the wind turbines, the QBlade software is among the most valuable. As presented in this work the results are very encouraging especially for placing SAM in crowded fields primarily due to the smaller swept area of the turbine. Thus, future works including the non-linearity, skew, pre-cone, and tower may validate the selected design to be analyzed. A good candidate was designed to hit crowded places with minimal sound volume and relative lesser pollution levels than the usual wind turbines. Local modifications of the airfoil geometry are suggested to enhance the capabilities of simulations. The exponent of 2 only from Peukert’s work is accurate at high tip-speed-ratio, precise, and only limits the maximum power which can be delivered, while not lowering the efficiency of the wind turbine.","analyzing the blade element momentum technique for small horizontal wind turbines with a 3m blade diameter and 2kw power output raheem alhamdawee research scholar, mechanical engineering department jawaharlal nehru technological university hyderabad, telangana, india radoow@gmail.com m. manzoor hussain sr. professor in mechanical engineering jawaharlal nehru technological university hyderabad telangana, india manzoorjntu@gmail.com k. phani raja kumar former sr. manager, tech mahindra americas, usa dr.phanikaturu@gmail.com",
