0,Sustainability Framework For Farm Level Cotton Supply  Chain Management,"in agricultural products, cotton is a cash crop for farmers. cotton is environmentally a highly sensitive crop and is under risk from the effects of global warming and the intensive use of synthetic inputs. due to global warming and climate change, the production of cotton is shrinking in the world’s largest cotton producing countries such as china, india, usa and pakistan. in the overall cotton supply chain management (cscm) system, immediate sustainable measures are required for protecting the textile industry and the livelihoods of cotton industry stakeholders. based on a thorough review of the literature, a cotton supply chain management cycle at both the farm level, and the industry overall, was developed in this study. a sustainable cotton supply chain management framework (cscmf) is developed in this study for farm level production by identifying the critical success factors (csf’s) in the literature review, with subsequent interviews with six technical experts who were experienced in small, medium, and large farming enterprises, categorised under the headings of sustainability, supply chain management and cotton farming. the csfs identified were classified in terms of cotton supply chain management under the three sustainability pillars of social, economic and environmental sustainability. this cscm framework will be useful to inform the future development of sustainability policies, and the assessment of farmers’ behavior, regarding sustainable practices",,"Cotton production sustainability is a serious challenge for developing countries such as India and Pakistan. Through different campaigns and serious United Nations (UN) programs, many countries, and industries, are collectively putting their efforts into the achievement of sustainability in every field of life. The agriculture sector is the most concerning and most directly affected industry, and requires serious attention to sustainability and sustainable practices. Cotton production is one of the most unsustainable agricultural industries due to the normal practices for heavy use of insecticides and pesticides, and the poor knowledge of small farmers of sustainable practices. To overcome these problems, social development programs by Non-government organizations (NGO’s) have acknowledged the importance of sustainable cotton production and they are endeavoring to expand sustainable practices through foreign and domestic stakeholders like BCI. By developing a model of the social, economic and environmental sustainability paradigms, recognizing the Critical Success Factors essential in the farm level cotton supply chain, we are confident that this model can inform government policy and assist farm level stakeholders to achieve sustainable production practices. It must be acknowledged that the success of this model of sustainability depends on farmers’ behavior and acceptance. Farmer awareness, level of education, attitude to risk, size of farms and other relevant matters must be explored and understood, and a government sustainability policy framework developed, to fulfil the growing demand of sustainable cotton production. Our model provides a basis for such policies and practices. 6.","sonia nazeer and puwanart fuggate school of logistic and supply chain naresuan university phitsanulok, thailand. e-mail: mrssoniashafiq@gmail.com e-mail: puwanartfuggate@gmail.com",
1,Cost Oriented Failure Consequence Analysis Of Machine  Componentsa Case Study,"failure mode and effect analysis (fmea) is a methodology used for product and process design, by identifying the potential failure modes and prioritizing them, subsequently reduce the error in the process. the failure consequence is quantified in terms of risk priority number (rpn), a product of occurrence, severity, and detection difficulty. this approach to fmea lacks the quantification of costs of potential occurrence of specified failure modes and costs of their analysis. in manufacturing, the rpn measurement provides little or no meaning as the failure quantification on the basis of cost may be more meaningful. this paper describes the modification to the methodology of fmea process in a cost-oriented manner, which takes into account the economic aspects of potential failure of the machine component. three consequences of the failure of components are considered; failure will result in conditions where machine is immediately stopped (f1), leads to reduction in speed (f2) and affecting product quality (f3). expected annual cost index based on the failure consequence is calculated to identify the criticality of the components. an application of the cost oriented fmea is presented for a press machine manufacturing auto components.","fmea, cost basis",,"pratik nandanwar department of industrial engineering, shri ramdeobaba college of engineering & management, nagpur, india dr. pravin p. tambe* department of industrial engineering, shri ramdeobaba college of engineering & management, nagpur, india tambep@rknec.edu, tambepp@gmail.com",
2,Managing Production And Sales Of Refurbished Products  Under Capacity Limitations,"with the launch of e-commerce, market has experienced steady surge in consumer durables but it has shortened product life cycle due to rapid changes in features and capabilities. refurbished items can generate additional revenue for the company while two major drawbacks could be, first, reduced future demand for the newer products and second capacity limitations of the manufacturers. manufacturers always have inventory holding and sales constraints and additional accumulating inventory of returned product can be difficult to carry over to next periods. this creates a problem of optimal launch of refurbished products to effectively use the capacity limitation without influencing the sales of newly launched products. we propose to formulate an optimization model to find market launch time of refurbished products constrained over profit and capacity by three steps. first an analysis of the time series distribution is done to depict its influence over sales. secondly, using bass diffusion model as a base form for the sales distribution a convolution of sales curve is presented stating the time and capacity at which the refurbished products needs to be released into the market. finally, a forecasting method is presented to determine the inventory holding capacity at instantaneous time depending on the market demand.","life cycle, remanufacturing",,"mayukh saha, vaibhav agrawal department of industrial and systems engineering indian institute of technology kharagpur 721302, west bengal, india maykat1995@gmail.com, vaibhavagrawal.iitkgp@gmail.com, dr. akhilesh kumar department of industrial and systems engineering indian institute of technology kharagpur 721302, west bengal, india akumar@iem.iitkgp.ac.in",
3,Location Model Minimizing Distances Between  Ev Charging Stations,"in cooperation with the recent prevalence of electric vehicles (evs), researches focus on location planning for ev charging stations are being conducted actively. fundamental in most relevant studies is that demand is associated with population. however, alongside a viewpoint that users of a facility are vehicles, traffic flow would be a primary instance which arises demand. given a region, we consider a road network with links and nodes associated with roads and intersections. given an origin-destination pair, each traffic shall flow on the shortest path. in this context, there is a concept called cannibalization, reflecting multiple facilities deprive the others of demand flowing on the same single path. a model explaining this phenomenon is called the flow-capturing location-allocation model (fclm). meanwhile, evs have a significant constraint which should be taken into account in formulation; their driving distance is shorter than gasoline-powered vehicles. thus, it is not adequate to apply the fclm as it is to evs. in light of this, we propose a new location-allocation model designed for ev charging stations. the model is an outgrowth of the standard fclm, for which an out-of-battery situation does not occur. the distance between multiple facilities allocated on same path is minimized.","transportation, location, flow-capturing, 392",,"yohei kakimoto graduate school of science and engineering hosei university tokyo, japan yohei.kakimoto.9t@stu.hosei.ac.jp hiroyuki goto department of industrial and systems engineering hosei university tokyo, japan goto-h@hosei.ac.jp yoichi shimakawa department of computer science & technology salesian polytechnic tokyo, japan simakawa@salesio-sp.ac.jp prommas panote graduate school of science and engineering hosei university tokyo, japan prommas.panote@gmail.com",
4,Fleet Management Through Vehicle Routing Problem And  Multi Depot Vehicle Scheduling Problem: A Literature,"nowadays, one of the objectives of fleet management is to reduce fleet size and costs and to improve efficiency at the level of assignment, scheduling, and routing. in this paper, we present a literature review focusing on solution methods by analyzing 245 journal papers dealing with exact methods as well as heuristics and metaheuristics to solve large instances of two main problems in this area, namely the vehicle routing problem (vrp) and the multi depot vehicle scheduling problem (mdvsp).","fleet management, vrp, mdvsp, heuristics","In the present time, transportation management has become increasingly important, especially when we take into consideration the increase in demography and human development, which generate high demands. Therefore, plants implantations have become exponential to meet these demands, making logistics management difficult in terms of supply, shipping, and transportation of personnel; as there are several modes of transportation, this management becomes much more complicated to manage. In our paper, we are interested in the VRP and MDVSP, because they have a common objective which is to reduce the fleet size and then to reduce the costs. The objective of this literature review is to give an idea about the solution methods that have been used to tackle such problems in recent papers in this area. 400","review ziyad bahou equipe moad6 mohammadia school of engineers mohammed v university of rabat, morocco ziyad.bahou@hotmail.fr jamal elhachmi laboratory of electronics and telecommunications mohammadia school of engineers (emi), rabat, morocco jamal_elhachimi@hotmail.com","References

5,Scrap Reduction Of Railroader Axle On Carajás Railroad  Francisco Das Chagas Barbosa Nascimento,"during the wheelset maintenance process, the number of the axles is reduced by scrapping which makes it difficult to comply with the wagon maintenance plan. to re–establish the number of wheelsets, it is necessary to purchase new axles at a cost u$ 2,386.36 per unit. the average number of scrap axles is 26.44 units or 5.4% per month, which raises the maintenance costs of the wagons. thus, the problem was identified, the goal was defined based on history, and it was stratified with tree diagram, pareto, sequential graph, boxplot and histogram. from the tree diagram, we identified the components involved with the problem of the high scrap rate of axle 6.1/2x12 by groove in the sleeve. then, the brainstorming session of the causes of the groove was elaborated, the causes were prioritized for study by correlation, q-square test, boxplot, histogram and soft flexion test. then, the proven causes for treatment, elaboration and effective action plan were prioritized. the result was that, while 3,03% of the groove axes studied were scrapped up to 5.47 months, 35.43% of the tested axles (127 units) went through this period without groove. the expenditure avoided with the 127 axles of the sample was about u$ 223,810.98. the projected avoided expenditure 4 years (large scale application) is about u$ 1,562,583.81. the completion of the work was by the pilot test and serves as a basis for large- scale application of the solution in the fleet.","scrap, axle, groove, railroad","The axis flexion is the largest responsible for the generation of groove, but due to its resolution in changing the design of the axle, it becomes something very expensive, then remains to control the dimension of the wear rings and backing ring to allow interference between them and the axis, eliminating the contact wear that originates the groove. Thus, maintaining interferences between these elements will be the way to avoid groove on axle.

9,A Drivers’ Performance Assessment Model Based On Fuel  Economy Measurements,"currently, it is a common practice within transport companies to reduce fuel consumption of their fleet by awarding best drivers with public symbolic recognitions, as part of their programs to promote efficient driving. usually fuel economy (fe) is the key performance indicator used to evaluate them. however, fe depends on several other parameters such as the working route, vehicle weight and vehicle technology. therefore, companies with a diverse fleet composition require a fair kpi to select their best drivers. in this work, we present a model to assess drivers’ performance based on fe measurements. based on multivariate statistical analysis of one-year fe data of an urban and interurban bus transit company, we found that drivers’ fe exhibit a normal distribution when they are grouped within three categories: (a) the route, representing the driving cycle; (b) the vehicle age, representing the engine technology, and (c) the number of axles, representing the weight of the vehicle. thus, the standard statistical analysis to identify outliers was used to identify best drivers and vehicles that require maintenance.",,,"jenny díaz ramírez department of engineering universidad de monterrey monterrey, n.l. 66238, mexico jenny.diaz@udem.edu josé ignacio huertas energy and climate change research group school of engineering and science tecnologico de monterrrey monterrey, n.l., 68849, méxico jhuertas@itesm.mx",

In the case of the Queretaro region, there is a growing generation of capabilities in the aerospace industry in the last decade, however to achieve the consolidation of this industry in the region, greater efforts of articulation and coordination among the agents that make up the system, can be achieved through strategies and policies in joint collaboration. For example, nowadays, in some very special cases, companies make agreements with educational institutions to carry out training programs for their employees tailored to their needs, the experience seems to indicate that these tailored courses are more successful than the standardized ones, at least in the case of relatively short trainings for basic technicians, a course to cover the common needs of the companies of the industry offered by the UNAQ (Universidad Nacional Aeronáutica de Querétaro) are a success for the companies because the institution has the capabilities and infrastructure to offer tailor-made courses for companies and are highly valued by them. 468","christian muñoz-sanchez, maría del roció soto-flores, luis rocha-lona, susana garduño-román business school national polytechnic institute of mexico mexico city, mexico cmunozs@ipn.mx, mrsoto03@yahoo.com.mx, lrocha@ipn.mx, sgarduno@ipn.mx jose arturo garza-reyes centre for supply chain improvement the university of derby derby, uk j.reyes@derby.ac.uk","References

11,A Literature Review And Further Research Direction In  Cross-Docking,"cross-docking is a logistic technique that can help in cutting inventory costs while increasing the goods. the paper reviews literature in cross-docking regarding to operation problems and the metaheuristic methods used for solving those problems in order to support the future research in developing a new decision models. the result showed that though there are many articles of relevance with regard to either truck or dock door, there were found very few articles that focus on the tasks scheduling in cross-docking. thus, it needs to be stated that the research gap in the cross- docking platform would need to be filled by focusing on task scheduling and including resource capacity in models more practical in real world problems. in addition, taking into consideration other objectives or even multiple objectives could be an alternative approach for future research. furthermore, modern technology makes cross-docking feasible and able to develop suitable business models. therefore to enhance cross-docking operations to be a smart and intelligent logistics system especially for small and medium enterprise (sme), creating adapted concepts and design solutions should be developed for providing a systematic management of smart operation in cross-docking and synchronized to the other cross-docking problems.","cross-docking, task scheduling",,"dollaya buakum graduate program in industrial engineering, department of industrial engineering faculty of engineering, chiang mai university chiang mai 50200, thailand dollaya_b@hotmail.com warisa wisittipanich excellent center in logistics and supply chain management, department of industrial engineering, faculty of engineering, chiang mai university chiang mai 50200, thailand warisa.o@gmail.com","References

12,A Methodology For Combined Maintenance Decision With  Quality Control And Production Scheduling For Multi Machine,"maintenance, production scheduling, and quality control are the three important functions, which can improve the performance of a manufacturing system. in the operational context, all these shop floor activities have an interacting effect with each other. for example, while production scheduling; it is assumed that the machines are continuously available during production. however, in real manufacturing systems, machines may undergo failure and hence some unavailability periods such as preventive/corrective maintenance activities may exist during production. similarly, preventive maintenance (pm) activities take time that could have been utilized for production purposes. also, delaying the preventive maintenance or inadequate maintenance may degrade the machine condition which in turn may degrade the quality of the products being manufactured on the machine resulting in large amount of rework, rejection and scrap. hence, there exists a strong interrelationship between production scheduling, maintenance and quality control. however, these shop floor activities are done mostly independent of each other. this paper presents a methodology for combining selective maintenance, production scheduling and quality control for multi machine system. the objective is to obtain the minimum cost solution for the simultaneous decision on maintenance, production schedule and quality control. the proposed approach results in the sequence for the batches on each machine, the maintenance actions for components and the quality control parameters. a simulated annealing algorithm is used for optimization. a numerical example is presented to demonstrate the proposed approach.","integrated approach, maintenance, quality control",,"system dr. pravin p. tambe* department of industrial engineering, shri ramdeobaba college of engineering & management, nagpur, india tambep@rknec.edu, tambepp@gmail.com dr. makarand s. kulkarni department of mechanical engineering, indian institute of technology bombay, powai, mumbai, india",

16,"Hypothesis Combination Using Genetic Algorithm  Kuan-Yu Lai, Jhin-Wun Wang And Chien-Liang Liu","improvement of machine learning performance is always an important issue in machine learning community. ensemble learning has been shown to be able to normally improve model performance by combining various algorithms in the model. most winners of large-scale data science competitions use ensemble learning technique to get high scores. given available machine learning algorithms, ensemble learning involves two tasks, hypothesis selection and hypothesis combination. hypothesis selection is about selecting the algorithms that are beneficial to model performance into the ensemble learning model, while hypothesis combination is related to determine the combination coefficients of the algorithms in the model. this work focuses on hypothesis combination problem, and we formulate it into an optimization problem. we propose to use genetic algorithm (ga) to tackle this optimization problem. the ga is a search heuristic for the purpose of solving optimization problem, which is a part of evolutionary computation. ga is inspired by the theory of natural evolution, which comprises several components, including selection, crossover and mutation. there are five phases involved in a typical ga algorithm: initial population, fitness function, selection, crossover, and mutation. ga begins with an initial population which can be regarded as a set of solutions. next, a fitness function has to be defined to determine the fitness of each individual. once the fitness score for each individual is computed, the selection and crossover are used to generate the fitting offspring. for a small amount of new offspring, some of their genes will mutate with a low probability. the whole process will repeat until the population converges. this work follows ga process to encode the problem, and defines appropriate fitness function according to the characteristics of the problem. we conduct experiments to evaluate the proposed approach in ensemble learning on a multi-class classification dataset, red wine quality. we transform this problem into a binary classification problem, and use ten classification algorithms in the hypothesis pool, including support vector machine, random forest, decision tree, gradient boosting, adaboost, gaussian naïve bayes, logistic regression, nu-support vector machine, stochastic gradient descent and nearest centroid. to determine the combination coefficients of each model, the continuous encoding of chromosomes is represented as binary chromosomes of approximation, and f1 is used as the fitness function. we use f1 score as the evaluation metric, and compare the proposed method with several alternatives. the experimental results indicate that the proposed method is comparative in determining the combination coefficients of algorithms in the ensemble learning.","ensemble learning, taiwan",,"department of industrial engineering and management national chiao tung university 1001 university road, hsinchu, taiwan 300, roc sasuke11291@gmail.com, bee806806806@gmail.com, clliu@mail.nctu.edu.tw",
17,Multiperiod Reliable Uncapacitated Facility Location  Problem,"facility location problem is a class of combinatorial optimization problems that has been extensively studied in the literature. different variants of facility location problems have been used to model a wide variety of problems ranging from location of servers in communication networks to warehouses in a supply chain network to location of emergency services such as ambulances in public service systems. while the conventional models have been successful in providing solution to many real life location problems, these models make the assumption that facilities, once located, remain functional forever. this assumption is far from reality as facilities at times become non-functional (or fail) due to a variety of reasons including natural calamities, union strikes, terrorist attacks etc. the effects of such failures have become more pronounced due to the increased dependence on facilities because of adoption of lean paradigm. therefore, researchers have proposed reliable facility location models, which incorporate the failure prone nature of the facilities. however, the ruflp models studied in the literature can be classified as single period ruflp, as these models make two implicit assumptions. first, they assume that a facility, if failed, remains failed through out the rest of the horizon, and similarly, a facility, if functional, remains functional through out. second, they also assume that all the facility failures are realized simultaneously. both of these assumptions are rather restrictive and do not hold true for many real life situations. therefore, in this paper, we introduce the multiperiod reliable uncapacitated facility location problem (mruflp) that relaxes these assumptions by accounting for facility recovery after a failure, and allowing the facility failures to realize at different times in the planning horizon. more specifically, we present a two stage stochastic programming formulation, an extensive formulation and a non-linear integer programming formulation for the mruflp. we present a constant factor approximation algorithm for the problem and also present a fast heuristic to solve real life instances of the problem.","reliable, multi-period, dynamic",,"megha sharma and sumanta basu operations management group indian institute of management calcutta kolkata, india megha@iimcal.ac.in, sumanta@iimcal.ac.in arnab adhikari operations management department indian institute of management ranchi ranchi, india arnab.a@iimranchi.ac.in",
18,Proposal Of K-Principal Points For Binary Data By  Introducing A Dendrogram,"in recent years, many studies on principal points, which was proposed by flury (1990), have been developed in the field of statistical analysis. when a probability density function is divided into several regions for the data for which the probability distribution is assumed, the points representing the respective regions are called the principal points. on the other hand, there are numerous data, including selection type questionnaire data and personal profile data, which can return binary (0 or 1) values that assume the distributions of multivariate binary data. in regard to this, haruka yamashita and suzuki (2010) proposed principal points for the distribution of binary data based on the framework of the conventional principal points scheme. in this research, we propose a new search method by introducing a dendrogram for binary (0 or 1) type k-principal points (haruka yamashita and hideo suzuki; 2010). in this search method, we aggregate n samples into k groups using dendrograms obtained from a cluster analysis. then, the minimum binary type vector is obtained for each group by finding the sum of the squares of the distances from each sample, and we set them as the principal points. furthermore, we classified various “line superiority organizations” using binary data and separating their characteristics into a few (k) typical types (principal points) whose characteristics are similar, as an example of an application of the proposed method. a “line superiority organization” is an organization scheme with members who have high levels of expertise and authority, who actually carry out duties as lines (junichi nagakura and hiroshi yamashita; 2002). for example, universities, hospitals, airlines, auditing corporations, think tanks, and others are can be considered as line superiority organizations. through this research, we describe the various characteristics of the “line superiority organizations” in a concise form, and we examine the validity and effectiveness of the proposed method from these results.","diversity, binary data, cluster analysis",,"sunhee kwon graduate school of business administration meiji university tokyo, japan sunnyktd3@yahoo.co.jp takaaki kawanaka institute for innovation in international engineering education, graduate school of engineering the university of tokyo 7-3-1 hongo, bunkyo-ku, tokyo, japan kawanaka@cce.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp hiroshi yamashita department of commerce, meiji university 1-1 kanda-surugadai, chiyoda-ku, tokyo, japan hyamas@meiji.ac.jp",

We have considered the factor impact the performance cold chain for exported based on literature review of agriculture performance measurement supply chain. The factors were managed from frequently being used in the literature for mention the most useful factor. After that, we have interviewed export of longan fruit expert to consider the appropriate factor. Then, we group of the factor by regarding the implication of each aspect which refer to a priority of the factor based on the AHP method. Consequently, we have performed of decision-making criteria for weighting cold chain performance evaluation is separated into kinds of 4 main factors and 11 sub-factors.

21,Deviation Degree Between Ideal And Real Of Domain Transition  Probability In Resource Circulation Considering Production,"the authors propose ""the domain transition probability model for resource circulation"" that is developed from ""the conceptual model for resource circulation"". the former model (conceptual model) is a qualitative model that describes resource circulation between the natural space and social space on earth by domain transition of four areas, namely the resource domain → production domain → consumption domain → waste domain → resource domain → ..., macroscopically. the latter model (domain transition probability model) is a scheme that enables the quantitative analysis of the earth’s environment in the future by introducing the domain transition probability matrix and state vector in the conceptual model. given the current (t = 0) state vector and domain transition probability matrix, we can predict the state vectors at time t and t → ∞. however, when considering resource circulation on earth, the authors designate the state wherein the intake, expulsion, and natural purification rates are equal as an ideal state for achieving smooth resource circulation. further, the authors have conducted research on the ""three element deviation degree"" for quantitatively describing the deviation degrees of these three ideal and real elements. in this research, in consideration of the deviation degree of synchronization between production and sales in corporate activities, the authors propose the ""four element deviation degree,"" which synthesizes the ""three element deviation degree"" and ""synchronization deviation degree"". by doing this, a quantitative discussion of the gap between the ideal and the real in the four domain transitions, including corporate activities, can be conducted. in this research, simple numerical examples on the current (t = 0) state vector (initial state vector) and domain transition probability matrix are established. further, the crisis situation of earth’s environment in the future is implicated by analyzing the relation between these deviation degrees and the resource, inventory, in-use, and waste proportions.","earth environment, deviation degree",,"synchronization ratio takaaki kawanaka institute for innovation in international engineering education, graduate school of engineering the university of tokyo 7-3-1 hongo, bunkyo-ku, tokyo, japan kawanaka@cce.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp hiroshi yamashita department of commerce, meiji university 1-1 kanda-surugadai, chiyoda-ku, tokyo, japan hyamas@meiji.ac.jp shoichi kaneko faculty of management information, yamanashi gakuin university 2-4-5 sakaori, kofu city, yamanashi, japan shoichi@ygu.ac.jp",
22,Design And Analysis Of Ducted Wind Turbine For Roof-Top  Installation,"small-scale wind turbines are useful in urban areas as a source of electricity, where the main focus is towards producing optimum power in a limited area with a low wind velocity. shrouding of a wind turbine with a proper shape is found to be an effective method to augment wind velocity. the present work aims to power one room of an average house in a typical tier two city in india. a duct is designed for rooftop installation by referring to the wind availability data for an average height of 10m. a 2-dimensional numerical scheme is developed to optimize the shape of the duct using ansys fluent. the sst k-w turbulence model is used to capture the velocity fluctuations. optimized shape of the duct is a convergent-divergent section, with the wind turbine placed at the throat. it is found that the convergent section does not have a significant effect on the wind velocity at the throat, but helps in directing the path. introducing divergent section increases the wind velocity and achieves an average velocity increment of 1.32, which is close to the designed theoretical value 1.4. output power is obtained by selection of proper airfoil and generator. introduction of vortex generator at the divergent end offers an additional 15% increase in wind velocity at the throat, which is 10% higher than the designed theoretical ratio.","wind turbine, duct, cfd",,"agney bhakare, preeti ranka and anket telkapalliwar b.tech. in mechanical engineering veermata jijabai technological institute, mumbai, 400019, india agny.bhakre@gmail.com , preeti.ranka12@gmail.com , anket2677@gmail.com mandar. v. tendolkar assistant professor, mechanical engineering department veermata jijabai technological institute, mumbai, 400019, india mvtendolkar@me.vjti.ac.in sanjay m. g. associate professor, mechanical engineering department veermata jijabai technological institute, mumbai, 400019, india sanjaymg@vjti.org.in",
23,How The Difference In Product Characteristics Affects The  Relationship With Customers? ~In The Case Of The Electronics,"abstract the electronic parts industry of japan is very internationally competitive. however, the types of suppliers can be roughly classified into two types; a specialized supplier and a generalized supplier according to the on-going “selection and concentration” of business operations, and each supplier has a different product characteristics. in recent years, the electronic parts industry in japan attempts to increase its focus on the automotive market. while expanding auto parts transactions, it can be thought the differences in product characteristics in each supplier will make a difference in the relationship with customers. in this paper, by comparing analysis of a specialized supplier and a generalized supplier increasing their focus on auto parts transactions, it is clarified generalized supplier tends to maintain fixed relationships with customers in comparison with specialized supplier in the auto parts transaction.",supplier system,"For electronic parts suppliers, increasing its focus on auto parts means the basic product design concepts are made ""integral"" or ""modular"", and the proportion of integral type is increased. In particular, it means the parts become to be compounded for a generalized supplier. Particularly in the development of composite parts for automotive market, as suppliers are required for engaging in the advanced development and coordinating for each customer, investment in R&D must become a relationship specific investment, and suppliers can only recover development expenses from a transaction relationship with a specific customer. For that reason, there are some aspects that suppliers need to deepen relationships with current customers and improve their appraisal. On the other hand, a specialized supplier is considered to make efforts such as modularizing the inside of the composite parts, expediting common use of composite parts and diversifying them to other customers. In this way, electronic parts suppliers are required not only to build capabilities and secure profits in transactions with current makers, but also to emphasize the possibility of diversion to other customers. Although this research has analyzed two suppliers, it is necessary to implement some case studies and consider whether the results are adaptable to other suppliers. These aspects would be the object of future studies","parts industry increasing its focus on the automotive market~ chihiro sato graduate school of economics and management tohoku university kawauchi, 27-1, aoba-ku, sendai, miyagi, japan chihiro.sato.d6@tohoku.ac.jp",
24,An Investigation Of Student Perspective For  E-Learning Readiness Measurement,"e-learning and other online-based learning media innovations were introduced to improve the quality of education. the main aim of this study is to measure e-learning readiness from the point of view of students at a university in karawang indonesia. the questionnaire was used to determine the extent where e-learning readiness of first-year to fourth year students. the study was conducted in the condition of the absence of the e-learning methods applications. a measurement model of e-learning readiness presented by aydin and tasci is used to measure people readiness, self-development readiness, technology readiness, and innovation readiness. it was found that, the four proposed factors indicate in the ready category, but requires a slight increase in several factors. based on the elr readiness analysis method, two of the four aspects have high elr scores are self-development and technological aspects. while aspects that have low elr scores are people and innovation aspects. therefore, both aspects require more serious improvements so that the e-learning method is ready and can be continued.","information system, student","Overall, the level of readiness for the implementation of e-learning based on ELR Aydin & Tasci's readiness analysis method is included in the ""ready"" category in the implementation of e-learning, but requires a slight increase in several factors (MX=3.77 > MELR=3.41). The four proposed factors indicate in the ready category, but requires a slight increase in several factors. Based on the ELR readiness analysis method, two of the four aspects have high ELR scores, there are self-development and technological aspects. While aspects that have low ELR scores are people and innovation aspects. Therefore, both aspects require more serious improvements so that the e- learning method is ready and can be continued. Although readiness measurement is very important, this study only uses four aspects in measurement, there are people, self-development, technology, and innovation. There are still many readiness factors that need to be considered. Chapnick (Chapnick 2002) revealed that the readiness factor was represented by eight factors.

Under randomly situated bins condition, we presented possible scenarios of the crane moving in the system and showed how we procced for the deduction of this rate by the calculation of each scenario’s cycle time according to its mode.

34,A Markovian Perspective Of Airport Departure Process  Ch V Sai Praveen And Mayank Anand,"the demand for aviation has been growing at an ever increasing rate. as a result there is an increasing pressure on airlines to operate more flights to cater to this demand. the key bottleneck in this process is the airport capacity. airports, depending on their layout and size, have a stipulated capacity in terms of the number of aircraft they can handle in an hour. increasing this capacity often involves creating new taxiways or increasing the number of runways which is capital intensive. the construction work might require a part of the airport to be shut down resulting in losses which adds on to the cost. hence airports have a high inertia to increase capacity. at most major international airports it is observed that operational capacity is much lower than that of the actual airport capacity. the operational capacity can be as low as 83% of the actual capacity at some airports. this gap suggests that there is huge potential to increase the number of aircraft handled by an airport without increasing its physical capacity. this inefficiency arises due to several factors such as irregular pushback rates, adverse weather conditions and arrival traffic congestion. our work proposes to model the aircraft departure process as a markov chain to estimate the time a particular aircraft would require to take off starting from the departure terminal. the model takes into account the departure demand, arrival throughput and weather conditions. the departure demand and the arrival throughput are given as parameters while the weather conditions are provided by using a well established surrogate metric, route availability planning tool. we calculate the mean time spent at each transient node to predict the time it will take for the flight to takeoff from the time it leaves the terminal. given that our model considers each departure terminal, taxiway and runway as nodes, it is agnostic to the specifications of the airport. it can be applied to an airport containing multiple runways. another feature of our model is that it provides a comprehensive estimate which includes pushback delays and the time taken on the runway. this eliminates the need to assume some probability distributions for the same. the model is used to predict the departure times of aircraft at three international airports, viz. john f. kennedy (jfk), newark liberty (ewr) and philadelphia (phl) using the data collected from faa’s aviation systems performance metrics (aspm) database. our model can be used to provide an accurate estimate of the time to departure for every aircraft enabling them to schedule pushbacks in an efficient manner. an efficient pushback schedule, which is fully informed of the arrivals and weather conditions, will minimize the time the aircraft spends taxiing, increasing the operational capacity of the airport.","airport, congestion",,"department of mechanical engineering indian institute of technology, kharagpur, west bengal, india chvspraveen@iitkgp.ac.in​, ​mayank.anand819@gmail.com",
35,Systems Thinking View On Impact Of Single Common Tax  On Warehousing Industries In India,"the logistics industry is a major support to the indian economy as it contributes a lot to the gdp. the entire country depends upon logistics for all its needs, right from basic food supply to big manufacturing machinery. the logistics cost in india is higher than in many countries. one of the main reason behind this is that there are too many taxes such as excise duty, service tax, sales tax/vat/cst, customs duty and entry /entertainment tax, etc. and numerous intra-state taxes which makes domestic production unfavorable option for manufacturers. in addition to this, any shipment that moves in different indian states was taxed multiple times as per various geographical locations. to overcome all these issues, the government of india introduced a single common tax, known as goods and service tax (gst). gst is a single tax on the supply of goods and services, right from the manufacturer to the consumer. the gst is pegged to transform india into a single integrated market. the warehousing sector would be both an enabler and beneficiary of india’s biggest tax reform. any positive changes in the warehousing and logistics will boost the global competitiveness of the country. the central region has the advantage to become the warehousing hub of the country because of its geographical location, proper road and railway networks that run both lengthwise and breadthwise, connecting the major metropolises due to the implementation of gst. this paper presents the system thinking view on the impact of gst on the warehousing sector from the location aspect. systems thinking approach is applied and a causal loop diagram is developed by considering various issues and important variables to show how the implementation of single common tax has affected the warehousing sector. with the implementation of gst, the central region of india will have an upper hand as compared to other parts of the country from the warehousing point of view. the major variables that we have considered while making the causal loop diagram are cost uniformity, inventory management, logistical costs, operational efficiency, and many more. an example of the warehousing industry is presented to clear the system thinking view. the proposed system thinking will help for the further development of system dynamics model on the major decisions related to logistics and several other factors that affect the supply chain of warehousing industries.","warehousing, single common tax, central region",,"priyankshu mukhopadhya and shreeya shahu department of industrial engineering shri ramdeobaba college of engineering and management nagpur, maharashtra 440013, india priyankshu12@gmail.com, shreeya.shahu@gmail.com dr. pravin p. tambe department of industrial engineering shri ramdeobaba college of engineering and management nagpur, maharashtra 440013, india tambep@rknec.edu",

Normally it has been attributed to beer various health benefits derived from the content of phenols, responsible for improving the cardiovascular system of our body. However, which relation exists in the phenolic content between the liquid that we ingest from the beer against the foam that we usually throw for reasons of taste, aroma and ignorance of the diversity of benefits contained in it. The innovation in this work is to characterize the beer foam to determine its real benefits and promote its intake according to its potential benefits in consumption. It has been proved that the phenolic content in beer foam is actually greater than the phenolic content in the liquid. It has also been observed in this work that when the foam returns to its liquid state, the phenolic content does not decrease, which means, that it is not a reversible process. It can be determined and affirmed that effectively the consumption of beer foam provides greater benefits than the liquid itself.","gerardo espinosa garza universidad de monterrey monterrey, nuevo león, méxico gerardo.espinosag@udem.edu",

For maintenance environment warehouse, it is possible to group spare parts according to the type of maintenance works. The group with the lowest COI ratio can be kept closest to the I\O point. Moreover, the parts of a group can be arranged according to their usage frequency. In the simulation study, it is found that the proposed method has the highest reduction in the distance travelled by the picking device in the warehouse compared to the other storage methods. So, the proposed storage method can be applied to any production warehouse where the order structures are limited. On the other hand, the storage method will be easy to implement and simple to understand by a warehouse manager when it is adopted. For this research, we consider a single-sided storage rack only. Therefore, the developed storage allocation model can be extended for multi rack warehouse system and figuring out the effects on the order picking efficiency. It is also suggested to considering different warehouse layout and incorporating more realistic issues that would be very interesting but challenging problem.","md. saiful islam department of industrial engineering and management khulna university of engineering & technology khulna-9203, bangladesh saifuliem@iem.kuet.ac.bd md. kutub uddin department of mechanical engineering khulna university of engineering & technology khulna-9203, bangladesh kutubuddin@me.kuet.ac.bd",

40,Information Systems  For Industrial Processes Support And Optimization,"this paper presents the document management systems (dms) as a support decision tool to optimize toyota caetano portugal s.a. (tcap) processes performance. the created systems were developed on the best practices of a business project management (bpm), for better structural implementation. the first system implementation was related to the warehouse materials requirement process, where an excel template with vba functions for fill automatization was built. it had a reduction of the overall paper consumption and time execution optimization, which means the gain of approximately of 0,10€ and 2,09€ per unit produced, respectively. it was also obtained an elimination of 4538 paper sheets per year. a second system was also developed, in order to provide a decision support system (dss) for documental management. several user forms were developed in vba code in order to provide a flexible and intuitively user interface experience. it reduced the users time decision making and the administrator maintenance, by a total of 26 minutes, corresponding to a 1,61€ reduction per unit built, which means an efficiency increase of 42%. the present work fits in the company's strategy for a more sustainable environment being a positive driver of industry 4.0 implementation.","industry 4.0, information system","Nowadays, to compete in a highly competitive market, it is essential that the organization take on the performance, which is the challenge of continuous improvement related with lean thinking methodology. The constant demand for process optimization allows the organization to respond to the growing needs of its owns customers. The goal is to manufacture the best product at the lowest cost as quickly as possible. These new systems used information and communication for an extensively autonomous information exchange, being able to combine production with business processes. Following the Industry 4.0 trend, these implemented systems decentralized manufacture in a smart way. They provided self-decision optimization, better data organization and, consequently, supply chain traceability. The elaboration of this project demonstrated that, to achieve relevant improvements, substantial investments or complex solutions are not needed. Using the resources available by the company, it was possible to reach the defined objectives and to present results that support the improvements obtained. The results achieved show the fulfilment of the objectives and the constraints proposed. The first system implementation, related to the warehouse materials requirement process had a reduction of the overall paper consumption and time execution optimization, less 0,10€ and 2,09€ per unit produced were gained, respectively. The elimination of 4538 paper sheets per year was also obtained. On the other hand, the second system reduced the users time decision making and the administrator maintenance, from 65 to 38 minutes, corresponding to a 1,61€ reduction per unit built. Therefore, it was demonstrated with the implementation, that the solution developed was accessible to all stakeholders in the process, the systems management was simple and it was autonomously assumed by the employees involved. 7 Future Optimization Since all methodology of continuous improvement is adjacent to the Toyota spirit, the projects carried out will never be completed and there is always room for improvement over time. In the first system developed, the real time synchronization with the ERP system of the company, is one of the main improvements listed to be done. This will provide a constant database update, eliminating information errors. Relatively to the second system, the creation of an action which leads to a print document of all the necessary items listed is the optimization to be made. 649","teresa pereira research center of mechanical engineering (cidem) institute of engineering of porto of polytechnic institute of porto, isep/p.porto, rua dr. antónio bernardino de almeida, 431, 4200-072, porto, portugal. mtp@isep.ipp.pt fernanda a. ferreira applied management research unit (uniag), school of hospitality and tourism of polytechnic institute of porto, rua d. sancho i, 981 4480-876, vila do conde, portugal faf@esht.ipp.pt andré silva mechanical engineering master student institute of engineering of porto of polytechnic institute of porto, isep/p.porto, rua dr. antónio bernardino de almeida, 431, 4200-072, porto, portugal. andre_filipe_silva@outlook.com","References

42,The Impact Of The Introduction Of Iso 9001 Standards –  Case Of A South African Power Station Refurbishment,"the iso standards provide a mechanism for organizations that desire to persistently address their clients' issues through their items and services and constantly improve in quality. this paper looks at how the profundity of iso 9001 execution impacts organization performance over the long haul. the study was conducted to determine the iso standards on project quality deliverables, to determine its relationship with regard to employees’ quality of work in a project. this study investigates two main questions; (1) can iso standards influence the end product or services? (2) can the introduction of the standards affect how employees think with regards to quality? this research follows a mixed approach, which is a combination of both the qualitative and quantitative approach. data collection techniques used include a random choice of research members from the examination populace in a fair-minded way, the institutionalized poll or intercession they get, and statistical strategies used to break down the information. the results indicate that the employees in company x believe that an introduction will significantly enhance execution. it is suggested that associations ought to receive iso standards in their daily practices, which will gradually increase the job effectiveness of the employees in the organization.","iso standards, iso certification, et al",", Recommendations and the Way Forward The results indicate that the employees in Company X believe that the introduction of ISO 9001 will significantly improve performance. However, this introduction should be supported by management commitment as some employees, although not opposed to change, might find it difficult to align themselves with the new standards. Shafiq, et al, (2014) state that the ISO certification position organisations for higher levels of performance. Hence the ISO certification have been endorsed internationally for years (Wu and Jang, 2013). There are recommended standards to different organisations that can expand the credibility of any organisation and assist in increasing the productivity of the organisation (Shafiq, et al, 2014). Ratnasingam, et al (2013) and Miller, et al, (2017) affirms that ISO certification have a positive influence in the organisational processes and the competency of management. It is recommended that organisations should adopt ISO standards in their daily practices, which will gradually increase the job effectiveness of the employees in the organisation (Basir and Davies, 2016). Additionally, it is recommended that Company X involves an employee whose primary task would be to champion the implementation of the ISO standard. This study sets the foundation for further research that may consider reviewing the state of affairs of ISO standard implementation in SMMEs to provide a clear view of the extent of ISO 9001 adoption in the industry. Further research may also consider looking into the factors that may prevent or advance the adoption of ISO standards within the power plant refurbishment companies.

43,Performance-Based Contracts For Energy Efficiency  Projects,"energy efficiency projects are often executed by specialized entities, namely energy service companies (escos). a typical esco's core business is conducted using performance-based contracts, whereby payment terms depend on the energy savings achieved. despite their success in public, commercial, and industrial sectors, escos in the residential sector are involved in fewer projects and face several challenges. first, an energy efficiency project often leads to changed consumption behavior; hence it is more difficult to evaluate the energy savings that are due to the project itself. the second challenge is that residential clients are more risk averse and, thus, less willing to contract for projects whose outcomes are uncertain. third, a lack of monitoring protocols leads to esco's moral hazard problems. this paper studies esco contract design issues, focusing primarily on the residential market for energy efficiency. as opposed to other sectors, coordinating contracts do not exist. we show, however, that simple piecewise linear contracts work reasonably well. to improve their profitability, escos can reduce uncertainty about the technology employed and/or develop ways of verifying post-project energy efficiency. since policy makers are understandably keen to promote energy efficiency, we show also how regulations and monetary incentives can reduce inefficiencies in escos' relationships and thereby maximize environmental benefits.","sustainable energy, energy efficiency",,"sam aflaki hec paris - operations management and information technology aflaki@hec.fr roman kapuscinski and liang ding university of michigan, stephen m. ross school of business",
44,Proceeding Of The International Conference On Industrial Engineering And Operations Management,"in this paper, various changes are presented on devices that transmit long-distance electromagnetic frequencies for product location (rfid). this research aims to improve the characteristics of a tag by changing its coating to ensure that it can tolerate working with higher temperatures than it currently supports (240 ° c). the objective is to introduce these modified tags in a company dedicated to the pressurized cutting of ""foam"" by means of presses and dies for the automotive industry. the implementation of rfid in the automotive plant aims to improve the current inventory system, minimize set-up times, which will lead us to minimize process times and company costs.","rfid, tag, productivity","This paper presented the need to improve inventory control of a company that has several products that are subjected to temperatures higher than 200 ° C. The introduction of RFID systems in inventory control is a competitive advantage since it reduces the operating costs of these processes. The innovation involves designing a plastic encapsulation for the TAG that can tolerate temperatures of 240 ° C. The methodology proposed in this work includes the incorporation of a modified process to what is currently done in PET production. To tolerate high temperatures, it is proposed to crystallize the PET to obtain an opaque crystalline plastic as demonstrated in the chemical equations presented above. The TAG, has behaved stable even with high temperatures and the information that has been assigned is information that has been maintained within the TAG. The instability is lost by the encapsulated plastic of the TAG since previously designing a TAG for high temperatures was not a necessity for any company. The design of the TAG package has been possible from a fundamentally theoretical perspective; the components (raw material) to make the encapsulation are difficult to obtain to be able to experiment, nevertheless, this work concluded its feasibility and its technical viability. With the implementation of the RFID system for the control of inventories, a considerable reduction was observed in the time lost in the search of parts without a specific location. Another important impact was accomplished with the reduction in the stop time for lines with missing tools. All of this was achieved with the development of access to the exact location of the pieces that have the TAG and with its technical description. This article provides an innovative option to allow the TAG of the RFID system to withstand high temperatures. Another advantage of the system is the feasibility of its implementation in parts that undergo treatments or processes with temperatures above 240 ° C without limiting its scope.","© ieom society international control creation of a rfid to improve productivity and inventory control gerardo espinosa-garza, jacobo tijerina aguilera universidad de monterrey san pedro garza garcía, nuevo león, méxico gerardo.espinosag@udem.edu, jacobo.tijerina@udem.edu imelda de jesús loera-hernández, natella antonyan tecnológico de monterrey monterrey, nuevo león, méxico iloera@tec.mx, nantonya@tec.mx",

46,Optimization Of Performance Measures In Finite Queueing  Systems,"to maintain their business competitiveness, manufacturing, telecommunication, and service companies develop their facilities and systems having optimal service rates and numbers of servers to function efficiently and effectively. these systems are best modeled as closed finite queueing network models and state dependent queues. however, because of blocking in these finite queueing networks, the optimal service rates and number of servers allocation issue is a challenging nonlinear mixed integer optimization problem. to tackle this difficult mathematical problem, first, we propose a queue decomposition method together with a nonlinear sequential quadratic optimization algorithm. extensive analyses and resolution of small topologies are performed and we show that the results are very encouraging and very close to those of simulation but requiring only a fraction of cpu times. then, this methodology is applied to larger supply chain topologies including a car-body shop case study where most of the operations are performed by robots that load and weld stamped steel parts. we show that the model yields encouraging results. finally, from these various experiments, we propose a set of recommendations and managerial insights relative to the importance of joint optimization of various performance measures in such systems.",material handling,,laoucine kerbache information systems and operations management department hec paris and hamad bin khalifa university qatar kerbache@hec.fr,
47,Comparison Between Hadoop And Spark,"big data is a technology that aims to capture, store, manage, and analyze large numbers of data with different types: structured, semi-structured and unstructured. these data are guided by the rule of the 5 vs: volume, velocity, variety, veracity and value. to analyze a large amount of information coming from several sources, the technological world of big data is based on clearly identified tools, including the hadoop framework and the apache spark. hadoop allows massive data storage with the hadoop distributed file system (hdfs) model, as well as the analysis with the mapreduce model, on a cluster that has one or more machines. apache spark analysis the distributed data, but it doesn’t contain a system storage. this article presents a comparative between the big data analysis methods offered by hadoop and spark, their architectures, operating modes and performances. indeed, we have first begun by a general overview of big data technology. we discuss about the hadoop framework and their components: hdfs and mapreduce the first element of our comparison, we offer a study of their methodology, their mode of data processing and their architecture, at the end of this section we present the hadoop ecosystem. we then continue with apache spark framework the second element of our study, we expos their features, their ecosystem and their mode of analysis of large data. at the end, we compare these last two elements hadoop and spark based on a detailed study.","big data, hadoop, spark, hdfs, mapreduce","To conclude, firstly Hadoop has a powerful distributed storage file (HDFS), with performances and features that are available for Big Data processing systems such as Hadoop MapReduce and Apache Spark. Hadoop MapReduce is a platform built for batch processing. It was very famous and very usable by multiple companies in several areas, because Hadoop MapReduce was the first technology that analyze mass distributed data. On the other hand, Apache Spark is the new brightest platform on the Big Data technology, it has better performances. The Spark is very profitable thanks to the data processing in memory, it is compatible with all of the data sources and file formats of Hadoop, also it has several APIs. Apache Spark even includes graph processing and machine-learning capabilities. Although some companies feel compelled to choose between Hadoop and Spark, the fact that isn't a direct fight. They are complementary technologies that work in tandem in some cases, or separately in other cases, depending on the data or the desired results. The truth is that Spark and Hadoop have a dependent relationship with each other. Hadoop provides options that Spark doesn't possess like HDFS, and Spark provides real-time, in-memory processing. The perfect scenario of Big Data, is that Hadoop and Spark work together on the same team. Our future work would focus on the Big Data analytics approach, more specifically in the area of health in Morocco. What we want precisely is to design a new model of treatment that is interested to health data, with powerful techniques and technologies of Big Data, which will benefit from the advantages and powers of the two Frameworks Hadoop and Spark. This model will take in two methods of treatment: the batch-processing paradigm and the real- time processing paradigm. 699","houssam benbrahim, hanaâ hachimi and aouatif amine gs laboratory ""lgs"", boss-team, national school of applied sciences, ibn tofail university, kenitra, morocco. houssam.benbrahim@uit.ac.ma, hanaa.hachimi@univ-ibntofail.ac.ma and amine_aouatif@univ- ibntofail.ac.ma","References

48,Are Eggs What You Actually Think: Here’S Something  Interesting You Might Have No Idea!,": the egg is composed of three components viz. egg shell, egg white, egg yolk. egg has rich protein and nutrient quantity. the egg when soaked in vinegar show physical change such that its shell becomes very soft to touch. this is due to the egg is put in vinegar; the calcium carbonate of the shell reacts chemically with the vinegar's acid. this reaction is named oxidation. in every chemical reaction, the initial substances disappear and they transform into new substances. after a few minutes we observe the formation of little bubbles, meaning a gas is being generated. it becomes just like a water balloon but the study says that it’s a rubber egg whereas the egg does not show any rubber like property. finally, the egg increased in size because the liquid in the container has passed through the semi permeable membrane and has entered the egg. after the 24 hours we proved the egg bounces at different heights. also study says that egg when placed in vinegar solution and after becoming soft it becomes hard when kept open to atmosphere but the experimental setup and the observation helps to prove this false. the egg vinegar also has many medical uses.","egg shell, egg white, container","Vinegar and eggs have rich nutrients. In this study, the mixed form of derived products, vinegar–egg solution and its products helps to contradict the concept of the rubber egg and gives a stand to water balloon egg. The vinegar egg has high content of nutrients still many people don’t know about its medicinal use. The recipes if used properly then it can help to cure that particular disease. Every coin has two sides just like that it has side effects if the eggs are pickled for long time in vinegar solution then they can be rotten and eating such eggs can be harmful for the health. A frequent study found that this vinegar eggs can be used as anticancer. The study says that when the egg soaked from vinegar solution is kept open to atmosphere it becomes hard again which is contradictory. The egg shrinks as it losses the water content which it absorbed due to osmosis process from the vinegar solution. This egg when placed again in the water swells. This shows osmosis and reverse osmosis process takes place in this process. Also, if any color is added to vinegar solution then the egg gains the same color. This is because of the process of osmosis some 713","mr. nachiket sachin deole, department of engineering sciences and humanities, savitribai phule university, pune, india. mr. shantanu shivkumar pathak, department of engineering sciences and humanities, savitribai phule university, pune, india. guided by: mrs. manasi ghamande, department of engineering sciences and humanities, savitribai phule university, pune, india","References

49,Creating A Kpi Tree For Monitoring And Controlling Key  Business Objectives Of First Mile Logistics Services,"one of the key assets of an ecommerce platform is its logistics services. first mile logistics is a term usually applied to the leg of supply chain which is responsible for picking products from sellers and delivering them to the hub or warehouse of an ecommerce company. effectively defined key process indicators in any organization help them to be both efficient and effective. by applying the methodology discussed in this paper an e-commerce organization of global repute was able to successfully define the key performance indicators (kpi) related to its first mile logistics section of the overall supply chain. the kpi tree helped the organization to create a supply chain reliability measurement and control visualization platform that enabled it to control the existing process, identify and resolve assignable abnormalities there by ensuring stable supply chain. a well designed kpi tree will also enable an organization with insights required for future capability building.","logistics, kpi, first mile, ecommerce","Through this paper we wanted to demonstrate the process and the philosophy that can be adopted by any E- Commerce organization to define KPI tree for any leg of their supply chain. The paper clearly articulates the benefits of a KPI tree for any organization to manage its present and to plan for its future. We also touched upon how to identify the key guiding factors for any supply chain design. We spoke about how process map and FMEA acts like essential building blocks of any KPI tree. Finally, through the representation of a KPI tree visualization dashboard we wanted to communicate how the theory and practical application can be seamlessly merged to create an ecosystem of better monitor and control of any supply chain.

52,Budget Allocation Model For Public Senior High School  Academic Programs,"the implementation of senior high school program in the philippine educational system requires the national government to provide funding to public high schools to address students’ different needs because of different demands required by the different academic tracks offered such as general academic strand (gas), humanities and social sciences (humss), science, technology, engineering and mathematics (stem), and accountancy and business management (abm). however, there are no standardized budget allocation guidelines being followed by the implementing public high schools. the lack of a defined and standardized budget allocation process poses a threat on mismanagement of the available budget. through the defined factors and quantifying the prioritization of the different learning outcomes of the academic programs into priority weights, this paper intends to develop a budget allocation model using goal programming. the budget allocation model was developed using the data of different public schools in cavite. the results showed an improvement on the achievement of priority weights by an average of 24.76%. the budget allocation model was also translated into a system to allow the public schools to generate the satisficing results on any given year and interpret results with the aid of analytics on the formulated budget.","senior high school, budget allocation, mathematical model","The formula used in formulating a budget for the Senior High School is referred to as Boncodin formula. The variables in the formula are the number of students, number of classrooms and number of teachers. These variables are the initial factors considered in the budget formulation. The actual expenditures were also analyzed to determine how the budget formulated from the Boncodin formula was spent and found that most of the expenses were expenses directly related to students’ needs. These expenses are the: electricity expenses and, supplies and materials expenses. In determining the factors that affect and contribute to efficient budget allocation, the researcher first determined the target learning outcomes of the Senior High School academic programs. This was done to make sure that the mathematical model for the budget allocation are focused on the learning outcomes. To quantify the learning outcomes, the researcher followed the Analytical Hierarchy Process. The data used in the AHP was from a survey for the SHS teachers. Through AHP and by using the Expert Choice software, the researchers computed for the prioritization weights of each learning outcome. These prioritization weights were compared to the DepEd priority weights, which was derived from the number of hours spent for every learning outcomes.

53,Design And Simulation Based Validation Of A Reconfigurable  Manufacturing System,"the manufacturing industry has a high potential of being exposed to continuous market changes that need to adapt successfully to a rapidly changing market environment. therefore, the ability to cope with these factors is vital. reconfigurable manufacturing systems (rms) have a cost-effective response to rapid changes, as well as have the capability to cope with market changes (due to the variation in customer and supplier behaviors) by adapting to various manufacturing systems. in this paper the authors present a method to assess and choose the appropriate manufacturing design layout. three different configurations have been designed using the cad program solidworks; the configurations were compared using arena 14.7 simulation software to simulate the process of manufacturing a product. the configurations were then evaluated using various performance measures, including resource utilization, waiting time and throughput. the evaluation was used to identify the appropriate configuration design. the results show that the proposed methodology can offer a suitable configuration that can achieve high performance as well as adapt to market changes.",rms configuration,Designing a manufacturing system that can cope with changes rapidly and precisely is a major objective for companies. This paper presents a methodology to identify a manufacturing system that can handle different changes in the market environment. The evaluation and identification process mainly consists of a simulation model that can provide different performance measures that enable choosing a suitable configuration. A methodology was developed here to find a manufacturing system aimed at coping with changes in a precise manner as well achieving high performance. Three configuration designs were used as alternatives to determine which configuration was most suitable using the developed methodology. The three configurations were evaluated via ARENA simulation software. Several types of data were collected regarding the product and configurations.

54,"Musculoskeletal Risk Assessment Among The Male Workers  Engaged In Craft Sectors Of Jaipur, India","this study investigates the musculoskeletal problems in four craft sectors in the jaipur, india, namely carpet washing, trimming, alignment and wood carving. a field study was conducted in 13 workshops of several handicraft manufacturers, and 122 male respondents were randomly selected for the survey. the data about pain occurrence at different body and hand regions among the participants were collected using a questionnaire. mean perceived exertion among the handicraft workers during respective craft tasks was estimated according to borg’s rated perceived exertion (rpe) scale the highest prevalence of symptoms in the body regions was reported for the last 12 months were the wrist, lower back, shoulders. whereas, metacarpal, thenar eminence, and hypothenar were the most prominent hand regions of discomfort. these discomfort regions could be due to the poor workstation and hand tool design, and awkward working postures. furthermore, the study revealed that the mean scores of the rpe were significantly higher with higher age and experience. it can be postulated that the work system including hand tools should be redesigned that may reduce the symptoms of musculoskeletal disorders. health habits also play a role in rpe, albeit to a moderate degree.","handicrafts, ergonomics","Overall, it can be concluded that there was risk of discomfort in different body and hand regions among the handicraft workers. The findings in this study can lead to the need for attention as well as investigation of current hand tools and workstation, leading improvement in working posture and efficiency of the worker. The other major contributions of the paper was proposing the effect of age, experience and health habits on rated perceived exertion on the workers engaged in craft activities. It must be borne in mind that this study was only conducted on a small exposed group of workers. The future work includes to design/redesign the hand tool interventions focusing on the inferences drawn from this study.","ashish kumar singh, makkhan lal meena and himanshu chaudhary a. department of mechanical engineering malaviya national institute of technology jaipur, rajasthan 302017, india singh.mechanical@yahoo.com, mlmeenamnit@gmail.com, hchaudhary.mech@mnit.ac.in",
55,Time Driven Activity Based Costing In Outpatient Logistics  Kakrona Din,"healthcare industry is one of the most important sectors nowadays, which providing goods and services to patients with curative, preventive, rehabilitative, and palliative care. there are patients flow, medicine flow, material flow and information flow in this supply chain. patients service level and cost expense increasing are important issues to take into consideration. outpatient department is the main department requires more attention in term of patient logistics activity and process management. based on this, the study focuses on patient logistics activity and cost analysis of each activity in a clinic in the outpatient department of the case study hospital. the crucial purpose is to analyze activity, determine resource use, estimate time processing in each activity, and calculate the unit cost of each patient activity in an outpatient clinic. time driven activity based costing is used as a solution tool. the results might serve the clinic administrator for cost controlling system and process management and obtain a guideline for choosing the appropriated costing system for the hospital.",outpatient clinic,"As the growth of the healthcare industry and more competition in the healthcare environment, the hospital needs to develop the efficient costing system to provide financial feedback. Time Driven Activity-based costing become the alternative tool for administrators to use for efficiency non-human resource and human resource management and to improve service quality. In this research, we try to explain the Time driven Activity-based costing development in an OPD clinic in the hospital. The TDABC seem to be faster model adaptability in the real world operates. In this study, it was found that medicine clinic in the hospital was identified into 6 activities such as body weight, look up appointment card, record vital sign, meet with the doctor in the treatment room, check document after meeting with the doctor and need to further to Special treatment. The activity was classified in two 2 groups of patient, the first group was called “Without Special treatment” that no need to further to treatment after meeting with the doctor in the clinic and the second group was called ""With Special treatment "" which the patient needs to further to treatment. Based on the result of table 4 and 5, the unit cost for the patient without procedure and patient with the procedure range from 3.96 to 155.28 baht/year/patient. The total cost of patient activity without procedure and with procedure are 349.10 baht/year/patient and 508.00 baht/year/patient respectively. It shows the influence of usage of activity, the resource used and time increasing between these two service cost.

56,Applying A Genetic Algorithm To A Signboard Layout Problem  Based On A Flow Captured Location-Allocation Problem,"we try to solve a flow-captured location-allocation problem for signboard layout using a genetic algorithm. a facility located at a node of a road network captures the traffic flow passing the node. in this problem, the traffic is assumed to represent demand. the flow-capturing location-allocation model responds to this type of demand and seeks to maximize the one-time exposure of this traffic to facilities. the signboard layout problem is classified as an instance of this problem. kakimoto et al. solved this type of problem using an integer programming approach in the case of charging facilities for electric vehicles in bangkok, thailand. they reported that the location problem cannot be solved if there is a large number of facilities. on the other hand, hodgson et al. compared the performance of exact, vertex substitution and greedy solution procedures. they found that a greedy approach can solve the problem for a large number of facilities. however, the difference between the optimal solution and the greedy solution becomes larger as the number of facilities increases. in this research, we study the possibility of solving the signboard layout problem using a genetic algorithm. this algorithm is a metaheuristic algorithm that can solve large combinatorial optimization problems. we formulate a mathematical model for the problem based on multi-objective optimization, where one objective function minimizes the number of signboards and the other maximizes the traffic flow captured by the signboards. we present the design of the genes, that is, the bit strings that express a solution to the problem. finally, we evaluate the performance using numerical simulation.","location, traffic flow",,"nozomi yoshimura department of computer science and technology salesian polytechnic machida tokyo 194-0215 japan s14553@salesio-sp.ac.jp gaku miyai department of computer science and technology salesian polytechnic machida tokyo 194-0215 japan s14546@salesio-sp.ac.jp yoichi shimakawa department of computer science and technology salesian polytechnic machida tokyo 194-0215, japan simakawa@salesio-sp.ac.jp",
57,Application Of Value Stream Mapping To Improve Financial  Performance Of A Production Floor: A Case Study,"this paper is focused on application of value stream mapping in a production floor of a furniture industry with a view to enhance its performance. analysis of cost is implicated with the value stream maps to secure economic justification. the data was collected from the production floor to develop the current state map from where the non-value added activities and other sources of wastes were investigated and areas of improvements were identified to minimize or eliminate them. incorporating the improvements proposed, this paper suggests a future state map for the upholstery section as well as analysis and result obtained from the application of value stream mapping. the comparative analysis of current and future state map suggests that adapting the concept of lean can repose momentous contribution in the industry by reducing production lead time by 66.67% while lessening the cost by 11.25%. this paper highlights the monetary impact of adaptation of value stream mapping by showing that incorporating lean concept with the utilization of value stream mapping can help industries to provide high customer response with lower costs which is vital to enhance competitive performance in existent market situation.","lean manufacturing, cycle time, production cost","Value stream mapping is an effective Lean tool that helps in the visualization of process under study to address the wastes and areas of improvements to pave the way of attainment of continuous flow from upstream to downstream of production resulting in reduced inventory, production cost and increased efficiency. To provide the industry under study with the favors of this Lean tool, this research attempts to utilize cost based value stream mapping in a real life case of the existing upholstery section of a furniture study and suggestions were proposed to improve process shortcomings. The execution of suggested improvements in the future state map is anticipated to result in 28.69% increase in Process Cycle Efficiency, 24.8% increase in total value added time, 60% decrease in non-value added time and 66.67% decrease in production lead time. In addition to that Cost based analysis is integrated which shows that implementation of future state map will result in 11.25% reduction in total cost on weekly basis. This attempt ascertains the economic viability of the proposed future state map. All these outcomes justifies the efficiency of value stream mapping in collaboration with cost implication in increasing customer response while also offering quality products to customers in relatively low price which enhance performance in competitive market environment. The contribution of this research lies in the justification of financial feasibility of applying value stream mapping tool and incorporating suggested improvements following a systematic framework. The shortcoming of this research is the future state map is based on anticipation rather than application in real life situation. Moreover, in future state map, it was assumed that the employees are willing to adapt Lean and human factors in production were not considered. Some of the cost related data couldn’t be collected accurately and were approximated due to industry policies and regulations. To overcome this limitations, further work can be done in this field by applying the suggested improvements in reality and incorporating simulation for evaluation. Additional focus can be laid on the implications of ergonomics and environmental factors in value stream mapping for better and more advanced outcome. 32420 169776 380950 23054 9020 18400 633620 26483 145250 360047 30586 562366 0 100000 200000 300000 400000 500000 600000 700000 Spring Assembly Foam Pasting Fabric Attachment Fitting(Current Map), Combined Process (Proposed Map) Finishing Packaging Total cost Cost, BDT Process Current Map Proposed Map 797","subrata talapatra and jannatul shefa department of industrial engineering and management khulna university of engineering & technology khulna, bangladesh sub_ksy@yahoo.com, jannatshefa23@gmail.com","References

59,An Ergonomic Design Of Light Rail Transit (Lrt) In The  Philippines For Persons With Special Needs,"the need to improve the quality of transportation for persons with mobility impairment and persons with special needs is a concern, which needs attention. public trains are highly used mode of transportation in the philippines. according to the 2003-2012 transportation statistics, the light rail transit (lrt) transports over 170 million people, of which the train carts are designed only for passengers in healthy state, defying the benefits of public transportation particularly for persons with special needs (psn) such as physically disabled, senior citizens, pregnant women, and passengers with babies or children. the psn represents more than 1.57 percent of lrt’s passenger population. previous researches have focused on the design of public transport for the general public and only a limited amount of research had focused on the design of public transport for persons with special needs. that being so, the researchers aimed to ergonomically design the lrt carts for persons with mobility impairment or special needs such as disabled, elderly, persons carrying children and pregnant women that is fit for use for filipino commuters. the study covered and mainly focused on designing lrt carts including door, seats, aisles, handrails and other features that require mobility aid such as wheelchairs, crutches and canes. in the ergonomic design of lrt carts, factors such as safety, accessibility and comfortability of passengers were considered. the researchers have conducted review of related literature, direct observation, surveys, actual measurements and statistical analyses in order to describe factually and accurately the current design of train carts in the philippines. and through application of ergonomic principles and anthropometry, the researchers have improved the current design of lrt carts with the consideration of the issues of the commuters with mobility impairment and special needs.","ergonomic design, lrt cart, efficient","The findings of the study have proven that the existing design of train carts in the Philippines is not ergonomically designed and fit for Filipino commuters with special needs. This was proven on the result of the RULA and NMDQ analysis of the researchers. The result revealed that users experienced pain and discomfort in different body parts in riding the LRT, which justified the need to redesign and improve current train carts. In the design of train carts, accessibility, comfortability and safety of users were taken into consideration based on the need and requirements of users obtained from Importance-Satisfaction Gap Analysis and Quality Function Deployment. And finally, by applying the principles of anthropometry, the researchers were able to come up with a proposed design of train carts for persons with special needs such as disabled, elderly, person with children and pregnant. The proposed design aims to cater and support the needs of users with mobility impairment in order to achieve comfort and safety when riding the LRT trains in the Philippines.","ma. janice j. gumasing, marion ollie v. zerrudo and josephine d. german school of industrial engineering and engineering management mapua university mjjgumasing@mapua.edu.ph, marionzerrudo@yahoo.com, jdgerman@mapua.edu.ph",
60,Logistic Strategy To Face Disruption In Freight Multimodal  Transportation Network,this paper investigates distribution strategies when facing disruption. this strategy is based on the flexibility in transportation planning through the use of multimodal transportation. the flexibility mode of transportation mode will make it easier to re-plan routes when the system is affected by disruption but usually needs a higher total cost. the development of this model is based on the determining of the delivery route that results in the least total cost and time. the calculation result is intended to compare modes used in either single mode or modal combination in terms of cost and time used.,"logistic, routing, disruptions, multimodal","This paper discusses the logistics strategy (routing) that should be taken when disruption occurs. The utilization of modal flexibility will have an impact on the total time produced longer than those using only one mode because there are several additional processes in it. However, the costs incurred are more minimal. Moreover, when there is disruption on the highway lane, there is a possibility that the total costs incurred are also higher. So in this case, when there is a disruption in the highway, a multimodal strategy is the best strategy that produces the most minimal total costs.

61,A Cross-Sectional Study On Occupational Risk Factors Of  Bpo Agents In The Philippines,"the business process outsourcing (bpo) industry in asia remains to be optimistic in the past years. this is evident in the philippines since the industry is hitting big due to its huge potential workforce that it caters. a large percentage of bpo workers are into telemarketing or call center sub-sector. the total number of persons employed in bpo industry was estimated at 576,000 of which nearly seven out of eight employees (88%) works in the call center subsector. due to increasing demand of call center agents in the country, the reported occupational risks of agents are also apparent. according to recent data from psa (2015), the bpo industry registered a total of 257 cases of occupational injuries. most of the affected workers were employed in call centers (86.4% or 222 cases). call center agents encounter daily stressors from work. researches have shown that call center employees work in a distracting environment. they face high customer expectations and experience pressure to meet company standards. thus, they experience stress as a result of the conflicting demands of the company, managers, co-workers, and customers (ruyter, k., wetzels, m., and feinberg, r., 2001). occupational risk factors have major effect on the stress level of workers. these risk factors affect the health, psychological and job performance of call centers agents. previous researchers on occupational risk factors studied the effects of stress to job performance. however, the effect of occupational risk factors to the stress level based on the coping mechanism and work shift of agents were not yet considered in the study. thus, this paper intends to identify significant risk factors affecting the agents’ overall performance in terms of health condition, psychological condition and job performance and measure the risk level associated with occupational stress of call center agents based on their coping mechanism and work shift. data were gathered from 180 inbound call center agents who work in 3 shifts (opening, middle and closing). results showed that for opening and closing shifts, occupational risk factors affecting the stress level of agents are irregular meal times, noise level, workplace temperature, workplace setup and social life disruption; while for middle shift, risk factors are workplace relationships, number of rest days, irregular mealtimes, social life disruptions and domestic life disruptions. therefore, the identified risk factors affecting stress would serve as the basis for organizations in call center industry to develop stress management programs that would help improve call center agents’ overall performance and wellbeing.","call center agents, stress level, but also","From the result of the analysis in the data obtained from 180 respondents of the study, the following conclusions were drawn: (1) Using regression analysis, it was determined that significant risk factors associated with occupational stress of call center agents were shift rotation, number of rest days, social life disruption, domestic life disruption, irregular sleep, performance demand, irregular mealtimes, workplace relationships, noise level, workplace temperature, and physical setup. While gender and lighting condition were both found to be insignificant causes of stress. (2) The significant risk factors identified using regression analysis were further treated and analyzed in order to determine the effects of significant risk factors to the consequence of stress. Based on the result of correlation analysis, only physical health, mental health, anxiety and poor average handling time (AHT) were considered as the true consequence of stress. (3) Cluster analyses, both K-means and joining clustering were done in order to determine if work shifts differ in terms of significant risk factors affecting health, psychological condition and job performance of call center agents. There were three clusters considered in the study: cluster 1 is composed of the closing shift (3:30am-12:30pm); cluster 2 is composed of the middle shift (10:00pm-7:00am) and cluster 3 is composed of the opening shift (8:00pm-5:00am). Based on the results of K-means Clustering, it was found out that in each of the shifts, the occupational risk factors contributing to stress level of call center agents and the consequence of stress differ. (4) Based on the overall risk level calculation, the risk factors resulting to stress based on coping mechanism of call center agents in each work shift are as follows: (a) closing shift: shift rotation, social life disruption, domestic life disruption, irregular sleep, performance demand, irregular mealtimes, workplace relationships, noise level, and physical setup (b) for middle shift: number of rest days, shift rotation, social life disruption, domestic life disruption, irregular sleep, performance demand, irregular mealtimes, workplace relationships, noise level, and physical setup; and (c) opening shift: number of rest days, shift rotation, social life disruption, irregular sleep, performance demand, irregular mealtimes, workplace relationships, noise level, and physical setup. (5) In order to determine whether the risk levels calculated per cluster or work shift is significantly different, one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s Test were employed. Based on the result, cluster 1 (closing) and cluster 3 (opening) were not significantly different, however, both are significantly different from cluster 2 (middle). The risk levels of each cluster were then ranked in order to determine the occupational risk factors affecting the stress level of call center agents. The results indicated that for cluster 1 (closing) and 3 (opening) shifts, top 5 risk factors affecting stress are irregular meal times, noise level, workplace temperature, workplace setup and social life disruption. For cluster 2 (middle) shift, top 5 risk factors are workplace relationships, number of rest days, irregular mealtimes, social life disruptions and domestic life disruptions. Therefore, the identified risk factors affecting stress would serve as the basis for organizations in call center industry to develop stress management programs that would help improve call center agents’ overall performance and wellbeing. 835","ma. janice j. gumasing and jennifer g. ilagan school of industrial engineering and engineering management mapua university intramuros, manila 1002, philippines mjjgumasing@mapua.edu.ph, rdestember@mapua.edu.ph, mcccarlos@mapua.edu.ph","References

Public urban transport remains inadequate, deficient in quality, and functionally disorganized, particularly in terms of bus-tramway integration in Rabat and Casablanca. Intermodal transport is inefficient, as operators see themselves in competitive rather than complementary roles. Traffic accidents and inadequate access to public transport have disproportionately affected the poor, women and persons with limited mobility. The urban public transport issues are partly the results of weaknesses in governance and a significant underinvestment in the sector. In this paper, we have highlighted the governance problems faced by the Moroccan urban public transport sector in particular the institutional coordination and capacity weaknesses and the lack of a regulatory framework. We also discussed the first reforms initiated by the Moroccan state to improve governance as well as the reasons for failure to implement certain reform actions. We finally describe the target governance model of UPT and presents the progress of the measures taken to achieve it.","zehmed karim and jawab fouad high school of technology (hst) sidi mohamed ben abdellah university (smbau) pb 2427 imouzzer road 30000 ,fez, morocco zehmed.karim@gmail.com, jawabf@gmail.com",
66,A Best Practice Reference Model For Agricultural Supply  Chain For Rice,"in order to cater to the increasing demand of rice, it is necessary to raise the average yield of paddy and quality of paddy significantly through best practices in planning, sourcing and delivery stages of the rice supply chain activities. the choice of reference processes during the design phase is of utmost importance for a paddy supply chains‟ overall performance. applicability of various supply chain reference models in the agriculture domain will be discussed for the purpose of presenting a reference model for the rice sector with existing best practice related to the seed, fertilizer, water, labour and technology factors. in this research main objective is to identify planning and sourcing best practice of the rice supply chain and create best practice reference model as a collaborative tool for the rice sector. the survey was conducted in “pollonnaruwa district” with the participants of farmers and agriculture officers to identify current best practices. the result indicate the presence of key success factor of the rice supply chain still in the initial stage and needs of the operational strategy for fulfillment of the existing gaps of the rice supply chain with best practices.","rice supply chain, best practice, pollonnaruwa, kurunegala","Supply chains not only benefit the sector directly involved, they also stimulate social, economic and environmental sustainable development within a region or country. Supply chain collaboration is of utmost importance for the connection with profitable markets and consumer’s demands, the flow of information, goods, technology and capital and to limit transaction costs. Despite there were few studies of agricultural supply chain networking and collaboration, the planning and sourcing best practices analysis is still not in focus. In this study analysis the current processes of planning and sourcing related to rice supply chain and identify process failure modes and their cause of failure related to Sri Lankan context are tested and discussed the solutions for preventing those failure as planning and sourcing best practices of the rice supply chain. Even though few previous studies are available on this topic this knowledge will be highly useful for farmers, millers, rice consumers, supplier, policy makers and planners in making their decisions. At present, rice sector in Sri Lanka faces a number of constraints related to production, socio economic and policy, technical, institutional and natural resource base. For Sri Lanka to reach, maintain, and even surpass self-sufficiency in rice production, a long term vision, careful planning, innovative research, best management practices, and efficient extension services will be needed. The vertical and horizontal integration and transparency among farmers, millers, researchers, and the government are key features of the rice sectors and shortage of these driving forces for the impressive competitiveness in rice sector generates negative impact for the counties economy.

67,Assessing Service Quality In Healthcare Public Sector: An  Exploratory On Puskesmas,"to achieve competitive advantage, an organization has to measure and improve the quality of its services continuously, leading to customer satisfaction. this also applies to non profit organizations, such as puskesmas, a government owned clinic located in sub-districts. this paper aims to determine the dimensions that can be used to assess the quality of puskemas’ services, so that leveraging factors in order to improve the quality of its services can be identified. the data are collected through surveys, which were conducted at six puskesmases in tangerang to 200 patients. the servqual instrument with a five factor structure is used to assess the quality of the service. data were analyzed not only by descriptive analysis but also by multivariate regression analysis with structural equation modeling (sem). the results showed that the two dimensions of servqual had a significant influence on the quality of service in puskesmas, namely ‘tangibility’ and ‘assurance’. although servqual is able to capture important elements in assesing service quality, it has limitations in the validity of inference. however, this study is still able to provide input for management of puskesmas.","puskesmas, service quality, healthcare, public","The research findings indicate that two dimensions of SERVQUAL, namely ‘tangibility’ and ‘assurance’, are the most important factors in influencing the satisfaction of the patients at puskesmases in Tangerang. This shows that the aspects of ‘tangibility’ and ‘assurance’ are leverage factors to improve the quality of services at puskesmases in Tangerang. The importance of ‘tangibility’ as an important factor influencing the perception of the patients at puskesmas in Tangerang is in line with the research on hospital service quality conducted in Turkey (Çeelik and Sehribanoglu, 2012) and also the research on hospitals conducted in Iran (Zarei et al., 2012). The ‘tangibility’ factor consists of physical appearance, cleanliness and comfort and appearance of employees which are important aspects for improving the quality of services at puskesmas in Tangerang. In addition, the ‘assurance’ is also an important factor that influences the perception of patient at puskesmases in Tangerang. Managing human resource skills, is a leverage factor to improve the quality of Tangerang Public Health services. This is in line with the research on hospitals in Jordan conducted by Al-Hawary et al (2011). Therefore, a puskesmas, as the first level agent for health services for all the people who are administratively domiciled in its working area, should continuously improve the quality of its human resources.","linda theresia industrial engineering department, institut teknologi indonesia indonesia tarlind@yahoo.com ramon bangun retiree from the ministry of industry, republic of indonesia bangun66@yahoo.com",

69,Optimization Model To Enhance The  Petroleum Distribution Network In Sri Lanka,,,,,
70,Distributed Job Scheduling Using Multi-Agent System  Sandeep Kumar And Bhupesh Kumar Lad,"the current paradigm shift in manufacturing, widely known as industry 4.0, exists at the nexus of advances happening in computer science, sensing technologies, information and communication technology, and big data analytics. it brings together internet of things, social networking, and advanced analytics to meet the growing need of personalized production at lower costs, by integrating human-like social capabilities into the assets of an industrial system. in this paper, we propose an innovative multi-agent system based distributed operations planning approach for scheduling of jobs in a parallel machine shop-floor. the approach harnesses the capabilities of cyber- physical systems formed by bringing together physical machines, and various functional divisions, with their cyber space, or agents. these agents interact with one another to form a network of social machines. using distributed decision-making and communications within the network of social assets, we tackle the complex, np-hard problem of job scheduling, and compare the results with that of conventional centralized operations planning approach. the advantages of the proposed approach are clear in terms of reduction in computation time and lateness, and the flexibility offered by the distributed approach.","multi-agent system, job scheduling","and Future Work This paper proposes an innovative Multi-Agent System based distributed operations planning approach for scheduling of jobs in a parallel machine shop-floor. The approach is demonstrated for various cases. Each case is solved by the proposed distributed approach and conventional centralized approach to compare the results. Here, two different optimization techniques Adaptive Thermo-statistical Simulated Annealing (ATSA) and brute force are utilized for optimization. The proposed distributed approach utilizes cyber-physical-systems, parallel computing and communication capabilities of various agents (machine and PPC). This is one of the essential requirements of decision-making in smart factories under Industry 4.0. For complex problems, distributed approach provides best solution in least computation time. Therefore, distributed approach can be one of the alternatives for shop-floor operations planning for next generation manufacturing systems. In an event of failure, sudden surge in demand, or any other disturbance the system can go for rescheduling of jobs. This is made possible by the highly reduced computation time. The future prospects are two-fold. First, to resemble the real-world manufacturing shop-floor more closely, the number of components of the machines can be increased and the processing times of the jobs can be different for different machines.

72,Designing Supervisory Policies That Avoid Livelocks In  Manufacturingand Service-Systems Modeled Using,"when a manufacturing- or service-system gets into a deadlocked state none of the activities can proceed towards completion. when the same system is in a livelocked state, some activity of the system enters a state of suspended animation and is never completed, while other activities proceed to completion without hindrance. a livelock-free system does not experience deadlocks; but a deadlock-free system can experience livelocks. this tutorial is about the synthesis of livelock avoidance policies for manufacturing- and service-systems that are modeled by petri nets (pns). after characterizing livelock-freedom, we introduce the paradigm of liveness enforcing supervisory policies (lesps). an lesp is said to be minimally restrictive, if the fact that it prevents the occurrence of an event at a given state is reason enough to infer that all livelock-avoidance policies would do the same. if there is an lesp for a system, there is a unique minimally restrictive lesp. we restrict attention to lesps that can be implemented using a disjunctive normal form (dnf) expression on the state of the pn modeling the system. we describe the process of synthesizing the minimally restrictive lesps using an illustrative example using a software-product developed by the authors.",service systems,"Using an illustrative example we described how the operations in a manufacturing- or service-systems could be modeled using Petri nets. These systems are prone to livelocks, where an activity never progresses to completion, while the other activities proceed normally. We showed how a livelock avoidance policy could be synthesized for these systems using a software tool from the literature.

73,A New Approach For Classifying Cross-Functional Teams In  Product Development Projects,"developing a complex product in a concurrent engineering environment requires managing information flow among ten or even hundreds of people of different specialties organized in a large number of cross-function product development (pd) teams. this paper proposes an approach based on centrality measures in social networks for modeling and analyzing the information flows among pd teams. one advantage of this approach is that it enables pd project managers to identity the key pd teams based on a proposed new classification system that classifies pd teams under four categories: autonomous, receivers, transmitters, and transceivers. a demonstrative example adapted from the literature is presented.",information flows,"Modeling and analyzing information flows among PD teams is a challenging issue for PD projects. Design structure matrix and social networks analysis were found to be most commonly used tools in the literature. Taking into account some limitations of previous relevant studies, this paper presented an approach for modeling information flows among PD teams consisting of three major steps: mapping interdependencies, network visualization and then classifying the PD teams according to their in-degree and out-degree centrality values into four categories—autonomous, receivers, 907","hamdi bashir department of industrial engineering and engineering management sustainable engineering asset management (seam) research group university of sharjah sharjah, uae hbashir@sharjah.ac.ae","References

74,Modeling And Analyzing Interrelationships Among Project  Success Factors And Criteria,"previous studies have identified and modeled various factors affecting project success in the construction industry. however, in order to design and implement an effective program for achieving project success, it is necessary to integrate all the identified success factors (sfs) and their links to success criteria (scs) into a single comprehensive model. this was accomplished in this study by using social network analysis, in which 19 sfs and 9 scs were represented by a comprehensive graphical model. this model was complemented with a cross-impact matrix multiplication applied to classification (micmac) analysis in order to classify sfs and scs in terms of their driving powers and dependence levels. accordingly, the key factors for project success have been identified as effective project team formation, effective communication, support from top management, clearly defined goals and objectives, and the project manager’s competence.","success factors, success criteria, social network","Decision makers should be aware of not only the relative importance of the various SFs and their direct impact on SCs, but also the relationships among them. Based on the results reported previously in the literature and on expert opinions, 19 SFs and their interrelationships with 9 SCs were identified and used to build a comprehensive graphical model using social network analysis. As a complement to this model, a MICMAC analysis was performed to classify the modeled variables based on their driving powers and dependence levels. Three clusters of SFs and SCs were identified: a cluster of autonomous variables, a cluster of dependent variables, and a cluster of independent variables. Accordingly, effective project team formation, effective communication, support from top management, clearly defined goals and objectives, and the project manager’s competence are the keys to project success. Therefore, project managers should pay special attention to these SFs, since otherwise, any efforts towards achieving success would be futile. The present study can be extended in several ways. In particular, future research may consider modeling and analyzing the interrelationships among SFs and SCs in projects in other industries. Using fuzzy interrelationships instead of binary interrelationships may also be considered in future studies.","gordian udechukwu ojiako, anwar hamdan, and hamdi bashir department of industrial engineering and engineering management college of engineering, university of sharjah sharjah, uae gojiako@sharjah.ac.ae, anwar.hamdan@sharjah.ac.ae, hbashir@sharjah.ac.ae",
75,Structuring Project Interdependencies Into A Simple  Graphical Hierarchical Model,"several methods and tools have been developed to support managing project portfolios. however, despite the increasing attention on project portfolio management (ppm) over the last decade from both academic and practitioners, very few methods and tools have been proposed for modeling dependencies among projects within a portfolio. for better visualizing interdependencies among projects, this paper proposes to apply interpretive structural modeling (ism) for structuring project interdependencies into a simple graphical hierarchical model. for demonstration, this method is applied to a portfolio consisting of 22 interdependent projects.",visual tools,"Investigating interdependency between projects is a challenging field in PPM practice. Optimization models and visual tools are considered methods and tools that utilize interdependencies within a portfolio. Visual PPM tools are believed to illustrate a better understanding of the interdependencies between projects. However, the existing PPM visual tools have some drawbacks relating to project roadmaps, the dependency matrix, the nested options model, and visual project maps. Project roadmapping is a basic model to visualize projects and produce detail overload. While the nested options model is valid for small project portfolios, the dependency matrix does not present multilevel or accumulated project interdependencies. Moreover, visual project mapping is often very complex, and it is difficult to trace the interdependencies among the projects. To overcome these limitations, the ISM is implemented in this study to convert the complex graph used for visualizing project interdependencies into a simpler graphical hierarchical graph. The benefits of using the ISM methodology were presented through an illustrative example of a project portfolio consisting of 22 interdependent projects. The ISM methodology arranged the projects in a hierarchical structure model including five levels that was simpler than VPM. The ISM model arranges the bottom level of the hierarchy (projects: M, E, U, X, A, I and O) as the more important projects based on their interdependency within the portfolio. The outcome of the ISM model can help decision makers to pay attention to bottom level, middle level, and then top level projects. Cancelling, delaying, or significantly altering any one of the bottom level projects will have negative effects on many projects in the portfolio. Moreover, middle level projects are the most difficult projects to manage, since they depend on many other projects, while many other projects depend on them at the same time. Top level projects do not have much interdependency within the portfolio. Finally, in addition to the ISM model used in this study, other methods would likely be useful for understanding the interdependencies of a project portfolio. The other methods could be used as complementary tools along with the ISM method for analyzing interdependences from different perspectives. This could be explored in a future study.

76,The Influence Of Customer’S Belief About E-Service Delivery  Process On Behavioral Intentions: The Mediating Role Of,"service organizations are looking for ways to better deliver services through use of information and communication technology and to increase customers’ intention to use that service provider again. service providers can differentiate themselves by making perception of their service delivery process effective and efficient. past research shows that customer’s belief about service delivery process impacts the attitude towards the service provider leads to intension to use service providers in future. this study adopts the belief-attitude-intension (b-a-i) model regarding e-service delivery process in online retailing context. for belief about e-service delivery from customers’ perspective, five constructs are considered i.e. perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, perceived flexibility, perceived control, and perceived risk. with data collected from a sample of 442 indian e-tail customers, this research uses mediated regression to examine the influence of customer’s belief about e-service delivery process on consumers’ behavioral intentions, and the mediating role attitude towards service provider plays in the relationship. the findings indicate that all five belief constructs are associated with behavioral intentions to use service provider again in future and that attitude towards service provider partially mediates the relationship for all five belief’s constructs. the implications for theory and practice are discussed. this study suggested what customers’ belief are important in a service delivery process and contributes managerial implications.","b-a-i model, online retail",,"attitude in a b-a-i model piyush gupta and amit sachan indian institute of management ranchi ranchi, 834008, india piyush.gupta15fpm@iimranchi.ac.in, amitsachan@iimranchi.ac.in",
77,Corporate Sustainable Development Performance  Measurement: A Systematic Review And Proposal Of An,"interest in measuring corporate sustainable development performance has increased considerably in recent years. efforts to define, quantify, and measure progress in sustainable development have contributed to the development of a wide variety of indicators, expressed in technical language, and targeting the multi-dimensional aspects of sustainable development. such interest has favored the emergence of various organizations specialized in sustainable development performance measurement and the development of an ever-increasing number of international standards and indices. examples of such standards include the global reporting initiative (gri), the pacific sustainability index (psi), the dow jones sustainability index (djsi), the corporate sustainability index (ise) supported by the world bank group, the sustainability accounting standards board (sasb), iso 26000, iso 14001, total and ford indicators grids, un global compact, etc. in addition, over the last decade, an overwhelming number of scientific publications have suggested a variety of indicators for corporate sustainability performance assessment in different industrial contexts. in the same vein, many governments have also worked hard to identify indicators and set targets for measuring progress on sustainable development. the objective of this paper is twofold. first, this paper exposes the results of a systematic review covering both professional and scientific literature. second, it draws up an inventory of sd indicators and proposed an indicator grid specific to manufacturing companies. these indicators will allow i) to monitor and measure the impacts of the manufacturing company's sustainable activities, ii) to facilitate comparisons and rankings between companies, iii) to improve communication with stakeholders (fiorino, 2006; perrini & tencati, 2006), iv) to inform decision-making processes (perrini and tencati, 2006) and v) to offer companies (whether or not engaged in sustainable development activities) assist them in selecting relevant and appropriate actions for sustainable development. in terms of results, a systematic review of the scientific literature and the professional standards was conducted. on one hand, 610 articles were collected for the period 2007-2017 and a detailed analysis was carried out on 141 articles dealing with sustainability performance assessment for manufacturing companies. on the other hand, 7 standards and their associated indicators were analyzed (gri, iso-16000, djsi / rebecosam, uqac grid, united nations, ford psi, total). results in terms of indicators provided by the scientific literature and the standards were confronted. they show that novel sub-dimensions and aspects, not yet included in the existing standards, emerged from the 928",,,"indicator grid for manufacturing companies anissa frini department of management science university of quebec at rimouski, campus of lévis 1595, boulevard alphonse-desjardins lévis (québec) canada g6v 0a6 email: anissa_frini@uqar.ca dominique diouf centre d’étude en responsabilité sociale et écocitoyenneté (cérsé) collège rosemont, montréal, canada chaire du canada sur l’internalisation du développement durable et la responsabilisation des organisations department of management, laval university, quebec, canada dominique.diouf@gmail.com",
78,Modelling The Effects Of Friction On Tool-Chip Interface  Temperature During Orthogonal Cutting Of Al6061-T6,"in this work, finite element simulations based on the analytical model derived with the matlab software were used to establish the temperature fields within the cutting tool and tool-chip interface. the average tool-chip interface temperature model was simulated and the simulation results were compared with experimental results for validation. at a maximum cutting speed of 90 m/min, the maximum temperature obtained from the experiment was 410 oc, at same rake angle of 0 o. however, the developed model predicted 490 oc under the same conditions. the higher value obtained by the model can be attributed to the negligence of heat losses to the surrounding by both convection and radiation modes, as an assumption in the formulated model. a similar trend of these results was also recorded for the case of rake angle and feed rate of 30 o and 0.0635 mm/rev, respectively. it was observed that the simulation results and experimental measurements for the average tool-chip interface temperature agreed significantly.","friction, finite element",,"aluminium alloy sunday joshua ojolo, sikiru oluwarotimi ismail and kelechi ogbuanu department of mechanical engineering university of lagos akoka-yaba, lagos, nigeria sojolo@unilag.edu.ng, sismail@unilag.edu.ng",

Changes in heat treatment altered the alloy microstructure especially the grain boundaries morphologies through the development of voids triangular geometry that led to reduced strength both tensile and fatigue life. Stress-strain curves exhibited an initial regime of linear elastic behavior for both as received and annealed INCONEL601 alloys with yield strength approximately 370MPa followed by plastic deformation. The plastic region exhibited differences in behavior. The as received INCONEL601 alloy revealed higher strength than annealed INCONEL601 alloy with a value of 785 and 775MPa respectively.

Two types of interdependencies among projects-mutual exclusiveness and complementariness are considered. The most beneficial projects are selected in the portfolio and are scheduled simultaneously. The total expected benefit is considered as the objective function to be optimized. The benefits from the projects are considered to be time-dependent. The problem is formulated in the form of a 0-1 integer program. A modified genetic algorithm (GA) is developed, and performance is compared with the Tabu Search (TS) algorithm existing in the PPSSP literature. Both the algorithms are evaluated on a set of 15 randomly generated test problems with varying complexity. The results show that proposed GA outperforms the TS algorithm in 10 test problems out of the total 15 problems generated in this study. As a major contribution of this work, the developed algorithm promises a potential solution approach to tackle the large and real life project selection problems faced by various organizations. For future research, the problem can be extended to consider the multiple objective and dynamic selection and scheduling of projects.","manish kumar, m l mittal, gunjan soni and dheeraj joshi department of mechanical engineering malaviya national institute of technology jaipur, india m81manishkumar@gmail.com, mlmittal.mech@mnit.ac.in, gsoni.mech@mnit.ac.in, dheerajjoshi25@gmail.com",

89,A Study Of The Implications Of Logistics 4.0 In Future  Warehousing: A Sri Lankan Perspective,"an effective combination of highly innovative logistics infrastructure plays a vital role in every business activity as a strategy of achieving competitive advantage. currently, warehousing has been identified as one of the foremost value adding activities in supply chains. in the warehousing industry, automated intralogistics systems would be an ideal solution to eliminate the inefficiencies in conventional practices as well as to overcome the labour shortage issue. with the emergent trend of technology adaptation in industries, it is evident that sri lanka has the capability to apply these technologies up to a certain extent. therefore, discovering the opportunities of logistics 4.0 implementation in sri lankan warehousing industry is highly demanding. this scrutiny has been conducted using a comprehensive and systematic review of literature published in relation to the areas of smart warehousing, smart logistics, intralogistics and sri lankan third party logistics (3pl) industry. through the effective categorization and integrative analysis, this paper intends to identify the ways of warehousing process improvements using the logistics 4.0 technologies while achieving the operational excellence. further, it is expected to suggest the critical success factors affecting the logistics 4.0 implementation from the perspective of sri lankan 3pl warehousing industry.","logistics 4.0, smart logistics, smart warehouse, intralogistics","There is no hesitation that the logistics performance adds value to the entire supply chain in the organization. Companies have identified logistics as one of key success factors in obtaining competitive advantage. Outsourcing the logistics functions to a third party has become a common practice in the corporate world. Therefore, the 3PL service providers perform a vital role in the current context of Sri Lankan Logistics sector and they have become the experts in providing a wide range of services such as warehousing services, transportation services, inventory management, shipping etc. Hence, the 3PL service providers make a significant contribution to the country’s economy, because they allow most of the organizations to achieve their goals through enhancing the performance of their supply chains. Nonetheless, these 3PL firms have been encountering some major challenges due to the lack of some capabilities. One such critical challenge is the labour shortage. The digitization will be an effective strategy to overcome above challenge to minimize human intervention and enhance the output of the available labour force. In this study, the attention has been mainly focused on the intralogistics processes of warehousing. Optimization of the warehousing operations is becoming challenging for the 3PL firms to cope up with the dynamic customer demand and market features. The application of logistics 4.0 concepts in to the intra-logistics processes would be an ideal solution to overcome these issues. It is evident that there is a possibility to foster digitization in Sri Lanka by promoting digital infrastructure, investing and stimulating professional training and promoting the creation of specific funding lines and etc. “Industry 4.0-related opportunities and challenges have a significant influence on its tendency towards implementation” (Müller, Kiel and Voigt 2018).

90,A New Layout Problem For Order-Picking Warehouses  Ömer Öztürkoğlu,"recent studies of warehouse layout designs show that the travel distance for order-picking operations can be reduced by changing the angle of the cross aisles in the traditional warehouse layout. thus, in this study, a new design idea is proposed to search for better layouts for order-picking operations than traditional two-block layouts. for this, two angled cross aisles are allowed to intersect in the middle of the storage area. a new constructive aisle model is developed so as to evaluate all possible layouts that can be generated in this problem. in order to calculate order picking tour length for a given number of visits, one of the best known metaheuristics algorithm called ant colony optimization algorithm is used. next, differential evolution algorithm is used to explore the best values of the design variables to minimize average order-picking tour length for a given number of orders. last, it was shown that two- block layouts are superior to the best-found designs with two angled and intersected cross aisles under the considered design assumptions in this study.","warehouse design, order-picking, aisle design, randomized storage",,"department of business administration yaşar university izmir, turkey omer.ozturkoglu@yasar.edu.tr ayşegül mağara schneider electric izmir, turkey aysegul.magara@gmail.com","References

92,Decentralization Of Medical Emergency Service   To Minimize Response Time,"medical emergency service (mes) is an important element in modern healthcare system. mes becomes important issue because it plays an important role in saving lives and reducing mortality and mordibility. the ability of mes to save lives depends on the time it takes for an ambulance to arrive on the scene after an emergency call received. this research will focus on changing the mes system from initially centralized to decentralized by considering the determination of the allocation and redeployment of ambulance. we propose the nearest neighbourhood – symbiotic organisms search algorithm (nn-sos) to overcome the problems. this study is expected to be able to solve the problems in the limitation of the number of ambulance required and the minimization of response time. from this study, it can be concluded that a decentralized ambulance system is needed. the comparison of the response time generated from the two systems is a centralized system with the best time limit having an average response time of 10-13 minutes while the decentralized system is better which is 3-6 minutes. keyword : ambulance allocation and redeployment, decentralized, medical emergency service, response time 1. introduction in medical emergency services, the response time is the interval between the arrival of the emergency call and the arrival of the medical team at the location of the call. this is a major concern because this delay may cause a difference between the patient's life and death, depending on the seriousness of his medical condition. mes managers must take operational and tactical decisions in this system to evaluate trade-offs between providing appropriate patient care (service level) and reducing costs associated with medical resources and capacity (ambulances, stations, specialties and equipment) (de souza et al ., 2015). the performance of pre-hospital medical (mes) emergency services depends on existing transportation infrastructure and medical resources (limited and important). the ambulance response time is generally considered an important factor for the survival of mes patients. especially for patients with urgent needs, the response time determines the mortality rate (chen et al., 2016). one key factor in mes performance is the speed at which emergency vehicles can respond to incidents (mccormarck & coates 2015). the main objective of mes is to save the lives of emergency 1072",,"From this study, it can be concluded that a decentralized ambulance system is needed. This is because it facilitates the request to get an ambulance. We cannot expect emergency conditions so that at least we can do prevention by using such solutions. To choose the best time limit that will be set as the standard of each system judging by how fast the response time is generated and how much the system is able to meet the demand. The best time limit for ambulances can serve patients on a centralized system, which is 15 minutes with an average speed of 50 minutes assuming nothing when heading to the destination, while the best time limit for a decentralized system is 8.8 minutes. The comparison of the response time generated from the two systems is a centralized system with the best time limit having an average response time of 10-13 minutes while the decentralized system is better which is 3-6 minutes.","muhammad isnaini hadiyul umam, diva kurnianingtyas doctoral student of industrial engineering department institut teknologi sepuluh nopember surabaya, 60111, indonesia isnaini.30@gmail.com, divakurnianingtyas@gmail.com budi santosa, nurhadi siswanto department of industrial engineering institut teknologi sepuluh nopember surabaya, 60111, indonesia budi_s@ie.its.ac.id, siswanto@ie.its.ac.id",
93,"Coalescing The Lean And Circular Economy  Simon Peter Nadeem, Jose Arturo Garza-Reyes, Anthony I Anosike","growing population along with technological advancement to pace the production speed like never before has raised alarming concerns and attracted attention globally. circular economy, a fairly new concept has emerged to address such issues by proposing a closed loop system in contrast to a linear system. while the concept of circular economy presents a great potential, there yet remain a challenge for its adaptation in the existing manufacturing sector, especially at smes level. many new techniques, methods and models are being developed, many of which require a complete change in the existing system, which not only have capital requirements but also upskilling labour. for smes, it is challenging to have such transition due to higher capital and skills requirements. this research explores the possibility to combine the existing concept of lean with circular economy for speedy and easy adaptation of circular economy principles within the manufacturing sector, especially at smes level. a novel conceptually developed framework is proposed to merge the vitality of lean and circular economy.","circular economy, lean",,"centre for supply chain improvement, university of derby, derby, u.k. s.nadeem@derby.ac.uk, j.reyes@derby.ac.uk, a.anosike@derby.ac.uk vikas kumar bristol business school, university of the west of england, bristol, u.k. vikas.kumar@uwe.ac.uk","References

94,Multi-Period Temporary Depot Location Problem In  Flood Natural Disaster Response,"because the formation or reformation of emergency logistics is a complex undertaking, this study proposes a multi-period location-routing model in the immediate aftermath of a flood natural disaster. the model can decide the temporary depot locations and make vehicle routing plans in which the amount of each relief supplies to be transported can be optimally determined. the temporary depot considered in this problem is a facility different from a typical warehouse on the fact that temporary depots are not set up to provide storage, but are created instead to facilitate transferring relief supplies from one carrier type to another carrier type at the flood boundary. the most common transport means used in the real flood problem, trucks and boats, are considered in the model formulation. we begin by explaining the proposed mixed-integer programming model which employs a dynamic approach to locate the temporary depots, after which we conduct a set of numerical experiments to test the model formulation and analyze the characteristics of the optimization problem. the experimental results indicate that, based on flood disaster characteristics, our model is capable of showing the optimal locations of temporary depots in the flood response operations.","multi-period model, temporary depot","The study extended the contribution focusing on the operational level in the immediate aftermath of a flood natural disaster. The location-routing model is proposed to the particular temporary depot problem regards to a multi-period approach. The model can decide the temporary depot locations and make vehicle routing plans in which the amount of each relief supplies to be transported can be optimally determined. The temporary depot considered in this problem is a facility different from a typical warehouse on the fact that temporary depots are not set up to provide storage, but are created instead to facilitate transferring relief supplies from one carrier type to another carrier type at the flood boundary. The most common transport means used in the real flood problem, trucks and boats, are considered in the model formulation. We demonstrate illustrative examples that present how the model formulation can be used to optimize the locations of temporary depots by the first three days of emergency response. More number of resources are able to provide better response that can complete the satisfaction faster than the small number of available resources. The proposed model shows the optimal locations of temporary depots for each time period regarding to demand in floods. The approach is referred as a valuable tool for the decision maker that suggest the plan for locating and relocating temporary facilities for each time period in order to provide the optimal response delivery. Though, there are a number of research expansion of this study, future research will seek for more complex and larger problems. The application of a heuristic algorithm is prospected to offer opportunities for better improvement when sizes and complexity of problem become greater. This can be expected to help finding proper and satisfactory solutions to problem processes.","wapee manopiniwes department of industrial engineering, faculty of engineering chiang mai university chiang mai, thailand wapee.m@cmu.ac.th takashi irohara faculty of science and technology sophia university tokyo, japan irohara@sophia.ac.jp",
95,Developing A Roadmap To Become A World Class  Manufacturing Company: A Case Of Process Industry In,"the purpose of this study is to develop a framework for implementation of world-class manufacturing (wcm) in process industry which can guide and support for those process industries, aiming to start their journey to reach world-class standards in quality. world class manufacturing (wcm) includes various concepts, principles, policies and techniques for the management and operation of companies engaged in production in order to achieve competitive edge over competitors. the case study presented in this paper is from one of the india’s largest crop protection chemical company which has set a target of bagging deming prize in next 5 years through tqm. the organizations applying for deming prize should achieve a business success through quality improvements. the various tools of tqm such as policy management, daily work management, autonomous maintenance, and lean manufacturing are discussed. in order to implement wcm in a process industry, this study gives a broader overview of wcm through tqm. with the context of wcm implementation in a process industry, the study is considered to be valuable and useful to the practitioners.",,"3.6. Lean Manufacturing (LM) The philosophy of manufacturing pioneered by Toyota was termed as lean manufacturing by James Womack and Daniel Jones (1991) in the book The machine that changed the world. Lean manufacturing facilitates the production of artifacts in medium-to-large volume and a medium-to-large variety and hence enables to meet the requirements of a broad customer base. The basic concept of lean is to eliminate waste by addressing the material and information flow issues in a production system and makes it more efficient and competitive (Chaple et al. 2018a). Commonly referred wastes include overproduction, inventory, waiting, over-processing, transportation, motion and defects. Researchers have reported various benefits of lean manufacturing like, reduced waste, rework, space requirement, lot size, inventory, overhead cost and improved quality, motivation, process yields, productivity, flexibility and problem- solving capabilities (Jayaram et al., 2008; Hofer et al., 2012). Within the process industry, chemical sector is under continuing pressure on the cost. However, lean has been the perfect strategy to apply to reduce cost. ‘Performance improvements across the whole supply chain supporting increased business performance’ is obvious offering of what ‘lean’ has to the process industries (Melton, 2005). LM is a multi-dimensional approach that encompasses a wide variety of management practices in an integrated system. Researchers have discussed a wide variety of lean practices in improving the business performance. Lean practices are those actions that focus on the reduction of waste and non-value-added activities (e.g. overproduction, inventory or any other factor) that can disrupt the swift-even flow of goods through the supply chain, from a firm’s internal manufacturing operations (Chaple et al., 2018b). 3.7. Performance measures (PQCDSM) Performance measures are a metric used to quantify the efficiency and/or effectiveness of an action (Neely et al. 1995; Chaple et al. 2018a). Performance measures help in monitoring, achieving goals, benchmarking, and deciding strategies for corrective actions. It is reported that organizations that fail to measure the most critical areas for its success are less likely to achieve their strategic objectives. In measuring the benefits of implementing improvement initiatives, researchers have discussed a variety of performance measure, such as, productivity, quality, cost, delivery, safety and morale which are adopted to monitor improvements through WCM. 4. Conclusions WCM is sustainable business excellence model driven by customer centric goals, people and partners. The case study presented in this paper intends to explain the implementation framework of World-Class Manufacturing (WCM) in process industry which can guide and support for those process industries, aiming to start their journey to reach world- class standards in total quality management (TQM). The various tools of TQM were then summarized and explained, such as policy management, daily work management, autonomous maintenance, and lean manufacturing. In the context of WCM implementation in a process industry, the study is considered to be valuable and useful to the practitioners as it first a) Brings stability in processes and reduces variations, then b) Takes system and processes to next level applying SDCA- PDCA cycle continuously, and overall c) Profitable business goal achievement as the effect of robust system and processes. 1108","india dr. anup p. chaple manager – industrial engineering upl ltd. india anup.chaple@gmail.com, anup.chaple@uniphos.com sanjay dharajiya lead- world class manufacturing upl limited, india smdharajiya@yahoo.co.in, dharajiyasm@uniphos.com","References

96,"Present Scenarios Of Energy Utilization In Bangladesh  Mohammad Iqbal1, Farhad Hawlader2, And Salma Akhter3","natural gas is the most important indigenous source of energy that has been continuously produced and consumed in significant quantities since 19470.about 75% of the commercial energy of the country comes from the natural gas. so far 27 gas fields have been discovered of which two of the gas fields are located in offshore area. the paper shows the dependency of bangladesh on gas alone and negligence on other resources like coal, solar, wind, biomass etc. though bangladesh has considerable amount of gas yet it is not enough for 50 more years at current demand and extraction rate. the analysis suggests to reduce dependency on natural gas by introducing alternative energy sources. moreover, a comprehensive energy policy should be developed with a proper regulatory body that has oversight responsibilities. efficient gas marketing is the key to derive numerous benefits from the gasreserves of bangladesh. lastly, bangladesh government need to explore ocean area that has been acquired from india & myanmar in 2014. 1. introduction though the serious attempt to find oil and natural gas started in the first decade of previous century, the first gas field discovery was made by pakistan petroleum limited (ppl) in 1955 at haripur. but the rapid expansion and integration of petroleum companies started to accelerate in the early 1970s spurred by the rising oil prices. the last (26th) discovery was in roopganj (narayanganj) in june, 2014.natural gas is the most important fuel for bangladesh, both in terms of energy and diversity of use. natural gas burns more cleanly than other fuels, such as oil and coal, and produces less carbon dioxide per unit of energy released. for an equivalent amount of heat, burning natural gas produces about 30% less carbon-dioxide than burning petroleum and about 45% less than burning coal.bangladesh oil, gas and mineral resources corporation, petrobangla, is entrusted with the responsibilities of the gas and coal sectors of bangladesh. subsidiaries under petrobangla are responsible for exploration, production, transmission, distribution and marketing of natural gas to the end users.in 1993, there were 17 gas fields in the country with an estimated total initial gas reserve of 12.43 tcf and remaining reserves of 10.55 tcf. in 2003, the number of gas fields was 22 and the total initial gas reserve was estimated at 20.51 tcf and a remaining reserve of 15.4 tcf. in 2014, the number of gas fields grew to 26 with an estimated initial gas reserve of 26.84 tcf and a remaining reserve of 16.74 tcf. in 2016, remaining gas reserve is 12.88 tcf [1]. bangladesh also has good amount of coal along with natural gas as its main resources reserved in its territory. but the extensive portion of the demand is met by gas alone and it is about 75% of the total consumptions. 1111",,"This study examined the current energy mix, present energy crisis and its way to overcome such scenario by utilizing alternative energy sources such as LNG, nuclear energy, biogas, solar, wind and small-scale hydropower energy in the context of Bangladesh. A contemporary scenario of Bangladesh’s renewable energy sector has been presented. The study shows Bangladesh dependency on gas alone and negligence on other resources. The analysis suggests reducing the dependency on natural gas by introducing alternative energy resources and exploring new gas fields in ocean areas.","1department of industrial and production engineering iqbal_ipe@yahoo.com 2department of petroleum and mining engineering 3department of chemical engineering and polymer science shahjalal university of science and technology, sylhet, bangladesh engr. sumayelmuhamad mallik4 uiversal yarn dyeing ltd.h#445, r#07,baridhara dohs, dhaka-1206,bangladesh sumayelmallik@gmail.com. a. rashid5 4department of mechanical and chemical engineering islamic university of technology, gazipur, dhaka, bangladesh a_rashid@iut-dhaka.edu",

Wickramarachchi","with the rapid industrialization that swarmed across the globe in the past few decades, various environmental issues have emerged due to negligence of humans. hence, in the recent history people across the globe have joined together in minimizing the environmental impacts from industrial activities. special concern has been placed on the logistics arena of the supply chain leading to a shift in the traditional objectives of vehicle routing problem (vrp) towards the minimization of environmental impacts from distribution. the new branch of vrp that emerged is known as green vehicle routing problem (vrp) and consists of three predominantly identified categories as green-vrp, pollution routing problem and vrp in reverse logistics. in nowadays, a high concern is placed on the management of reverse logistic flows in the supply chain for minimizing the adverse environmental impacts and thus requires a proper optimization in the distribution channels associated with this process. this literature review extensively analyses the available literature in vrp in reverse logistics to identify the current trends, limitations in the applicability to real world and the available research gaps. hence it is hoped that the article will provide guidance for future researches.","green logistics, reverse logistics",,"department of industrial management, university of kelaniya, sri lanka erangiwaidyathilaka@gmail.com, kasuniv@kln.ac.lk, ruwan@kln.ac.lk","References

98,Technology-Driven Lpg Supply Chain Integration – A Case  Of Pakistan,"pakistan has a wide network of gas pipelines supplying natural gas to domestic, commercial, industrial and power production sectors. due to its capital-intensive nature, many newly developed urban areas, most of suburban localities, hilly areas in the north and rural areas across pakistan are not connected to the gas network. households and commercial activities requiring gas in areas disconnected from natural gas supply, therefore, depend mainly on liquid petroleum gas (lpg) cylinders for different purposes. of the total requirement in pakistan, about 40 to 45 percent is imported and the remaining requirement is fulfilled through domestic production. about 150 oil and marketing companies have the license to import and sell lpg to all sectors across pakistan. large consumers of lpg are catered directly or through outsourced distributors by these oil marketing companies. households and commercial users, constituting mainly smaller consumers but significantly large in numbers, are served through mostly illegal decanters who get their supplies through distributors. apart from legal issues, this network poses serious problems vis-à-vis standard safety procedures in testing, decanting and supply of lpg cylinders. moreover, there is a host of issues that the domestic and small scale commercial users of lpg cylinders face. first, for the lack of reliable lpg volume detection in cylinders, sometimes users run out of gas while the cylinder is in use, and the consumers may have to face problems in case ‘safety stock’ is not available. second, special arrangements e.g., of carriage and transport, which may not always be convenient, have to be made for bringing cylinders to decanter. moreover, gas cylinder decanting is usually only possible during specific hours and if cylinder decanting is required at some odd time of the day, the consumers may have to face availability issues too. this article presents an ingenious solution to the highlighted problems, which are essentially related to supply chain integration issues of optimal stock level, demand forecasting, order penetration point, and logistics. during an undergraduate capstone project, a smart scale equipped with a microcontroller, a load sensor and a gsm module was developed. the device was programmed to send periodic messages about lpg level based on weight on load sensor, allowing to estimate lpg level and hence detection of demand even before the need arises. order penetration point was thus shifted upstream for the supplier enabling a timely and efficient delivery to all such consumers within a certain geographic zone. if conceived properly, through introduction of distributor directly from legal oil and gas marketing companies to the end consumer, the device may allow elimination of a complete tier of illegal decanters along with their profit margins, increase the profits of main suppliers, possibly reduced cost to consumers, and also help in near accurate demand forecasting.","lpg supply chain, demand forecasting",,"farhan daud qazi and ijaz ahmad chaudhry industrial engineering department school of engineering university of management and technology lahore, pakistan farhan.qazi@umt.edu.pk, ijaz.ahmad@umt.edu.pk omar zaid production manager hadeed pakistan pvt. limited, sheikhupura, pakistan omarzaid@gmail.com",

100,A Model For Assessing Maturity Of Industry 4.0 In The  Banking Sector,"recent technological advancements have resulted a paradigm shift in the transition from physical world to a virtual world in many industrial scenarios. thus, the development of the concept of industry 4.0 revolutionize the way of conducting businesses. the applications of industry 4.0 are rapidly growing in the financial sector as well. as modern customer expectations have risen with the technology improvements, they value relationship centric experience that hinges on trust and personalization while receiving unlimited accessibility, convenience and speed of service. this will challenge banks to deliver their services strategy by enabling advanced technologies. accordingly, there is an essential need to define, formulate a set of guidelines or a basis for evaluating the progress of the current state of the operational processes of banking sector in the journey of adapting industry 4.0. this study proposes a maturity model to assess level of readiness in adapting to industry 4.0 of the banking sector. the proposed maturity model consists of five maturity levels namely: initial, managed, defined, established and digital oriented. the maturity of the bank was assessed based on seven dimensions and its explanatory factors. this scrutiny will provide a comprehensive review of literature in the fields of industry 4.0, its applications in the banking sector and its maturity models.","industry 4.0, banking 4.0, maturity model","and Future Work The purpose of this study is to develop and assess a maturity model to understand industry 4.0 maturity level of the banking sector. Thus it acts as a guidance tool over the journey of industry 4.0 adaptation. Assessment of the maturity of industry 4.0 is important for the banking sector in order to identify current capacity as well as opportunities for potential continuous improvements. Thus it is significant to develop a maturity model for the best fit. Even though there are several models proposed to measure maturity levels of industry 4.0, their applications to the service sector is very limited. According to the literature different authors focussed on measuring the industry 4.0 maturity of an organisation based on different dimensions. The proposed models are consisted of several maturity levels but most of them are not focussing on the characteristics addressed at each level where the organisation needed to follow with the purpose of continuous improvement. Hence it is important to consider how an organisation performs under each dimension of the maturity assessment model to understand the maturity level of industry 4.0, in order to improve the performance to the next maturity level. 0 1 2 3 4 5 Products and services Technology and Resources Strategy and organisation Operations Customers Governance Employees Maturity Assessment Series1 Series2 Actual State Desired State 1148","oshadhi bandara1, kasuni vidanagamachchi2 and ruwan wickramarachchi3 department of industrial management, faculty of science university of kelaniya sri lanka oshadhikavindra@gmail.com1, kasuniv@kln.ac.lk2 , ruwan@kln.ac.lk3","References

It is found that the algorithm is very effective to find the global optimal solution quickly. A great feature of this work is its simple calculation procedure compared to the other methods. As a whole, the proposed methodology doesn’t require careful attention to the determinations of the weight among the resources. Moreover, it incorporates the priority of the resources in the decision making process. 42 41 14 36 50 16 36 50 16 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 Cost Time Quality Units Criteria Proposed methodology New approach of Bao et al.

103,An Optimization-Based Approach Model For The  Improvement Of The Performance Of Emergency Medical,"the emergency medical services systems (ems) plays an important role in healthcare management. the alarming number of emergency cases resulting from natural and man-made disasters is experienced by any country. in the philippines, some organizations practice the ems system, however, their average response time of 15 to 30 minutes falls below the international standard of 8 minutes. this paper assesses the current performance of emergency ambulance service (eas) providers in quezon city. significant factors affecting their performance were identified using statistical tools. moreover, proposed alternative solutions were evaluated in order for eas providers attain the international standard of response time using the arcgis (geographic information system) software. the results showed that the current performance of the public and private eas providers exceeded their standard response and service times and they cannot reach 100% demand coverage using the 8-minute international standard of response. to address these inefficiencies, an optimal routing system was proposed by adding new stations so that performance measures are achieved. moreover, policies and procedures were developed to attain a standardized communication system, work schedule, and dispatch method for emergency response action. the proposed solutions improved the current performance of both public and private eas providers in quezon city.","response time, service time","In this study, the current performance of the Public and Private Emergency Ambulance Services (EAS) Providers in Quezon City were assessed. By using statistical analysis, factors for response time such as Distance of Location, Traffic Condition, Time of Day, Ambulance Speed, Dispatch Time, Day of Week, Equipment Readiness and Weather Condition, and factors for service time such as Ambulance Speed, Distance of Location, Traffic Condition, and Time of day were found to be significant factors. Using these factors as bases, the researchers proposed two alternatives to improve the current performance of the EAS providers. Alternative 1 aims to increase ambulance speed to at least 40 kph. In this way, the actual 35% demand coverage within an 8-minute response criterion will increase to 66% (or higher) demand coverage. A routing analysis was used to help improve the ambulance speed to at least 40 kph. While Alternative 2 was proposed to fully cover all the demand areas in Quezon City. In Alternative 2, a minimum of 6 additional ambulance stations is needed to achieve 100% demand coverage. However, some of the stations are placed in the flooded areas, this lead to an optimal solution which is an additional 8 ambulance stations. Also, a routing analysis was used to locate the nearest hospitals in a certain demand areas and proposed ambulance station.

104,A Rough-Set Based-Approach For Anticipating Competitor’S  Decisions,"in the evolving competitive environment, characterized by competition, rapid market change, and globalization, companies have to enhance their competitive advantage to survive. in such a context, they have to continuously monitor and process information on their competitive environment in order to have an informational advantage over their competitors (their capabilities, vulnerabilities, intentions and potential moves). getting better informational and intelligence support is critical and vital. competitive intelligence (ci) appears then as a vital component of strategic planning and management process. developing a ci process within a company leads to several benefits such as anticipating moves of the other competitors by shedding light on competitor strategies, discovering new competitors or potential customers, identifying and analyzing situations, from competitors, customers, suppliers and others factors that influence the success or the failure of the company. the competitive intelligence concept has attracted growing attention in the last two decades. existing literature shows that ci is a multi-disciplinary concept studied by researchers with different fields of expertise and from different points of view either as a concept, a product, a process, a practice/discipline, a method, or a system. despite this great diversity in the body of knowledge related to the ci, ci solutions proposed to the decision-maker are limited. the objective of this paper is to propose a practical ci solution for the anticipation of competitor’s decisions in order to support the decision-making of a company. since anticipation evolves under uncertainty, our proposed solution adapts the rough set theory, which has the ability to deal with vagueness, uncertainty, and inconsistencies. a modified rough set and lem2 algorithms were used to generate rules that help the decision maker anticipating competitor actions. the proposed solution goes further with the aggregation of the generated decision rules using a new proposed algorithm that will contribute to enhancing manager’s decision-making process. to motivate the research, the whole proposed approach is illustrated considering a case study in the field of telecommunications.",rough set theory,,"dhekra ben sassi department of information systems college of computer engineering and science, prince sattam bin abdulaziz university, al kharej, ksa riadi laboratory, national school of computer science, la manouba, tunisia bensassi.dhekra@yahoo.fr frini anissa department of management science university of quebec at rimouski, levis, canada 1595, boulevard alphonse-desjardins lévis (québec) canada g6v 0a6 anissa_frini@uqar.ca",
105,Suitability Of Industry 4.0 Concepts For Small And Medium  Sized Enterprises: Comparison Between An Expert Survey,"the introduction of industry 4.0 is currently mainly taking place in large companies. in order to introduce the concepts and technologies of industry 4.0 into small and medium-sized enterprises as well, however, there is a need for organizational tools, which show which industry 4.0 concepts are best suited to the respective size of enterprise. at present, there is no scientifically founded knowledge on this subject. therefore, based on a company survey and an expert survey, this paper examines and discusses the suitability of industry 4.0 concepts in different company sizes. the aim is to find out which industry 4.0 concepts are considered promising by users (enterprises) and experts. on this basis, a final list of suitable industry 4.0 concepts per company size will be provided.","industry 4.0, assessment model, maturity model","and outlook The introduction of Industry 4.0 in industrial companies poses a particular challenge for small and medium-sized enterprises. While large enterprises can afford their own personnel resources for the introduction and research of Industry 4.0 topics, this is usually not the case with SMEs. Therefore, the aim of this work was to identify the most promising Industry 4.0 concepts for different sizes of enterprises (small, medium, large) on the basis of an existing Industry 4.0 self-assessment tool as well as a survey conducted among enterprises and experts. The study showed that the potential of Industry 4.0 concepts is assumed to be much higher by medium-sized and large enterprises than by small enterprises. Experts in particular see a great opportunity in the introduction and transfer of Industry 4.0 in medium-sized enterprises. While large enterprises show a uniform and homogeneous picture of meanings between enterprises and experts, this is not the case for small and medium-sized enterprises. This shows that there are still major discrepancies between research and industrial practice and that there is therefore a need for further research and knowledge transfer to bring Industry 4.0 into this kind of companies. Further research is therefore needed for the future to investigate why Industry 4.0 concepts have not yet been adopted in some cases. Especially for small enterprises a more detailed investigation should be carried out in the future to understand why Industry 4.0 is considered to have a lower potential. 1183","and a user survey erwin rauch, thomas stecher, marco unterhofer, patrick dallasega and dominik t. matt industrial automation and engineering (iea) faculty of science and technology, free university of bolzano, piazza università 5, 39100 bolzano, italy erwin.rauch@unibz.it, thomas.stecher@natec.unibz.it, marco.unterhofer@unibz.it, patrick.dallasega@unibz.it, dominik.matt@unibz.it","References

107,Identification Of Health System Stakeholders In Morocco,"the objective of this paper is to identify the health system stakeholders in morocco. the methodology is based on two steps. first, a literature review was performed to establish a preliminary list of the main categories of health systems stakeholders. second, the said list was projected onto the moroccan context, seeking correspondence between each category of stakeholders and their moroccan counterparts. then we proceeded to detail each category by listing the actors it includes through the analysis of national reports by the ministry of health and others. results allow visualizing a wide range of actors with different roles and objectives. key words stakeholders, health system, mapping, morocco. 1. introduction health facilities are required, nowadays more than before, to improve their services’ quality (frichi, jawab, et boutahari 2018b). in this context, the concept of total quality management is adopted as quality improvement approach with a client-supplier orientation (mendes et dias 2018), which places the satisfaction of internal and external actors as an objective to be measured and constantly improved (frichi, jawab, et boutahari 2018a). however, health systems are characterized by the multiplicity and diversity of stakeholders (or actors) at different levels. achieving the satisfaction of all these stakeholders is a quiet difficult task (ezzerouali 2008). thus, it is necessary to rank stakeholders in order to prioritize those who are the most concerned by quality improvement issues. however, before ranking them a question of great practical relevance arises: who are the stakeholders in the health system? the ambition of this paper is to contribute to providing answers to this question by limiting the paper’s scope on the case of the moroccan health system. the theoretical framework adopted is the stakeholder theory, which is the basis of the strategic management of organizations. the paper is organized in three parts. in the first one, we briefly review the foundations and objectives of the stakeholder theory. in the second part, we establish a preliminary list of the main categories of health systems stakeholders based on international researches. the third part is devoted to identifying heath system stakeholders in morocco. 2. stakeholder theory 2.1. definition stakeholder theory provides an analysis of the company's relationships with its environment (gond et mercier 2004). it is an attempt to redesign the firm's theory, to further integrate the actors of its environment and to abolish the shareholder vision of profit maximization (mullenbach-servayre 2007). this theory, although already introduced in the 1960s, it has been significantly developed starting 1984, following freeman's publication of the book, strategic management : a stakeholder approach (mullenbach-servayre 2007). stakeholder theory is based on the concept of stakeholder; its definition doesn’t make any unanimity. in fact, there is no consensus among authors on a single, accepted and recognized definition (gond et mercier 2004). in this paper, we cite the most commonly used and widespread stakeholder’s definition: any group or individual who can affect or is affected by the achievement of the organization's objectives (freeman 1984). stakeholders are therefore individuals, 1193",,,"frichi youness1, jawab fouad2, boutahari said3 laboratory of manufacturing, energy and sustainable development sidi mohamed ben abdellah university fez, morocco (1) youness.frichi@usmba.ac.ma, (2) fouad.jawab@usmba.ac.ma, (3) boutahari@yahoo.fr","References

108,Challenges Of Total Quality Management In Higher  Education Institutions,"in today’s competitive environment higher education institutions (heis) are facing many challenges and growing pressure from various stakeholders. to cope with this pressure, heis require a supportive managerial approach that fosters the understanding of stakeholders’ needs and expectations. total quality management (tqm) is considered as one of the most comprehensive approaches to enhance performance and to meet customer needs. while this approach is being successfully adopted in the manufacturing sector, the same cannot be achieved in many service organisations. heis operate in a unique environment with multiple stakeholders and subjective nature of managing tqm compared with the manufacturing industry and encounter more challenges due to their unique nature. most of the existing studies focus on students and give less attention to staff. there is lack of research that that focus on staff views, thus more attention should be given to them due to their vital role as a mediator between the policymakers and students as well as their closeness to the encountered problems. some of these problems might result from the nature of heis environment, and some might originate from existing perceptions regarding tqm applicability in heis. this research aims to contribute toward the identification of tqm challenges in heis from the staff perspective in order to gain a better understanding of tqm challenges. the study designed to collect qualitative data by conducting semi-structured interviews with staff from heis. the findings are expected to be an important step towards the identification of major tqm challenges in heis and to create better awareness regarding the potential obstacles as well as to call future research to move towards the second step of seeking and proposing a tqm- framework that facilitate successful tqm implementation.",,,"abdullah al-amri department of design, manufacture and engineering management, university of strathclyde, glasgow, 75 montrose st, glasgow g1 1xj, uk abdullah.al-amri@strath.ac.uk t.c. wong department of design, manufacture and engineering management, university of strathclyde, glasgow, 75 montrose st, glasgow g1 1xj, uk andy.wong@strath.ac.uk",
109,Applications Of Virtual Reality (Vr) As Teaching Tool To  Enrich Students Learning,"instruction in higher education institutions continues to proceed along the traditional path. exposure to real-life experiences relevant to the discipline of study could greatly enhance students’ understanding of how their study relates to the real world. this is particularly important for engineering students where the focus is on finding practical solutions to real-life problems. offering such experiences, however, is restricted by many limiting factors. recent technological advancements in the fields of simulation and virtual/augmented reality present a viable solution to offer semi-real experiences that avoid many of the limiting factors. an important consideration for this approach is that students won’t have to physically leave campus to gain the intended experience. in this presentation, authors present the applications of the virtual reality as a teaching medium for providing students with realistic experiences in relation to manufacturing processes. this presentation is also intended to demonstrate how: • complex systems utilizing simulation tools that support virtual reality and allow the students to walk through and interact with the virtual surroundings could be developed. • students could utilize the virtual environment to further improve real systems. • students could create and experiment with their own models and to optimize their proposed systems output by 3d virtual systems.","virtual reality, manufacturing",,"mohamed y. ismail and hamid r. parsaei texas a&m university at qatar qatar foundation, education city doha, qatar mohamed.ismail@qatar.tamu.edu, hamid.parsaei@qatar.tamu.edu boback parsaei integrated technology systems, inc. houston, texas, usa bobackparsaei@outlook.com",
110,Predictive Maintenance As A Means To Improve The  Availability Of Centrifugal Slurry Pump At Ergo City Deep,"centrifugal slurry pumps are used in many applications such as in the mining, chemical and in the industrial plants. ergo city deep plant uses centrifugal slurry pumps to pump slurry from its pumping station to elsburg pumping station over a distance of about 50 km. due to unplanned breakdowns, the pumps are not operating at peak efficiency point, and as a result the plant does not meet its monthly production target. ergo city deep plant used reactive (breakdown) maintenance, which had escalated the maintenance operating costs year on year. in this study, predictive maintenance through condition monitoring techniques was used to improve the availability of centrifugal slurry pump. this research proved that predictive maintenance is a better maintenance method for centrifugal slurry pumps than reactive maintenance, because the pumps availability increased by 49 %, the downtime and maintenance costs have also been reduced simultaneously by 58%. furthermore, also production losses have been reduced, and therefore boosted the profit margin of the organization.","downtime, maintenance cost",,"plant aroon martinus, jan harm c pretorius and arie wessels post graduate school of engineering management, university of johannesburg, johannesburg, south africa aroonm@uj.ac.za, jhpretorius@uj.ac.za, ariewessels@gmail.com",
111,Sustainable Biodegradable Packaging Material:  A Solution For Decreasing Available Capacity,"plastic packaging material plays a vital role in people’s daily lives, and it is a fact that most of which are petroleum- based like the one being used in the philippines. this type of plastic is very strong, less brittle, but non-biodegradable that would take hundreds of years before it decays, which in turn decreases the available capacity of sanitary landfills. if this scenario continued, many of the sanitary landfills in the philippines will be forced to close as what the others have already been into. due to this concern, this research would introduce the use of a sustainable biodegradable packaging material which can be a substitute to the petroleum-based plastics. this research will identify various alternatives and choose among these alternatives through the application of multi-criteria decision making with consideration of valuable criteria in selecting a packaging material. the chosen alternative will then be subjected for demand and supply analysis to check the readiness of the philippines for the use of the chosen sustainable biodegradable packaging material, and check its eventual impact to the capacity of sanitary landfills.",sanitary landfill,,"of landfills in the philippines juan miguel n. dinglasan master of science in industrial engineering and management polytechnic university of the philippines manila, philippines migdinglasan@gmail.com",
112,Cognitive Ergonomics And Electrophysiological Measures Of  Human Attention And Performance,"in the design of complex systems, the accurate measure and prediction of human operator workload can be critical. if a genuine human-system interface is what is desired, the system components must have the capability to “detect” system state and adapt accordingly. eeg is perhaps the most accurate means available to directly measure changes in neural activity. until now, use of eeg has required carefully controlled conditions, extensive set-up time and in- depth knowledge for operation and interpretation. new non-conductive-gel electrodes have been created by several groups. these systems are “pull-on”, like a bathing cap. recording systems and analytic techniques have also become more advanced. further, human eye tracking technology has experienced significant improvement in recent years in such critical areas as sampling. to date, many eye activity behaviors are correlated with visual and cognitive demands of various tasks. what is lacking in the current body of literature are real time models of human operator state that can be integrated into the system functioning. with input concerning operator state available to an adaptive system, the task itself could be modified to account for operator fatigue, attentional state, and other performance characteristics of interest.","(12 font) cognition, attention, phd",,"bradley chase industrial & systems engineering shiley-marcos school of engineering university of san diego san diego, ca 92110, usa bchase@sandiego.edu",
113,Barriers Analysis Of Women’S Entrepreneurship  Development In Greater Jakarta,"entrepreneurs in developing countries encounter several problems that might undermine their ability to become effective entrepreneurs and contribute to the national economy. these problems could exacerbate in micro-businesses and more specifically in women entrepreneurship. meanwhile, women entrepreneurship is one of many sectors which potentially boost nation’s income of the country. however, there is a paucity of studies about women entrepreneurship in general and indonesia, a developing country, in particular. therefore, barriers analysis is needed to examine the problem so that it can be used as a reference in creating an enabling environment. this paper examines barriers which faced by indonesian women entrepreneur especially for greater jakarta area and having micro and small business scale using four indicators: individual-familial, socio-cultural, economic-financial-commercial and structural that we adopted from niazkar & arab-moghaddam (2011) framework. an online questionnaire was spread out and data collected from 50 women entrepreneur respondents. based on the survey, there were distinctive barriers among women entrepreneur in indonesia. orderly from the most important barriers as follows: economic-financial-commercial, structural, socio-cultural, and personal-familial.",sociocultural,"In this study we examined the barriers of women entrepreneurship in Indonesia in Greater Jakarta. Based on the result, the first variable about individual-familial has one question about various obligation in life (job-family) was not valid. It might have been because 74% respondents were single and 46% of the respondents did not have the number of a dependents. The rest of the variables are valid and reliable. From the results, it can be concluded that the most significant barriers to women entrepreneurship are in the following order: economic-financial-commercial, structural, socio-cultural, and individual-familial. Individual-familial had the highest percentage barrier which came from lack of information about supportive resources. Socio-cultural was the biggest barrier in responsibility and sensitivity necessary to entrepreneurship. In addition, economic-financial-commercial had the higesht percentage barrier in cooperation in allocating expenses, and the last variable of structural had the most barrier in identification of new markets.

115,Aggregated Metrics To Assess Fuel Consumption In Freight  Fleets,"vehicle-fleet´s managers require to identify relevant aggregate metrics to monitor the performance of their vehicles and drivers. the chosen metric should help in the decision making process of programs relative to the vehicle maintenance, drivers awarding, vehicle routing, fleet renovation, among others. it is well known that fuel consumption is around half of the operative cost of vehicular fleets. however, fuel consumption depends of several factors, such as, vehicle weight, load, route, vehicle technology, road conditions, driving patterns, traffic, among others. therefore fuel consumption by itself is not an appropriate metric for these purposes. the situation worsen for the case of freight transportation where companies usually have a large diversity of vehicles capacities and technologies and cover many different routes. we hypothesized that fuel consumption, measured as l/km-gross ton, is the metric to follow. to test this hypothesis, a monitoring campaign was developed on a non-homogenous fleet of 50 heavy-duty freight vehicles, with nationwide operation, in a country with large variations in altitude (0-3500 masl), during two months of normal operation. fuel consumption behavior was analyzed with several options of performance metrics. results indicated that for cases when vehicles are almost always fully loaded, specific consumption measured in [l/km – curb ton] also works for these purposes.","fuel consumption, assessment metrics","Unlike the original hypothesis, that FE3 would be the most independent metric to be followed, results showed that no significant differences were observed between FE2 and FE3. More importantly, results showed that FE4 is the metric that though not identically, is the most similarly normally distributed. In addition, the fact that the 𝑅𝑅𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎 2 of FE4 of the ANOVA for all the logistics variables studied are so low (below 10%) can be interpreted as this metric is the most ""dimensionless"" or more ""independent"" of the operational factors that are controllable at a logistic planning level. This suggests that it is a good option to take it as an input parameter in logistic models such as vehicle routing, resource allocation, among others. For the studied case, the fuel consumption parameter is 4.07 l/100km-et with a standard deviation of 0.65. This value should be multiplied by the curb weight of the selected vehicle and the distance to be assigned to travel in a given route to estimate fuel consumption and then its cost. The most dimensionless fuel consumption metric that is distributed normally and that applies to the entire data set is FE4 (l /100km-empty vehicle weight (tons)). 1236","jenny díaz ramírez department of engineering universidad de monterrey monterrey, n.l. 66238, mexico jenny.diaz@udem.edu josé ignacio huertas energy and climate change research group school of engineering and science tecnológico de monterrrey monterrey, n.l., 68849, mexico jhuertas@itesm.mx nicolas giraldo peralta mechanical, electromechanical, and biomedical department universidad antonio nariño bogota, d.c., colombia nicolas.giraldo@uan.edu.co","References

116,Ergonomic Design Of An Assistive Propulsion System For  Manual Wheelchairs,"disability has always been a problem in developing countries like the philippines. it is even aggravated by the environment and the lack of tools or equipment that can assist the handicapped people. although there are equipment or assistive tools that designed specifically for use by these individuals, they contribute only a very small percentage of the total number of products that the handicapped people need. survey was conducted to explore the current issues facing wheelchair users and to address the problems they experience in wheelchair usage. results showed that users experience difficulty in propelling, steering, and transferring to and from the wheelchairs that result to discomfort and musculoskeletal disorders of the users. thus, this research paper is focused on developing an ergonomic design of hand-cycle attachment that assists heavy-loaded wheelchair users especially when wheeling through long distances, challenging terrains and slopes. features of the proposed design consist of synchronous propulsion system, foldability, mobility, adjustability, easy installation and stability by adding a stand that would keep the hand-cycle attachment in its upright position even when it is not in use. clamping system and lever are also added to apply tensile and compressive forces to the wheelchair and can be rotated to maintain an ideal seat inclination of users in using wheelchairs. in addition to these, the design also includes a free-wheeling mechanism so the users will not have to apply force to the pedals all the time to keep the device running. the usability and effectiveness of the proposed hand- cycle attachment device was tested and validated using rapid upper limb assessment (rula) tool. it was found that the use of the proposed device significantly decreased the risk of users for musculoskeletal disorders and provide ease and comfort for users compared to wheelchair use alone. through the application of the principle of mechanics, propulsive force with the attachment device was computed to be significantly lower than the current tangential force applied by wheelchair users on the hand rims during propulsion. respondents who tested the prototype also reported significantly lower propulsion difficulty scores.","wheelchair users, anthropometry","A vast majority of wheelchair users are faced daily with many struggles, attributable mostly to inaccessibility and the lack of the mobility required to participate fully in a normal Filipino life. Postures taken on by wheelchair users during propulsion pose a risk of developing musculoskeletal disorders as revealed by RULA. Additionally, wheelchair users perceive propulsion to be very difficult, resulting to pains in the back, arms, and hands. In response to these problems, this study revolved around creating a design of an ergonomic, detachable, foldable, and cost-effective hand-cycle attachment. The prototype key specifications include a folded dimension of 2.17 x 1.17 x 3.67 cubic feet, a 15-second installation time, a gain ratio between the wheel and the hand cranks of about 3.48, a weight of 17.6 pounds, an adjustable hand- crank height and distance, and a material cost of PhP 4,527.44. Features differentiating the proposed design in this study from the existing mobility aids are the synchronous propulsion system, foldability, capability of being stowed inside vehicles, adjustability, easy installation, and stability by adding a stand that would keep the hand-cycle attachment in its upright position. A clamping system and a lever apply both tensile and compressive forces to the wheelchair, rotating it slightly by 10°, which was known to be the ideal seat inclination. These two product characteristics also facilitate the lifting of the caster wheels and the stand off the ground to prevent these from hitting slight bumps in the road during travel. Aside from these, the prototype also features a free-wheeling mechanism, so the user will not have to apply force to the pedals all of the time to keep the device running. Quality Function Deployment gave way to the formulation of the initial design specifications that were given priority in the design. This tool also enabled the translation of the wheelchair users’ needs and requirements into their technical equivalents. Through Value Engineering, it was decided upon which among the alternatives should be adopted for the propulsion system, folding system, attachment method, and the type of material that would yield the highest values as perceived by the customers. Working in conjunction with Anthropometric Analysis, the Theory of Inventive Problem Solving was used to address trade-offs identified in the roof of the House of Quality, thus resulting to the formulation of the design’s adjustment mechanism. Design Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (DFMEA) was carried out to pro- actively prevent or mitigate the risks involved with the use of the product through some design modifications, maintenance procedures, and safety measures. The outcome was a working prototype that integrates all the technical requirements. Issues experienced during the course of the prototype fabrication were the wheel diameter, corrosion rate of the material, and the hand crank distance range. The latter two, however, were resolved by coating the metal frame with paint and by placing a cushion at the backrest to retain the leaning position of the user during propulsion, respectively. The wheel diameter, although exceeding the specification, did not cause the weight of the entire attachment to go beyond the upper limit and in fact, also improved the mechanical advantage of the hand-cycle by increasing the distance travelled for every rotation of the hand crank. Still, most of the initial design specifications were adequately met. Apart from the biomechanical analysis of the hand-cycle which showed that the required propulsive force indeed decreased, the prototype testing further built up on this finding by showing that users now perceive propulsion as an easy activity, compared to how they previously rated wheelchair propulsion as very difficult. The hand-cycle attachment was deployable in less than a minute, and users found it easy to install the device without needing assistance from other people. However, they experienced slight difficulties in steering the hand-cycle due to the weight being supported by the hand-cycle, and they also find it hard to squeeze the hand brake. RULA score decreased from 6 to 3, 1246","madylaine g. delfin and danna may g. mendez school of industrial engineering and engineering management mapua university intramuros, manila mgdelfin@mapua.edu.ph, dgmendez@mapua.edu.ph","References

117,A Study On The Facility Layout And Design Of Sugar Plants In The  Philippines,"a well-managed warehouse system with effective facility layout design is the key concept of modern supply chain system and has an important role in the success of a company (baker and canessa, 2009). according to glock & grosse (2012) several components must be considered when developing an efficient warehouse facility layout and design, one of which is the material placement and location, and one of the critical activities in material placement is order picking. picking process have become an important part of the supply chain process and is seen as the most labor-intensive and costly activity for almost every warehouse, where the cost is estimated to be 55% of the total warehouse operating expense. that is why, the researchers aim to design facility layout focusing on material placement and location for warehouse system. the study covers two largest sugar milling warehouses in the philippines that experience delay in material placement due to slow response time and long cycle time in its picking process. techniques such as time study, abc inventory analysis, quality function deployment (qfd) tool, systematic layout planning (slp) and systems simulation were used in order to design and improve the current material placement layout of the companies. it is concluded that using abc inventory analysis based on the order picking frequency of materials and implementation of “u” flow material warehouse layout design significantly reduces time and distance spent in searching and picking activities and improves the overall warehouse operation of the companies.",material placement,"Material placement and warehouse facility layout design is the main core of this research study. The material warehouses of Batangas Sugar Central Incorporated (BSCI) and Central Azucarera de Don Pedro Incorporated (CADPI) have been considered in this research since the two largest sugar milling companies in the country experience delay due to slow response time and long cycle time in order picking activity. Techniques such as motion and time study, ABC inventory analysis, quality function deployment (QFD), systematic layout planning and system simulation were developed and used to design and improve the facility layout for material placement and location. The researchers applied the ABC classification based on the picking frequency of the materials in the warehouse. Class A materials that have the highest picking frequency are therefore located in areas with the easiest, best access, and are stored closest to the input and output doors of the proposed layout. Class B materials that have a medium picking frequency are located in areas less desirable compared to class A material. And for class C materials that have the lowest picking frequency are located in the least desirable location in the material warehouse. The researchers concluded that using ABC inventory analysis significantly reduced the cycle time and distance travelled in searching and picking activities. Using the quality function deployment, systematic layout planning and systems simulation showed that “U” flow material layout design is the best layout design alternative. The results showed that material warehouse performance based on minimized total travel distance and time can be improved for class A, B, C, AB, AC, BC and ABC materials using the “U” flow material layout design. Simulation results indicated that the combined techniques offer significant improvement to the existing layout design. The average reduction in cycle time for both companies resulted in 40.8% decrease and resulted in 5.5% decrease in average travel distance. Finally, using Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA) and Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) showed a significant improvement in the facility design by applying the “U” flow material layout. The estimated benefit for the proposed “U” flow based on cost benefit analysis amounts to PhP 622,711,852.10. The estimated benefits are greater than the estimated cost thus the proposed action is potentially advisable and should be further evaluated as a realistic opportunity. For FMEA, “U” flow material warehouse layout design shows that only congestion is the possible risk that may be encountered if the layout design is implemented while potential risks for “Through” flow material warehouse layout design are congestion, longer travel distance and security risk. Therefore, the researchers recommend the “U” flow material warehouse layout design for BSCI and CAPDI companies. The layout design has two separate doors for incoming and outgoing materials, one designated receiving area, one designated shipping area, one designated receiving staging area, one designated shipping staging area, storage area, equipment area and office. Materials flow in at receiving area, move in to the storage area and then to the shipping area in a “U” line flow. The proposed layout design significantly reduced the cycle time and travel distance for order picking activity.","madonna f. andrada and muriem r. biscocho school of industrial engineering and engineering management mapua university intramuros, manila city andrada_madonna@yahoo.com, muriembiscocho@gmail.com",

119,The Impact Of Just In Time (Jit) In Inventory Management  – Perspectives From Two Case Studies In A South African,"with the increasing pressure and competition from global forces on trade industries, supply chains, transportation and shipment, many countries have adopted the use of just-in-time (jit) inventory systems. over the years, many organizations have tried to use jit to manage their inventory management systems and reduce costs related to inventory. this makes the technique the mostly tried system in inventory management. this research paper is based on assessing organizations within south africa and the application of just in time technique as a tool to manage inventory. by using this tool, cost can be reduced, and this is one of the advantages of using jit. jit is a japanese philosophy, so it was established and developed in japanese culture. organizations that are not japanese are therefore inclined to modify certain aspects of jit to fully and seamlessly integrate it into their manufacturing process. this study will assess how south africa have adopted the philosophy and modified it to fit in cultures in both manufacturing and service industries. the research design that will be used is explanatory research. a correlational study will be done. the setting in which this study will be done is the normal setting of production, using analysis tools the impact of jit will be assesses based on results and make recommendations.",just in time,"and the Way Forward Figure 2.

120,The Impact Of Corporate Social Responsibility On Consumer  Purchase Behaviour In High-Street Uk Retailers,,,"In conclusion, this research shows that the CSR does influence consumer’s purchase behaviour, even though it doesn’t influence all people. According to these participants, there are many things to be considered other than CSR. Purchasing products from company with good CSR also make the consumers feel relieved and satisfied. This feeling also makes these consumers want to repurchase the brand. Although there is only 1 person’s buying behaviour that is directly influenced by CSR, but all of the participants agreed that buying from company that has good CSR make them feel relieved and safe. In other words, CSR can build brand trust, indirectly. A brand should think about their CSR activities, as well as the quality and design. When all of the factors are fulfilled, the brand will be successful and will be able to influence the customer to be more aware ethically. 7. Recommendation This research was done by interviewing the general customers without asking about their age, occupations, status. For a deeper research, further research can be done to analyze deeper about the demographics factor that influence CSR Awareness (such as age, gender, jobs, ethnicity etc.) Maturity level in every age is different and CSR awareness in people from developing and developed country also different.",,
121,"An Energy Harvesting Alternative To Wellhead Gas Chokes  Albertus Retnanto, Ph.D.","current practices utilize chokes in the wellhead to induce a pressure drop in high production gas wells to produce at a constant rate. consequently, in this setup, the potential for this pressure to be made useful is lost. in contrast, the use of a turbo-expander could induce this same necessary pressure drop while simultaneously utilizing it to generate energy. to estimate the potential benefits of this modified system, some assessments were made. all tests conducted in this investigation utilized the thermodynamic property tables of pure methane to model the performance of produced reservoir gases. the first test conducted attempted to model the amount of mechanical energy lost across a typical choke at varying pressure ratios and flow rates. the second test modelled the theoretical energy that could be harvested across a turbo-expander. using the relationships deduced between pressure ratio and power generated across a turbo-expander an equation relating the two parameters was derived. this equation was then applied to a case study representing a high producing gas well in the middle east region to appraise the effectiveness of turbo- expander use on wells of this caliber. reservoir parameters were estimated based upon parameters typically found in the region and were then used to create a production forecast for one well. the results of this case study indicate that expansion use in gas wells with production rates of roughly 100 mmscfd/well show an average power generation of 2.2 mw/d/well in a five-year span towards the middle of the plateau production region. over an entire production plateau and at some different wells, the power generation benefits of turbo-expander use could greatly improve the energy efficiency of gas production wells.","gas wells, wellhead choke, turbo-expander, power generation","Based on the models tested, the mechanical energy lost across a choke is less than the energy that can be harvested in a turbo-expander. This is a result of the fact that the choke model only accounts for the transport energy lost and does not quantify the energy that is transformed into internal energy. An increase in pressure ratio and flow rate will increase energy loss and consequently the amount of energy that can be harvested through expansion. Turbo-expander outlets are subject to an increased temperature drop than usual due to the enhance Joule Thompson effect. In the industry this can lead to complications such as hydrate formation and condensate drop out. In order to avoid this the fluid needs to be pre or post heated. In high producing gas wells such as those in the Middle East, in a five year span at a constant plateau rate of roughly 100 MMSCF/D/well the average power generated is 2.19 MW/D/well.","petroleum engineering texas a&m university at qatar doha, qatar albertus.retnanto@qatar.tamu.edu mohamed idris petroleum engineering texas a&m university at qatar doha, qatar idris.mohamed47@gmail.com",
122,The Dynamics Of Community And Parents Participation:   Huyula Culture Approach In Educational Financing In High,": this research aims to determine community participation in financing education in gorontalo province by using a mixing approach method combining quantitative and qualitative methods known as combination research called concurrent embedded. the results of this research about the dynamics of community participation in financing education compared to public participation has been experiencing declining. the decline occurs in gorontalo, in line with the incessant campaign against extortion and free education programs in various local governments. society and parents view that financing has been fulfilled through the state budget (apbn) budget, namely in the form of school operational assistance (bos), with education policies for the people (prodira) carried out by the gorontalo provincial government, as well as the regency and city governments of gorontalo province . currently education funding from the bos budget, and prodira has been fulfilling the policy of education equity, but not being able to improve the quality of education as the expectations of education stakeholders. for that reason, a good solution for improving the quality of education, the support and participation of the community and parents of students in financing education is still needed, especially from the upper middle class who has higher income.",education funding,"The amount of education costs provided by the central government through the School Operational Assistance (BOS) and the Gorontalo Provincial Government through the People's Education Program (PRODIRA) provides benefits to education equity to the levels of high school, vocational and MA education to remote areas, but on the other hand creates a new phenomenon in the form of a decrease in the participation of the community and parents of students in financing education. Ideally education is the responsibility of the government, the community and parents of students. To boost the participation of the community and parents of the students, the Gorontalo local culture approach, namely huyula culture, mutual assistance, mutual assistance and transparency in financial management. The support of education costs from the community and parents will accelerate the superior vision and program of the Gorontalo provincial government, namely quality education will be more quickly realized.

Independent demand rates of items with shortage considering no volume discount. The aim was to determine optimal order quantity such that objective function is minimized and constraints hold. The developed nonlinear programming model was solved by Pareto based multi- objective particle swarm optimization algorithm. Taguchi L9 design was applied to calibrate the parameters of the algorithm and the combination that best suited to the objective was chosen. Some recommendations for future work are to develop a probabilistic model using fuzzy and stochastic demand, to consider volume discount, lead time uncertainty, defective items, inflation and time value of money and other performance metrics and to apply recently developed meta-heuristic nature inspired algorithms to solve the problem.","ferdous sarwar, mahjabin rahman and mushaer ahmed department of industrial & production engineering bangladesh university of engineering & technology dhaka, bangladesh ferdoussarwar@ipe.buet.ac.bd, mahjabin.buet@gmail.com, mushaerahmed@gmail.com",

125,Development Of Educational Process Capability Maturity  Model,"abstract- this study aims to development of educational process capability maturity model, which can be applied in the higher education sector for quality and process improvement in educational services. a new model is established by adopting a philosophy and concepts of the quality management maturity model for crosby and maturity model cmm-based software, as well as, using the critical successful factors in higher education. currently, a majority of higher educational organizations need to develop an approach or model for measuring their educational process capability maturity due to the global challenges that affected this sector. in addition to the strong competitive environment that required to keep going with this continues improvement and achieve a higher level of performance. such as these challenges have been imposed on the higher education organizations to evaluate their performance and level of the quality service in order to obtain a high maturity level. previous studies indicated there is a lack of maturity model in the education sector because most of currently maturity models have designed for industrial sector or electronic learning processes. for this reason, this study has suggested developing a maturity model which can be exact in the higher education sector and improve their quality process. this study will discuss implementation of the maturity model in the higher education organizations.",,"In this study, the model presented and developed for the Maturity of the Capability of the educational process can be tested in the higher education organizations as a self-assessment tool to identify the areas of strength and weakness in its operations, which were distributed on five levels including critical success factors in higher education to determine the actual location of the educational organization within. The five maturities levels and begin to prioritize improvement to move to a level of maturity above the current level. The educational organization whose level of maturity is in the second level will improve to move to the third level of maturity, which falls within the third level, will want to move and improve to a higher level, the fourth. If it is in the fourth level, you want to move to the highest level of maturity, which is the fifth. As the educational organization decides to make improvements, the results of applying the model will serve as the cornerstone for improving the performance of its operations as follows: -Preparation for the evaluation process: requires the organization to understand the mechanism of application of the model and levels, as well as the focus areas for each of the five levels. -Selection and formation of a resident team supported by senior management, training them to understand the model levels, and on how to use the model as an assessment tool. -Prepare the necessary inputs for evaluation and determine the time period for completion of the evaluation process. - Implementation of the evaluation process by the Maturity Model of the educational process. -Analyze the results of the evaluation by the resident team and prepare a list of results. - The evaluation team shall prepare a report showing the organization's current location within (the five maturity levels) and the main areas at each level that it has not met, with a diagnosis of strengths and weaknesses. -Develop an improvement plan, to improve the current level and move to a later maturity level.

129,"Design Intervention In Maheshwar Handloom, Mp, India  Pratik Mukesh","textile industry plays important role in our country's economy. handloom weaving sector is one of the most important sectors, have the potential to produce employment. however, this sector is ignored in terms of development. due to lack of development in this field, the workers were forced to use traditional methods and equipment for their task, which was time consuming and hard work. workers suffered a lot of health problems due to the practice of traditional techniques of weaving. this leads to loss of interest by workers in this field and their migration to other areas of work. it also seriously affects the socio-economic conditions of rural people. besides, directly or indirectly it does affect the economy. it is also very time-consuming task. so, an ergonomic and technical improvement was important for upgrading traditional weaving. this work identified the issues with traditional weaving process of maheshwar handloom sector and propose solution provide a better working condition to the workers involved in the maheshwar handloom weaving sector. further, the work also focuses to provide a viable and feasible solution to reduce ergonomic risk factors and satisfy workers of maheshwar handloom weaving sector by earn profit and also increase productivity and provide efficient work.","design, ergonomics, textile, handloom","This study showed that Maheshwar Handcraft sector needed lots of ergonomics intervention. Many people were still working in bad condition which caused them health, safety, and financial issues. Initial testing was qualitative, importantly the proposed working solution was able to satisfy simulate subject’s more than previous working process in discomfort and pain response categories. It could be used in actual working conditions. Design solution was portable, low cost and even easy to build with locally available materials, those factors made them more acceptable by the Maheshwar weavers. More work can be done in this direction for the device as it cause less trouble during the whole process. Still modifications were required.","master of design, design discipline pdpm indian institute of information technology, design and manufacturing, jabalpur, m.p., india 1610421@iiitdmj.ac.in , pratikmukesh.mukesh@gmail.com",
130,Early Detection Of Equipment Failure Using One-Class  Support Vector Machine,"equipment failure is a typical problem, and it is difficult to detect it in the current technology-based industry. there are many different approaches to diagnostic reasoning such as rule-based reasoning, model-based reasoning, and qualitative model-based reasoning in preventive maintenance. in this paper, we developed a model-based approach namely one-class support vector machines (svm) to detect the faults in the oil industry. real data like pressure and temperature readings were collected from sensors which are placed at different parts of machines at each minute. also, failure occurrence of each machine is recorded. before applying the model, as an initial step, the data (‘n’ hours just before the occurrence of a failure) is fine-tuned using exponentially weighted moving average (ewma) method to remove the external noise factors which occurred while taking the readings. after fine-tuning the data, features like mean, median and peak values were extracted at the time interval of fifteen minutes. these features were also extracted using the correlation between sensor values and the information from the people who have domain knowledge on these machines. after this, we developed one-class svm model on the data. we also built multiple one-class svm models by ‘k’ fold cross validation which reduces overfitting. during this process, if the model indicates an outlier, it indicates that there is a chance of failure occurrence.","equipment failure, fault diagnosis, one-class svm, oil industry",,"k subash nirmal, prince agarwal, k nageswara reddy department of industrial and systems engineering indian institute of technology, kharagpur. west bengal, india-721302 subashnirmal1603@gmail.com, princeagarwal12@iitkgp.ac.in, knreddy@iitkgp.ac.in",

132,"Higher Initial Costs For Renewables Electricity: Emission,  Water And Job-Creation Benefits Offset The Higher Costs","the environmental consequences and depleting trends of fossil fuel reserves has made an earnest requirement of wider dissemination of renewable energy resources for power generation. energy costs from renewables are generally higher due to their high initial capital investments. wind and solar are the two major renewable energy resources accounted for 65% of the global total electricity generated from renewables (excluding hydro). despite these two renewable energy resources are relatively evenly distributed over the world and have capabilities to counteract environmental challenges, their commercial deployment is limited due to the lack of inclusion of their indirect benefits. this study examines three major indirect benefits from the solar and wind based electricity, i.e. emissions, water saving and job creation benefits and figures out how these benefits offset their higher cost per unit of electricity. we have found that solar and wind electricity create these benefits in the range of 930–950 gco2e/kwh, 0.80–3.12 l/kwh, and 0.10–1.21 person-years/gwh in compare to most common fossil fuel (coal). while valuing these benefits, an emission saving of 925 gco2e/kwh, for example, could offset 2.6 us¢/kwh of electricity price for an emission pricing of 40 us$/tonne. water and job creation benefits also offset further costs.","water saving, emission, job creation, solar",,"md. mizanur rahman, hasan mohd faizal, aminuddin saat and mazlan abdul wahid department of thermo fluids school of mechanical engineering universiti teknologi malaysia 81310 utm, johor bahru, malaysia mizanur@mail.fkm.utm.my, mfaizal@mail.fkm.utm.my amins@mail.fkm.utm.my, mazlan@mail.fkm.utm.my",

Applying stochastic optimal control theory, we have developed the optimality conditions described by Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations; that we solved numerically with Kushner's approach. The results showed that optimal policies depend on system degradation in a closed loop supply chain context. The model presented in this paper could be extended to the case of more complex systems (subject to random perturbations described by general distributions) using simulation and experimental design.","deteriorations annie francie kouedeu, jean-pierre kenné, victor songmene department of mechanical engineering, laboratory of integrated production technologies, university of qurbec, ecole de technologie supérieure, 1100 notre-dame street west, montreal, quebec, canada h3c 1k3 annie.kouedeu.1@ens.etsmtl.ca, jean-pierre.kenne@etsmtl.ca, victor.songmene@etsmtl.ca",

138,Project Risk Management In Iranian Software Projects  Ali Reza Afshari,"many software development organizations suffer chronic problems of cost overruns, schedule slips and projects that do not meet the originally specified functions in almost all software projects. this study commenced by reviewing existing risk management models. thereafter, a survey which involved software project managers in iran was conducted to gather empirical data about the practice of risk assessment. thirty software project managers participated and were interviewed. structured questionnaires were used to capture information. observation made from this study show that in iran, risk assessment is poorly practiced and many projects do not yet practice systematic risk assessment. this is because 83% of software project managers implicitly assess risks and the same percentage (83%) use unstructured approaches, poor risk identification and analysis techniques. it additionally shows that risks are not documented and experiences not properly utilized. this has led to ever recurring problems. the conclusion drawn indicates that iran’s software project managers need to start assessing risks using proper approaches. review of existing models showed that these models are complex and may not help address existing shortcomings. this study proposes a risk assessment framework, which helps managers to simply start assessing, documenting major risks, estimating risks using an objective approach that is based on frequently occurring risks to project likelihood of a risk occurring and subjective approach where objective approach is not applicable. it also supports qualitative risk estimation technique using prearranged risk estimation matrices and is supported by a tool which collects and stores risk data for analysis and improvement purposes.","project management, software projects, risk assessment","Most projects lacked formal risk assessment approaches and this is the major issue in software projects in Iran. This study reveals that, risk assessment in software projects is poorly practiced. This is because 83% of software project managers implicitly assess risks. At the same time, 83% use poor risk assessment approaches, which is either unstructured. This is mainly due to lack of awareness of formal risk assessment practices and ignorance. Even though some software project managers are aware of risk assessment good practices, they do not want to implement them because their attitude to risk assessment is very poor. They believe the process consumes much project’s valuable time. It was also noted that Software development organizations that are ISO certified assess risks in projects. This is because ISO frameworks demands for policies and development of organizations’ culture that support risk assessment and management. This study mentions two issues that were perceived to be major factors contributing to lack of formal risk assessment approaches in Iran but does not discuss them because they are not main objectives of this study. These include poor attitude on software projects risk assessment and organizations’ policies and culture which do not support the risk assessment activity. Coupled with implicit and unstructured risk assessment approaches, is lack of risk prioritisation, effective use of lessons learned and proper allocation of resources for mitigation, late or lack user participation due to poor risk assessment strategy used. The term late is used to mean that the project has reached an advanced stage where reversal of certain functions may impact the project, greatly. These explain why there is a chronic problem of schedule and budget overrun in software projects.

The SSRdM shows better performance at small 0.05 ≤ λ ≤ 0.2 for all p. When consider at small λ = 0.05, The SSRdM can detect in moderate shift (δ = 1) and some large shifts (δ = 1.5) and underperform when λ increases, λ = 0.1 can detect in large shifts (δ ≥ 1.5), at λ = 0.2 can detect in some large shifts (δ = 2.5) and at 0.3 ≤ λ ≤ 0.8 can detect underperform SSRM. The SSRdM will underperform when λ increases. It indicates that the SSRdM interest in the resolution of data with both historical and current. The SSRM shows better performance than others for all p.

In the industrial world, the data are not a normal distribution and Baxley (1990) reported, the results for a simulated industrial process requiring a larger λ (λ =0.35). The results of this study show that the SSRM is superior for detecting small, moderate and large shifts with λ ≥ 0.3 at all of p. And the SSRM is superior for detecting small shifts (δ ≤ 0.5) for all λ and p, thus the SSRM is the more modern appropriate alternative for process mean monitoring in industrial.

141,Multi-Objective Robust Optimization For The Design Of  Biomass Co-Firing Networks,"biomass co-firing in coal power plants is an immediate and practical approach to reduce coal usage and pollutant emissions because only minor modifications are required. with direct co-firing, biomass can be used directly as secondary fuel in power plants to partially displace coal. although it requires minimal investments, it can lead to equipment corrosion from unconventional fuel properties of the biomass-coal blend. with indirect co-firing, the risk of damage is minimized by separately processing biomass. the solid biochar by-product can be used as soil fertilizer to achieve further reductions in ghg emissions through carbon sequestration. however, as this calls for a separate biomass energy conversion plant, its investment cost is higher. moreover, this system faces uncertainties from the inherent variability in biomass quality. this must be accounted for because mixing fuels results in the blending of their properties. in this work, a robust optimization model is proposed to design cost and environmentally effective biomass co-firing networks that decides on appropriate co-firing configurations and fuel blends. a case study is solved to demonstrate validity. results of monte carlo simulation show that the robust optimal network configuration is relatively immune to uncertainty realizations as compared with the optimum identified with deterministic models.",,,"jayne lois g. san juan, charlle l. sy industrial engineering department de la salle university, manila, philippines jayne_sanjuan@dlsu.edu.ph, charlle.sy@dlsu.edu.ph","References

142,Factors Investigation For The Development Of Medical Device  Towards Sustainable Product,"today healthcare service has offered the modern treatment approach with medical technology. this kind of technology has become such a predominant part of healthcare service because no practical diagnosis or treatment strategy is possible without using them. the advancement of technology is also driving medical companies with great opportunities to take a new innovative product into market. in addition, company could not focus solely on large amount of volume and low production cost to keep up growth, however, they have to control its direction towards quality trusted for usage. meanwhile, climate change and pollution is increasingly unprecedented before and putting burdensome on this sector, which is lacking behind other sectors, to become sustainable manufacturing organization. that is true that medical device industry considers safety, usability and efficacy of product, but product design and development is a major role behind these factors. sustainable design, sometimes called green design, has become a globally significance topic but not many works of academic papers are directly targeted to the medical device product. therefore, the purpose of this study is initially conducted to identify influencing factors and then determine key improvement recommendation for sustainable development of medical device. analytic hierarchy process (ahp) is used to prioritize the influencing factors and quality function deployment (qfd) is used to find the key improvement attributes recommendation. the result of this study shows linear relationship between product user and developer towards quality and sustainability of product. it is found that the most of the top concerns of device users are not only safe for present use but also recyclability, which product can be made for environmental conservation, at the end of its life.","medical device, sustainability, ahp",,"taisy mak department of industrial engineering mahidol university salaya, nakhon pathom, 73170, thailand taisymak@yahoo.com, duangpun kritchanchai department of industrial engineering mahidol university salaya, nakhon pathom, 73170, thailand duangpun.skr@mahidol.ac.th",
143,Autocorrelated Multivariate Control Chart In Cooking Oil  Industry,"in this article will be discussed about the implementation of control chart in cooking oil industry. cooking oil has some parameters of quality i.e. free fatty acid (ffa), peroxide value (pv), iodine value (iv), color (red and yellow), moisture content, cloud point (cp), cloud stability (cs) and freezing point. the observed data of cooking oil quality parameters shows that the data is autocorrelated. therefore, residual mapping based on forecasting results from the time series model is used to construct autocorrelated multivariate control chart. in the multivariate t2 hotelling control chart of the residual var model (2) for chemical factor has a upper control limit (ucl) value of 22.18 and a median of 3.60. the t2 hotelling control chart of the residual var model (2) for physical factors has a control upper control limit (ucl) of 21.59 and a median value of 3.63.",quality control,"and Suggestions Some of the quality parameters used in this study are FFA, IV, PV, color red, yellow color, CP. From the results of research conducted, it is known that the quality parameters of cooking oil are correlated and autocorrelated each other. Therefore, the appropriate control chart to be used is the T2 Hotelling multivariate control chart of the residual time series model. Factor analysis is conducted to form quality parameters into two factors, namely physical factors and chemical factor. Physical factors consist of parameter FFA, color red, color yellowr. Chemical factor consist of parameter IV, PV, and CP. From the formation of time series model for physical factors and chemical factors it is known that the model corresponding to each factor is VAR (2) model.

144,A Scheduling Model For Full Maintenance Of Automated  Teller Machines,"strategies of financial institutions on cash replenishment and maintenance for a network of automated teller machines should be treated as a whole instead of independent of one another. cash replenishment is a type of maintenance and having separate service providers conduct this type of maintenance adds costs and liabilities to the financial institutions. the optimal strategy to be employed focuses on the reduction of cash-related expenses, while maintaining the appropriate banknote-levels in each atm; minimizing cash-dry instances on individual teller machines. with the increasing concern of financial institutions for customer satisfaction, the optimal strategy will also consider the amount of maintenance to be conducted for each atm; minimizing downtime on individual teller machines. factors such as daily service capacity, replenishment need, maintenance need, available time, travel time and service time are to be considered. the proposed model is able to solve situations where multiple machines are expected to breakdown on a certain day, as well as single replenishments spread throughout different days. furthermore, the dynamic element of the scheduling problem enables the model to consider changes after new forecasts or behavior for replenishment or maintenance have been made for different teller machines, after the service schedule that had been initially made.","full maintenance, replenishment","A scheduling model for the full maintenance of automated teller machines considering a proactive approach was developed and proposed in this study. The model proposed considered assumptions for constraints regarding the operating hours of armored vehicles, proactive service, service warranty, and replenishment. The model considers full maintenance, which considers both service maintenance and ATM replenishment as it is essential for financial institutions to conduct their automated teller machine operations with regard to both of these aspects. This study conducted a case study approach validation process that considered a number of ATMs being serviced by one armored vehicle through a fixed time period of one week. Considering different constraints, the model was able to determine a full maintenance schedule that indicates which ATMs to be serviced on different days. Moving forward, factors such as the number of armored vehicles able to service the network of ATMs should be considered. Second, different routes from one ATM location to another ATM location will play a factor in the scheduling model. Considering traffic will affect the travel times of the armored vehicles, and therefore, will affect the amount of time left to service each machine. Furthermore, appropriate distribution functions should also be used for the determination of ATM service time, as well as decrease of ATM cash levels. The following recommendations will be able to predict a more accurate behavior of the teller machines, and therefore, may also lead to a more accurate scheduling model for the full maintenance of automated teller machines.","carlos ilagan, angelia trinidad, john lorenz wee, charlle sy industrial engineering department de la salle university, manila, philippines carlos_ilagan@dlsu.edu.ph, angelia_trinidad@dlsu.edu.ph, john_lorenz_wee@dlsu.edu.ph, charlle.sy@dlsu.edu.ph",

150,Identifying Drivers Of Lean Six Sigma Implementation In The  Process Industries: A Case Study,"process industry is rapidly growing in bangladesh. lean six sigma (lss), a process improvement tool, can be applied to this sector for efficient operational performance. since there have been manifold factors which influence and induce the process performance while implementing lss, prevailing drivers have been sorted out from the survey on the managers of analogous companies. in the proposed framework, interpretive structural modeling (ism) has been applied to check the contextual relationship among the selected drivers and micmac analysis has been implemented to categorize the drivers according to their influence on company’s performance based on the driving power and dependence on each other. the proposed model integrates ism and micmac analysis to sort the drivers from least to greatest influence it has on process performance. the focus of this paper is to aid the practitioners in prioritizing the drivers while implementing lss in the process industry.","lean six sigma, drivers, impeding factors, limitations","Interpretive Structural Modelling (ISM) helps us to develop a systematic and directional structure for a complex system along with a practical picture of the system. It indicates the direct and indirect association among the critical drivers of implementing LSS in process industries. It also provides different levels of the potent drivers. With the help of these levels of the drivers, a structural framework is developed. With the help of these framework and knowledge of different levels of different drivers, a decision maker can easily co-ordinate among these drivers which will accelerate the process of implementing LSS in process industries. MICMAC analysis provides four different cluster through drive power and dependence power. From this ISM method and MICMAC analysis we find the critical drivers and co-relation among them which will accelerate the process of implementing LSS in process industries.

151,Developing Green Supply Chains For New Kuwait: A  Strategic Approach,"green supply chain management (gscm) refers to the concept of integrating and incorporating green concepts and eco-friendly thinking to traditional supply chain management initiatives (gsci) which include processes such as products design, materials sourcing and selection, manufacturing and production management. this research work is an approach at strategic level to evolve green supply chains practice for new kuwait, the state of kuwait’s national development plan towards a prosperous and sustainable future. grounded on the institutional theory and the natural resource based view (nrbv), a framework is developed to act as a decision making tool for top management in prioritizing and implementing selected green strategies. this study investigates how company xyz for metals and recycling, iso 14001 certified, prioritizes its green strategies and where its gscis are implemented. for different green strategies, the outcomes of the analytical network process (anp), analytical hierarchy process (ahp), and structural equation modelling (sem) clearly showed company xyz the different prioritizations and which to enforce such as; pollution prevention, product stewardship and clean technology through green initiatives. using our developed decision-making framework, product stewardship was the most significant strategy to adopt for company xyz in order to become green, gain a competitive advantage, and achieve cost reduction it thrives for.",,"and research implications To conclude, after reviewing the two main theories, which are the Natural Resource Based View theory, and the institutional theory, that represent the external and internal drivers affecting the implementation of GS in the supply chain, we were able to build our conceptual model and designing our decision-making tool. By identify the conceptual model for developing the green supply chain, which analyzes the importance and the performance of GSC initiatives. As the word importance refer to the significance of the green practices depending on the company’s priorities for accepting and adopting green strategies. And the word performance measures the current level of the company’s environmental improvement. The thought is devoted to make a relationship between empirical study and the approach of measurable decision-making tool by using statistical tools such as Analytic Network Process (ANP), Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), and Structural Equation Modelling (SEM). To improve and develop the strategic changes that needed to be considered by manufacturing companies to become green during this project. Through an approach to develop green supply chain to the New Kuwait in order to achieve the goal of the Kuwait National Development Plan of creating an environmental awareness in society that contributes to the pillar of living environmental. New Kuwait plan aims to transform Kuwait to be cultural and economic hub. As the outcome in Figure (9) this study found that prioritization of green strategies for XYZ Company should focus on product stewardship with the weight of 48% and then pollution prevention with the weight of 27%. These strategies should be implemented in their supply chain starting with 35% greening post use then 27% for the greening upstream to gain their competitive advantage in term of cost reduction.

152,A Case Study Of 5S Implementation In Inspection Process   Karthik Subburaman,"5s is lean tool which involves workplace organization and is implemented to reduce the searching time of a product. the methodology adopted in this paper is the 5s pillar approach: seiri, seiton, seiso, seiketsu, shitsuke to increase the overall efficiency of the process. the result of implementation of each step of the 5s methodology at xyz limited is also shown in this paper. the 5s methodology is applied to solve the problems in inspection department of the forging industry producing several crankshafts with the aim to eliminate losses in the company. the existing problem of company is dealt with is messy tool setting, bad working environment and inefficient process flow. the company cannot meet customer's demand and works inefficiently, because everyone in the company is not used to a clean working environment and all inventory interrupts the process flow; therefore the major objective of this study is to help company not only to rearrange but also reset the working environment and enhance the process flow by using 5s tools. after implementing of 5s in the inspection department the time saving is 39.60% and also certain process wastes are reduced. the inspection department in the workplace became neat and effective.","5s, crankshafts, efficiency","After the successful implementation of 5S methodology the time taken for the inspection of crankshaft is reduced to 71 seconds from 101 seconds for staff1, 73 seconds from 103 seconds for staff 2, 76 seconds from 106 seconds for staff3, 69 seconds from 98 seconds for staff4, 76 seconds from 96 seconds for staff5. Due to implementation of 5S, abnormalities were highlighted, problems were observed visually and hence action plan were taken to be solved. The number of accidents happened in the industry were reduced. There was improvement in time utilization. However the 5S implementation tools can be applied to the entire manufacturing process of crank shaft and not limited to inspection process alone. The future work will involve the application of 5S tools in service sector and lean office concept may be applied.","department of mechanical engineering veltech rangarajan dr sagunthala r&d institute of science and technology avadi, chennai ,tamil nadu, india subburaman.karthik@gmail.com",
153,Developing An Spc-Epc Unified Framework To Improve  Production Disruption In Chemical Industry In Kuwait,"the quality of products in the industry can be improved by monitoring the manufacturing process and adjusting/optimizing the process input variables based on the output deviation from the target. epc stands for engineering process control, and it is concerned with adjusting systems inputs to keep the system output on target using different types of controllers such as integral controllers and pid controllers. spc stands for statistical process control and is used to monitor processes in order to identify any assignable causes of variation. combining epc and spc as a unified framework proved to be effective in reducing production disruption in manufacturing industries. the main aim of this project is to redesign the production and quality control system in xyz chemical company by developing an engineering process controller in order to adjust the chemical process inputs to keep the output chemical concentration on best optimized target while monitoring the system using the sensitive time weighted control chart to identify and eliminate the process assignable causes of variation, improve system elements life, and reduce overall system wide costs.",,"In conclusion, the development and application of SPC & EPC unified framework has been proven to be very effective in reducing process variation and improving the product quality. EWMA control charts are very effective at detecting small shifts in the process means thanks to its sensitivity and is also able to forecast the next process error which is essential in control engineering. In this project the objective was to create a concept where we used the EWMA control chart in conjunction with the integral controller in order to keep the feed brine concentration on target in order to increase the cell membranes life cycle. SPC & EPC integration approach was done in three phases; offline monitoring phase, online measuring and detecting phase and finally the integrated SPC/EPC phase. The first phase was about analyzing the process, identifying the CTQ, identifying the key input variables and understating the process flow chart. The second phase involves analyzing the current control system. The third and final phase is where we introduce the concept which is the EWMA control chart in conjunction with the integral controller. After consulting with the process control engineers, they said by keeping the feed brine concentration on target we are able to double cell membrane lifecycle, reduce monthly cost by 50% and reduce process variation. As a whole we firmly believe that our research Concept is able to drastically improve the product quality and reduce cost. The Concept is also very versatile where it is able to easily adapt into different industries such as the oil and gas industry.

154,Price-Quantity-Setting Mixed Duopoly Models:  Market Opening,"usually, market models analyse competition between firms with either quantity or price as decision’s variables. this paper considers mixed duopoly competitions in which a state-owned public firm and a private firm produce complementary goods. we analyse, separately, the model in which the state-owned public firm sets the price and the private firm chooses the output production; and the model in which the state-owned public firm sets the output production and the private firm chooses the price. by considering domestic and international models, we analyse the effects of opening the market to a foreign firm. we also compare the results obtained with different types of decision variables. this paper contributes to the understanding of the implications of firms’ decisions on social welfare. as a result, the paper shows that, in the domestic competition, social welfare is higher when the state-owned public firm sets price and the domestic private firm sets production outputs than in other competitions. furthermore, when the market is opened to foreign firms, social welfare is higher when both firms set prices than in other competitions.","operations research, game theory, social welfare, electricity",,"fernanda a. ferreira polytechnic institute of porto, school of hospitality and tourism, applied management research unit (uniag) rua d. sancho i, 981, 4480-876 vila do conde, portugal faf@esht.ipp.pt flávio ferreira polytechnic institute of porto, school of hospitality and tourism, applied management research unit (uniag) rua d. sancho i, 981, 4480-876 vila do conde, portugal fff@esht.ipp.pt","References

157,Circular Economy In Industry: Some Insights And  Directions To Implement Circularity,"this work presents a study about the circular economy concept, based on the interest to understand how industries can adopt an innovative business model at the same time the environment’s conservation and the equilibrium between human beings and nature is promoted. this topic clearly includes both engineering and industrial management principles and that was seen as an opportunity to study the circular economy and its influence on enterprises, portuguese ones in particular, but not only. the main idea was to gather the existing information, analyze it with practical examples of its application and comprehend how an interested industry can start applying it. the particular case of a purchasing department of a portuguese company was used as test-bed. the main contribution of this work can be seen as a short story about circular economy, for non-familiar readers, as well as some directions for implementing circularity, in industry.","circular economy, industry, linear economy","The circular economy is a rapidly growing concept which is gaining momentum in a lot of everyday aspects, including the way enterprises work. It includes a mentality change and the understanding that we will need to change the way we are developing. It is not only a matter of maintaining the environment healthy, but also a way of increasing competitiveness, reducing risks, dependency and unaffordable price. It is a way of creating more jobs and preparing for the future, considering the unsustainable way human race is evolving. Some practical examples were given, with the aim of inspiring towards this idea and a practical case was presented, with the goal of critically analyzing how one’s job may include this disruptive way of thinking. Interesting future developments would be the clear application of the concept throughout the company and the critical analysis of results. Our consumer reality is changing. People look for personalized products. Millennials buy online very easily and look for specific things, making the goods selling world come closer to the service-providing one. Moreover, there is a growing trend of people being concerned with the environmental and with the way they influence it.","josé vasconcelos ferreira and ana luísa ramos govcopp/department of economics, management, industrial engineering and tourism university of aveiro aveiro, portugal josev@ua.pt, aramos@ua.pt marta miranda camoesas department of economics, management, industrial engineering and tourism university of aveiro aveiro, portugal mmc@ua.pt","references. Based on the results and the total cost of ownership (TCO), the best option is selected, and the 
supplier is awarded. In most of the cases, the buyer tries to add possible second sources, so that if something happens 
with the main supplier, another can supply the material. Because of that, the basic conditions must be ensured. This 
includes the compliance with REACH and ROHS, norms that refer to the control of substances used in a certain 
product. 
This concern is also present in the process of buying material. Buying it cannot result from one person’s work alone. 
When it is necessary to buy something, one person does a shopping cart (SC), that is approved by one or more people 
(depending on the total value) and another person must convert the SC into a purchase order (PO). Moreover, if the 
PO is altered afterwards, this change needs to be approved as well. The four-eyes rule is, this way, applied. One person 
cannot buy material alone. 
When all suppliers are selected and approved, the conditions (like price, lead time, minimum order quantity, standard 
packaging quantity and incoterms) are established and the environmental compliance assured, another department 
becomes responsible of placing orders, based on the forecast of the product. The technical buyers’ department is only 
responsible for the development phase of the project. 
Purchasing engineering members are divided into projects. Projects may be completely new or a change of an already 
existing product. In the first case, it is more common to deal with more new references, but in both cases, it is natural 
to have a bill of materials (BOM) with a lot of material that is already used in the plant. To understand if the reference 
is new or not, one shall look at its status in SAP. The status indicates if the component exists or not, if it can be ordered, 
if it is awarded to a certain supplier, if environmental compliance is checked, if it is in the tool building phase, blocked, 
to be discontinued and so on. Depending on the status of the material, the tasks to overcome are different. The status 
which normally implies more work is when a material is new. 
 
4.2 Suggestions for Circularity 
 
If the circular economy is to be put into practice, all the involved people must be informed and understand its 
importance. The leadership question is crucial. People need to understand its advantages and work towards a common 
goal. It is not enough to have managers acknowledging something if the workers on levels below do not value it. On 
the other hand, it is not sufficient to have workers that believe in something if managers do not do it. 
Each department has its set of responsibilities and tasks, but they are all interconnected and able to influence each 
other. 
In the purchasing engineering department, concern about the environment is already present; the company asks for 
compliance regarding REACH, ROHS and ROHS Future. One way to include the circular economy concept is to add 
it to the compliance report. This does not mean it should be mandatory for every supplier to have a certificate, for 
example, but to have an idea of those who are trying to apply it and briefly comprehend how. That could also have 
impact in the decision of what suppliers to contact for a certain reference. Imagine that for a certain reference, we look 
at the material group and find out there are 15 potential suppliers. Let us also imagine that, considering the expected 
purchasing volume, 3 suppliers must be contacted. The decision of which suppliers to contact is not random, and the 
suppliers are rated according to a lot of aspects. These aspects include lead times, prices, quality records, compliance, 
incoterms, conditions of payment and so on. Circular economy could also be added to the equation here, giving 
enterprises that apply it a better value when compared to others. 
Another way to show how the concept is given importance is to actually apply the concept, giving the example. Taking 
the influence power that the technical buyer can have, it would also be interesting to, in a positive way, challenge the 
engineering responsible to follow the concept. We have, over the course of this work, understood that there are simple 
things we can do that are related to the circular economy, but it is also clear that major changes will inevitably be 
needed, and those changes affect the development phase in the early phase, even before the technical buyers are 
involved in the process. The product itself must be thought of considering its immediate use and all that follows it. 
The department of Research and Development has a very crucial role here. A new product must be thought of taking 
this concern into account since the very beginning of the development. On the other hand, the company shall be 
prepared to give incentive to repairing the equipment sold. The whole mindset must be changed, and departments need 
to understand the contribution they can have to the successful implementation of such a new mentality and way of 
thinking and doing things. 
Now, there is still not a global European certification regarding the circular economy, specifically. However, that 
could be an interesting part of the solution for the future. A platform would exist to clearly inform all the concerned 
public about which enterprises include the circular economy into their processes and products and how they do it (this

Even if averaged, all ServQual attributes for MRO in Indonesia are still below customer expectations. This shows the challenge of MRO in Indonesia to be able to increase competitiveness in global level. When analyzed from the results of this ServQual there are two main things that can be the focus of MRO companies in Indonesia that is quality management and supply chain management. Therefore, more in-depth research on quality management and supply chain management based on MRO's customer needs in Indonesia is needed to improve the competitiveness of MRO in Indonesia at global level.","rahmat nurcahyo, ramdha dien azka industrial engineering department faculty of engineering, universitas indonesia kampus ui depok, 16424, indonesia rahmat@eng.ui.ac.id, ramdha.dien@ui.ac.id alan dwi wibowo agroindustrial technology department faculty of agriculture, universitas lambung mangkurat, jl a yani km 36, banjarbaru, kalimantan selatan, indonesia 70714 alan.dwi@ulm.ac.id",

167,Opportunities For Use Of Blockchain Technology In Supply  Chains: Australian Manufacturer Case Study,"the arrival and capabilities of blockchain is set to change the traditional supply chain activities. the tracking all types of transaction more transparently and securely using blockchain motivate us to explore the opportunities blockchain offers across the supply chain. this paper explores opportunities for use of blockchain technology in supply chains. particularly, examine whether blockchain technology makes a good fit for use in an australian manufacturer supply chain. blockchain allows us to have permissioned or permission-less distributed ledgers where stakeholders can interact with each other. it details how blockchain works and the mechanism of hash algorithms which allows for greater security of information. case study focuses on the supply chain management and looks at the intricacies of an australian manufacturers supply chain. we present a summary of opportunities for using blockchain technology in supply chains in an australian manufacturing case study. the summary is proposed in using private blockchain in the case study. the opportunities using blockchain technology has the potential to bring greater transparency, validity across the supply chain, and improvement of communication between stakeholders involved.","blockchain, distributed ledger","The general spread of the Internet of Things (IoT) makes the idea of integrating Blockchains in existing transaction supply chains the more significant. It will facilitate the creation of new supply chains to support the spread of sensor technologies. Supply Chains are highly complex as they involve many stakeholders who conflicting interests and priorities as well as the use of multiple systems. This paper presents an opportunity to use Blockchain to improve the current supply chain. Blockchain can enable various upstream and downstream parties in supply chain to verify the authenticity of a block of items. When stakeholders agree to work with Blockchain technology they are agreeing for an intensely collaborative journey. For this to happen, the paper describes where Blockchain can integrate its use in the flow of the supply chain. The supply chain demonstrated in the case study is a large part of an organisation and it involves internal and external stakeholders. It is possible that not all parties will participate in this technology, however, the idea is compelling as it enables private deployment of Blockchains in supply chain management. The novelty of this paper lies in where Blockchain can store all transaction information in the supply chain of the proposed case study. This will allow organisations to leverage a variety of Blockchain applications and solutions to help in the transparency, traceability and authenticity of information. The use of the Blockchain technology also creates a culture of collaboration between all stakeholders. Recently, IBM is experimenting with a system called Adept that permits exchange among billions of interconnected devices using a Blockchain approach. It has developed a semi-autonomous device based on Internet of Things concept integrated with the Blockchain with the collaboration of Samsung. This device is a kind of intelligent washing machine which can manage its own consumables supply like ordering detergent as required, perform its own self-service and maintenance, and even optimize its environment by negotiating with other peer devices in the home or outside. Technology leaders believe that Blockchain will do for transactions what the internet did for information. One potential issue that needs to be considered in the use of Blockchain is that if the first Block in the chain the geneis is created without a trustworthy source and each additional Block thereafter is also agreed on by the Blockchain stakeholders then theoretically this chain of events can be unreliable. Compared to conventional centralised databases and computational platforms (on-premises or cloud), blockchains can reduce some counter-party and operational risks by providing neutral ground between organisations [20]. Blockchain within supply chain can improve transparency and traceability from how goods are made, where they come from and how they are managed. Data in the blockchain becomes permanent and is easily shared, giving supply chain stakeholders a more comprehensive track and trace capability. For future studies we will invite domain experts to evaluate the proposed method in a real-world application. There is still much that is unknown about the blockchain-based systems [20]. Further research is required to improve our knowledge about how to create blockchain-based systems that work and creating Blockchain-based systems that work as required. 1611","elias abou maroun faculty of engineering and information technology university of technology sydney, australia elias.aboumaroun@student.uts.edu.au jay daniel derby business school university of derby, uk j.daniel@derby.ac.uk","References

170,"The Capacitated Team Orienteering Problem  Aldy Gunawan1, Kien Ming Ng2, Vincent F. Yu3, Gordy Adiprasetyo2 And Hoong Chuin","this paper focuses on a recent variant of the orienteering problem (op), namely the capacitated team op (ctop) which arises in the logistics industry. in this problem, each node is associated with a demand that needs to be satisfied and a score that need to be collected. given a set of homogeneous fleet of vehicles, the objective is to find a path for each vehicle in order to maximize the total collected score, without violating the capacity and time budget. we propose an iterated local search (ils) algorithm for solving the ctop. two strategies, either accepting a new solution as long as it improves the quality of the solutions or accepting a new solution as long as there is no constraint violation, are implemented. for solving difficult instances, we simplify the move operator of local search in order to reduce the computational time. instead of exploring all possible nodes in all paths to be moved, we only focus on nodes in the path with the least remaining amount of time. computational experiments on benchmark instances illustrate that the algorithm can generate solutions within 1% and 4% from the current best known solution for small and large instances, respectively.",and in what order,"In this paper, we focus on solving the Capacitated Team Orienteering Problem (CTOP). The CTOP is a variant of the TOP where each node is associated with a demand and a score. The main objective is to determine a path for each available vehicle in order to maximize the total score, without violating the capacity and time budget of each vehicle. Iterated Local Search (ILS) metaheuristic is proposed in order to solve the benchmark instances of CTOP. The proposed ILS uses different types of strategies for implementing operators of local search for different types of benchmark CTOP instances. For Archetti’s instances, we implement two different strategies when accepting the operators, either the operator is able to improve the quality of the solution or it only increases the remaining time budget that can be used for other nodes. For Tarantilis’s instances, the move operator is modified. Instead of exploring all possible moves from all nodes, we only consider of moving nodes in the path with the least remaining time budget. The performance of the proposed algorithm was promising. It is able to generate solutions within 1% from the current best known solution for small instances, and within 4% for large instances, giving an average of 2.20% for all instances. Since the chosen acceptance criterion has a critical influence on the performance of the proposed algorithm, a possible improvement of the algorithm could involve also considering worst solutions during the search which is used in Simulated Annealing. Some possible extensions of local search operators would be explore as future works. Since the OP and its variants, such as the Arc Orienteering Problem and the Team OP with Soft Time Windows, have attracted more attention in recent years, the proposed algorithm can be potentially tailored to solve them as well. 1636","lau1 1school of information systems singapore management university singapore, 178902 aldygunawan@smu.edu.sg, hclau@smu.edu.sg 2department of industrial systems engineering & management national university of singapore singapore, 117576 isenkm@nus.edu.sg, gordy@u.nus.edu 3department of industrial management national taiwan university of science and technology taipei 106, taiwan vincent@mail.ntust.edu.tw","References

171,Engineering Education Through Students’   Engagement In Virtual Learning Space,"virtual reality is likely to be a part of future education especially when addressing the net generation also known as generation why. delivering course material via a virtual environment is beneficial to them because it offers the interactivity and social presence. as student and educator become interconnected through collaboration and interaction, the virtual environment becomes perpetual learning experience. vr in engineering education offers the ability to explore places, simulate machines functional or practices technical processes without leaving the classroom. plus, educator can demonstrate dangerous or complex task in the virtual environment, and students can try completing the task repeatedly, minus the cost and danger. even though many studies have linked virtual technologies with improvements in students’ academic performance and motivation [1,2,3,4], students’ social and collaborative skills [5], and students’ psychomotor and cognitive skills [6,7]. the actual usage of virtual in engendering education is still relatively low. the drawbacks are caused by not enough vr content available, too expensive vr devices and difficulty in delivering vr contents to capture students’ engagement. thus, we are introducing vilecube, that aims in providing a solution by developing an interactive cross-device and cross-platform virtual learning space for building deep students’ engagement. cross-device means a user does not need to have expensive head mounted display (hmd) such as rift, but he or she could experience our virtual learning space using only smart phone or desktop computer, with or without the hmd. cross-platform means our solution could be deploy into several different platform such as android, ios and windows. interaction in our solution will be a real time interaction of voice and gesture in multiplayer setting. the basic concept of vilecube is a cloud learning environment, where engineers and students can join in from anywhere using their computer or mobile devices. inside the vilecube, engineer can directly speak and show simple gesture to interact with virtual machines parts or explain engineering concepts. gesture is control by gaze direction and locomotion sensors inside mobile devices. students are able to respond in their lesson using voice, button selection and chatting (optional). the first prototype has been develop and tested in computer engineering subject, where three problem based situations are created. the preliminary result reveals that educators and students are keen to use vilecube in their engineering subject. students engagements are measured during problem solving situation, where we found that the engagement are raise due to representation of avatar. most students felt that these avatars increase self confidence and allows them to experience more of hostile situations. 1639",,,"puteri suhaiza sulaiman department of multimedia faculty of computer science and information technology upm serdang, malaysia p.suhaiza@upm.edu.my",

174,Developing A Mobile Application For Safety Engineers For  Detailed Hazard Analysis,"a hazard is any source of potential damage, harm or adverse health effects on something or someone. hazards have big impact on individuals and the community, where hazards are the main reason behind accidents and safety problems. hazards have a high probability of happening in workplaces. subsequently, hazard analysis techniques are methods that reduce or monitor hazards in our daily life and workplaces. workplace environment have different types of hazard such as ergonomic, physical, biological, chemical, and others. hazard analysis requires a process of observation, data collection and writing a report to identify and analyze hazards. the occupational hazards can be reduced through using detailed hazard analysis techniques such as failure mode and effects of analysis (fmea), hazard and operability review (hazop), and risk assessment. since hazard analysis requires statistical data collection and writing report while safety engineers is observing the hazards, a tool such as a mobile application will reduce the time and the paper work by converting safety engineers’ observation to a report immediately. therefore, it is important to develop mobile application that will help safety engineers to assess detailed hazard analysis in a quick and systematic way. in this project, we are developing mobile application for hazard analysis for safety engineers, which will be considered as a tool ready to use during risk assessment.","mobile application, hazard analysis, safety engineering, hazards",,"fay aldallal, nojoud almutairi, mastourah alrasheedi, munerah alshadad, sarah alshadad, and suat kasap industrial engineering department college of engineering and technology american university of the middle east, kuwait suat.kasap@aum.edu.kw",

176,"Service Quality To E-Service Quality: A Paradigm Shift  Sadaf Firdous And Rahela Farooqi,",": the revolution in technology has completely transformed the way business organizations operate, serve and retain their customers. the new phenomenon of information technology has set in motion a new paradigm in the services sector for providing better services. due to the intangibility of services, it has always been challenging to satisfy the customers, and hence to measure and rate the service quality. as the information technology has taken over most aspects of our life, the delivery of services has transformed from traditional to electronic channels making its quality even more challenging to measure and maintain. the service quality has now become e-service quality. the previously established models in service quality have been rendered less useful due to the varying nature of traditional services and e-services. this resulted in the need of either developing new scales or refining the old service quality scales to suit the e-channels of service delivery. the servqual and related scales were refined and scales like e-sq, e- squal-erec-squal were established for measuring electronic service quality in today’s technology based era of service delivery. this paper aims to study the evolution of e-service quality and describes the transition of service quality to e-service quality.","service quality, e-service quality, servqual",,"centre for management studies, jamia millia islamia, 110025, new delhi, india heensheen@yahoo.com, rahela.farooqi@gmail.com",
177,"Blood Supply Chain Challenges: Evidence From Indonesia  Agus Mansur1,2","this paper aims to identify and structure challenges and opportunities for improving indonesian blood supply chain management. nowadays, indonesian blood supply chain is operated by using a decentralization approach. blood bank is one of the echelons in blood supply chain. a blood transfusion unit (btu) is a blood bank organized by the indonesian red cross (irc). an exploratory approach is used to collect empirical evidence in indonesian blood supply chain. furthermore, swot method is employed to map the identified problems and the improvement opportunities. this research conclude that the main problems in the blood supply chains emerged at the level of the btu. many btus experienced a high risk of having expired products as well as inventory shortages. the possible causes of those issues are high supply uncertainty, high demand uncertainty, and perishable characteristics of blood bag product. the three factors become challenges faced by btu of irc. the solution proposed for the btu to overcome this challenge is to initiate collaborative actions among the btus. this collaboration should be conducted in planning process at operational level. therefore, the future work is to build collaboration models for improving the blood management system, which consider the uniqueness of social demographic of indonesia.",challenge,"Blood management system in Indonesia, which is handled by the BTUs, follows a decentralization model. It needs some improvements especially in managing the inventory system. The special challenges to be solved are overcoming the stock out and expired products. Collaboration among the BTUs can be used as an alternative to improve the management, particularly in planning and operational stages. Nowadays, there are still several constraints in implementing the collaboration, both technical and non-technical. Steps that need to be done in building collaboration between BTUs are building awareness about business risks, building trust between BTUs, designing collaboration systems, and evaluating systems to make improvements. Further research is expected to build a flexible collaboration model among the BTUs in order to commit to the obligations as individual organization as well as improve collaboration. The simulation approach may help to design collaboration model to accommodate the complexity of blood management problems.","1industrial engineering department institut teknologi sepuluh nopember surabaya, indonesia. 2industrial engineering department universitas islam indonesia yogyakarta, indonesia. agusmansur@uii.ac.id iwan vanany1 and niniet indah arvitrida1 1industrial engineering department institut teknologi sepuluh nopember surabaya, indonesia vanany@its.ac.id niniet@its.ac.id",
178,New Valid Inequalities For Capacitated Plant Location  Problem,"with the contribution of sharma and muralidhar (2009) to problem simple plant location problem (splp), we now have two weak formulations and a strong formulation splp. it is noted that the total number of constraints in the weak formulation is linear, whereas the number of constraints in the strong formulation go quadratic. though relaxed weak formulations give the inferior bound but their computational time is much less compared to the relaxed strong formulation of splp. many researchers observed that this computational advantage of the weak formulation is significant for smaller sized problems however for large sized problems bound provided by it is poor. hence hybrid formulations are proposed by many. we propose the similar model for capacitated plant location problem (cplp). we modify the sharma and muralidhar (2009) weak formulations and add to them only the most promising strong constraints to have advantages of both. here in this paper, we also introduce an additional constraint that the number of plants located is less than some number ‘n’ or greater than ‘n+1’and hope that this will lead to significantly better lp relaxation bounds (we hope that this improvement will be dependent on the value of ‘n’). two criteria for computing ‘n (n1 and n2)’ are also explored. we further modify the formulation by adding one more constraint based on the assumption of opening up all plants to have bound based on simple transportation problem. this is also done with the hope of getting better bounds without causing significant computational complexity addition. key word: cplp, weak formulation, strong formulation 1. introduction plant/facility location is a vital decision in determining a geographical site for the operation of any manufacturing or service industry. it is a complex process including tangible and intangible factors. the intangible factors vary from one site to another and therefore hard to measure whereas the tangible factors like construction cost, labor cost, availability of raw materials, proximity to market and suppliers, market demand, etc. can be found. in literature, the tangible cost can be divided into two categories. first, the location-specific fixed cost and the second being the transportation cost. this problem when further constrained by the production capacity of the plant is defined as capacitated plant location problem (cplp). like in an automobile manufacturing unit, the product of cycle time and some active assembly lines determines the capacity of that unit. the cplp is a well-studied optimization problem belonging to the class of the np-hard problems for which a variety of heuristic, meta-heuristic approaches are available in the literature. we provide different formulations to compare the efficacy of the constraints that give superior lp relaxation. 2. problem formulation indices used: i : index for plants; where i = 1,2,3,…., i; i: set of possible number of plants k : index for markets; where k = 1,2,3,…., k; k: set of possible number of markets 1675",,,"r.r.k. sharma, ajay jha and himanshu rahangdale department of industrial and management engineering iit kanpur 208016, india rrks@iitk.ac.in, ajjha@iitk.ac.in, himraha@iitk.ac.in","References

179,Renewable Energy Management: Technical And Economic  Evaluation Of An Optimized Photovoltaic System,"this work explores how a photovoltaic (pv) system, can further contribute to worldwide efforts to reduce energy cost and environmental concerns by providing an overview of energy management analysis. additionally, it illustrates the economic impact of installing the proposed pv system for a selected data center in dubai, uae. a mixed integer linear programming optimization model has been proposed that uses the output of the pv panels. the proposed model minimizes cost by optimizing the pv system size, so that the required electrical load is satisfied while minimizing the cost of purchased electrical energy from the utility grid. in this model, the system efficiency, the government incentives, the potential rebates, the inflation in electricity prices, the interest rates, the system salvage value and the electricity tariffs have been considered. a cases study is conducted in which the optimal solution does not recommend using the pv system with the current electricity prices. sensitivity analyses have shown that changing the system cost to zero, i.e. offering it for free to the users by the governements, or the government may increase the energy costs from 0.57 [aed/kwh] to 1.1 [aed/kwh] through the imposition of taxes, this result in recommending installing the pv system.","optimization, pv panels, energy management","An optimization approach has been proposed to equip decision makers with the available and feasible options for switching over to energy efficient photovoltaic system installations that can satisfy the ever-growing demand for electricity. Lingo 15.0 optimization software was utilized in this work to solve the optimization model. An optimization model has been presented considering monthly average values of the load to be supplied, average output energy from the PV panels based on average peak sun hours for the UAE. Based on actual values of the parameters of this model from the case study, the PV system installation is not recommended unless the land rent cost drops to 30% of its actual cost or the purchased/sold energy prices increases to 1.1 [AED/KWh] from their actual values of 0.57 [AED/KWh]. The impact of this work will target the consumers toward renewable energy source for generating electricity rather than conventional use of burning fossil fuel and its impact on commercial and environmental impact. This work can be used for future study related to case by case implementation in residential properties i.e. implementation of optimized PV system for Villas in UAE.

181,"New Valid Inequalities For Simple Plant Location Problem  R.R.K. Sharma, Ajay Jha And Urvashi Sharma","plant location is a crucial decision in meeting the customer demand efficiently and effectively. the researchers have given different formulations for solving this optimization problem and such problems are np hard due to various integer variables and non linear formulation. sharma and muralidhar (2009) approach to model relaxed simple plant location problem (splp) resulted in two weak formulations and a strong formulation. it is found that weak formulations give an inferior bound compared to strong formulation but their computational time is comparatively very less. the reason being the constraints in strong formulations go quadratic in number. it has been observed by many that for smaller sized problems, the weak formulation of splp is superior to strong formulation of splp in terms of computational time. here hybrid formulations are proposed to accommodate benefits of both the formulations. we take full weak formulation (either weak one or weak two) and add to it only the most promising strong constraints. it is claimed that this approach (hybrid) is better than weak and strong formulation of splp in terms of upper bound and computational time. we also provide additional strong constraints based on various transportation and location costs assumptions that can improve the relaxed solutions of the splp. key word: splp, weak formulation, strong formulation, integer relaxation 1. introduction in supply chain network planning a key decision is to determine the set of potential sites for the location of plants/facilities. the objective of the facility location problem is to determine sufficient number of facilities (such as plants, warehouse, fire station etc.) in order to minimize the total cost. this problem deals with the locating the plants with unlimited capacities to serve certain markets demand (also known as simple plant location problem (splp)). the costs involved in meeting the customer demands include the fixed costs of setting up plants, and the transportation cost of supplying customers from these plants to the demand destinations. splp is well studied in literature and is considered to be the np hard problem. literature discusses various exact and heuristic techniques for solving. here we provide different formulations that compare the efficiency of various modified constraints to find the formulation that gives the best non-integer/relaxed solution. 2. problem formulation indices used: i : index for plants; where i = 1,2,3,…., i; i :set of possible number of plants k : index for markets; where k = 1,2,3,…., k; k : set of possible number of markets variable definition: xik: quantity received by the market “k” from the plant “i” as a fraction of the total market demand therefore, 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖= 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖/ ∑𝐷𝐷𝑘𝑘 𝑘𝑘 xik: quantity received by the market “k” from the plant “i” 1697",,"Here in this paper we introduce an additional constraint that number of plants to be located is less than some number ‘n’ or greater than ‘n+1’ based on contribution of transportation or fixed location cost in total objective function. We hope that this will lead to significantly better LP relaxation bounds. We also provide an additional constraint based on minimization of transportation cost (min_TrC) under the assumption all plant locations are utilized. This accommodated in formulation of SPLP will speed up computational performance. Here we wish to compare weak formulation of SPLP (constraint (2) to (4), & (6) to (8); excluding constraint (5)) with various strong formulations of SPLP (constraint (2) to (4), (5a) & (6) to (13)). It is to be noted that all constraints are linear in nature and therefore we expect significantly better LP relaxation bounds without significant increment in the complexity. 1699","department of industrial and management engineering iit kanpur 208016, india rrks@iitk.ac.in, ajjha@iitk.ac.in, urvashi@iitk.ac.in","References

It showed that mono-digestion and co-digestion of cow dung, chicken manure and pig manure enhanced biogas production and methane content under mesophilic condition (37 0C). The results indicated that there was substantial methane production potential from chicken manure and cow dung. Chicken produced the best methane production compared to the other two wastes. Pig manure indicated poor results in producing methane. When mono-digestion and co- digestion were compared, co-digestion was better than mono-digestion. The result for co-digestion of cow dung, chicken manure and pig manure yielded higher biomethane, biogas accumulation and a higher methane content than that of mono-digestion. 5.

185,Increasing Productivity In Garments Manufacturing  Through Time Standardization And Work Measurement,"process improvement among industries results to increased worker efficiency as most labor enterprises utilize the improvement of each process done in the garments production. productivity can be obtained through utilization of the available resources, a factor to speed production of goods. in this study, workers experienced delays on the sewing process of square pants garments due to inefficient worker production and the absence of time standards. these problems cause 12.62% of idle time and 5.08% unnecessary motions encountered in the production incurring php 63,600.00 total income loss per month. through work sampling, creating a production standard could serve as a basis for the worker performance in eliminating the unnecessary hand and body improvements which workers’ performance can significantly improve to 19.05% in the workers’ productivity. recommendations such as implement strict company rules, improvement in the production floor layout, rewards and incentives, provide trainings among workers, and new time standardizations can expectedly improve the whole sewing process by at least 15-20%.","garments, manufacturing, layout, time standards","The researchers were able to address the existing problems which are extension of working hours, idle time and unnecessary motions through setting time standards in each process of operation. The researchers were able to establish a much suitable working area by proposing a better floor plan that will result in maximizing the available space that later on affects the increase in the productivity of the workers. The researchers were able to reduce the 3 additional working hours to only 1 by increasing the productivity of each worker by cutting down the idle time and unnecessary motions such as chit-chatting, phone usage, waiting for next batch and procrastination. Based on the results, the proposed method has a 19.05% increase in the productivity and 26.46% decrease of the time of operation. It also shows that the new layout has a 9.60% decrease for the distances of each station. The researchers were able to reduce the operating cost from Php 259,598.88 to Php 227108.88 which shows a 12.52% or Php 32,490.00 less from the previous expense, this result to an increase from Php 160,401.12 to Php 192, 891.0 with a 20.26% or Php 32,490.00 additional for the company’s profit. Lastly, the researchers also conclude that it is more economical to have additional working hours even with their present productivity than to hire more workers based since they will only need an hour of additional work. 6. Recommendation 6.1 Controls To lessen the laziness and tardiness, the company should strictly implement the rules and regulations such as salary deduction for late comers and absentees. The researchers also recommended updating their house rules such as giving warnings, memorandum and stern sanctions but still in compliance with the labor code in order to avoid encouraging the employees to misbehave. For increasing the productivity the company should prohibit phone usage, too much chit chatting and other unnecessary things whilst outside break schedules. To avoid unorganized work station and production floor the company should provide proper storage for personal things and work related supplies. To benefit the workers, the researchers proposed to the company to give rewards and incentives to aid the lost over time pay of the workers due to the new time standards. Aside from this overtime pay, holiday pay, 13th month pay and other bonuses should be given to the workers to increase morale and satisfaction. The researchers also suggested having the workers trained to learn basic troubleshooting of sewing machines to avoid unwanted delays in the production. 6.2 Future Study Future researchers can work on moving the storage area closer to the stairs to lessen time distance travelled.

189,The Effects Of Chromosome Length On Hyper-Heuristics For  Solving The Maritime Inventory Routing Problems,"this paper describes the effects of chromosome length for solving maritime inventory routing problems (mirp) by using a hyper-heuristics based genetic algorithm (ga). the approach uses a set of heuristic combinations, each of which consist of strategies that correspond to a ship assignment. these strategies are represented by a chromosome that may have several assignments. we examine several number of chromosome length to encourage the evolution of good heuristics combinations. moreover, a variation of several number chromosome length is necessary since we do not know in advance how many ship assignments are needed to cover demands during a predefined planning horizon. at every iteration a number of chromosomes are evaluated and evolved within a ga framework. in this study, the approach has been applied on several test cases for transporting multiple oil products from a production facility to some consumption ports, by using several heterogeneous ships with undedicated compartments. the results show that a hyper-heuristics based ga reaches the same global optimal as the solutions in the mathematical model, but with a significant decrease in computational time. moreover, the use two numbers of chromosome length proves that three assignments in one step (3aios) mostly got better solutions and lower minimum total number of assignments than the two assignments (2aios).","hyper-heuristics, genetic algorithm, chromosome lenght","In this paper, we show that a Hyper-Heuristics based GA reaches the same global optimal as the solutions in the mathematical model for solving shorter planning horizon (i.e. 10 and 15 day planning horizon), but with a significant decrease in computational time. We also demonstrated the use adaptive length chromosome to solve longer planning horizon. In this method, three assignments in one step (3AiOS--) mostly get better solutions and lower minimum total number of assignments than the two assignments (2AiOS--). However, they cost longer running time. These successful results indicates that the method can be applied to larger test problems (i.e. longer planning horizon or modeling more ports, ships or/and products to be served). Moreover, the flexibility to add strategies means the method can be further extended to adapt to the various features of the problems.","nurhadi siswanto department of industrial engineering institut teknologi sepuluh nopember surabaya, 60111, indonesia siswanto@ie.its.ac.id",

Many models have considered both business and technical aspects of Business Analytics with different factors. Even though there are several models, there is still a deficiency of an integrated model with both technical and business aspects that is derived from a theoretical base. None of these models is capable of assessing all relevant factors to Business Analytics. Stage level models have defined the capabilities that should be acquired to gain maturity, though there is still no consensus in the method of assessing current maturity level of organizations. Importantly all those models contain factors in a developed country setting which can be different to a developing country setting. Therefore, a need for an integrated model with both technical and business aspects incorporating a theoretical base to assess Business Analytics maturity in a developing country setting, is identified.","kaveesha ariyarathna and suren peter department of industrial management university of kelaniya, sri lanka kaveeariyarathna@gmail.com, suren@kln.ac.lk",

199,Feasibility Study On Proposed Micro Hydro Electrical Power,"electricity is a very important energy in the modern civilization. it helps us to be productive and improves the quality of living. kappadi region of udupi district in karnataka india, faces many difficult to get access the electric energy. therefore, it is very important to find new solutions for electric generation in the rural areas (at load centers) which are cost effective and sustainable. this project aims to make use of renewable resources such as hydro energy and convert it into useful electric energy by installing a micro hydro power plant at kappadi. as per the research and based on the calculations there is a probability of generation up to 20kw power from a head of 1.5 to 3.34 meters using bulb turbine. this paper comprises all the data which will help to analyze how power can be generated with less head, also it reveals all methods which were carried out well enough to ensure that this proposal is eximious.",bulb turbine,"Micro hydro power plant [MHPP] proves to be the best alternative for power generation in remote areas especially in regions with dense vegetation and low economy. The selected site has the intensity to produce 10 to 20 KW which is very near to kappadi village. 17 houses situated near to this site, in rainy season, it’s difficult to supply power to this dense forest zone. Due to availability of source MHPP will serve 5 months without any problem. Payback period of this plant is 4 years and main advantage is already check dam is constructed for this stream. Since the head of water at bridge point was less we thought of providing a penstock to draw water for bridge point to place where we got the head as 3.18m (turbine point). To know the length of penstock that needs to be provided we carried out tachometric survey. The length of the penstock was found 89.23m. To install MHPP at site one of the necessary details required is topographical map. The topographical survey was carried to know the contour view of the site. Discharge is one of the parameter which is directly proportional to power generation. It was calculated by knowing the average stream flow velocity and average stream depth. Average stream velocity was found to be 0.212m/s and average stream depth was found to be 0.41m. By that the discharge was found to be 0.39m3/s. Power calculation is done based on the parameters of head and discharge. It was found that with our head and discharge available we can produce up to 13.79KW of energy which was found to be more than our requirement. 7.

202,A Review About Performance Management In Education  Systems: Case Of Morocco,"it is common to think about evaluation when considering performance management in education systems and vice versa. nevertheless, both concepts have risen from knowledge areas that evolved separately. recent research provided empirical evidence that evaluation, which relies on the use of performance data, enhances in practice performance management. several scholars highlighted differences between these two approaches and their possible complementarity when they are aligned. this complementarity is valid for most of the oecd countries which implemented a standards-based assessment and evaluation in education systems. a recent review confirms that ""napoleonic"" states are characterized by a strong resistance to the education system reforms brought by the new public management (npm) particularly when evaluation reports are used for performance measurement purposes. moreover, the application of npm in developing countries remains globally embryonic and complex while it is widely adopted in oedc countries. through a review of the literature, we explore, in this work, avenues to guarantee complementarity between evaluation and performance management in complex education system and how their outcomes lead to educational equity and effectiveness. we use morocco as an empirical case study to give insights about the two issues.","evaluation, education system, as a concept","Performance management approaches are widely adopted in developed countries and some developing countries education systems. Critical studies which have took interest for their effectiveness led precursor countries to improve them without abandoning them. This has allowed them to mature in the recent years. Academic or empirical research that has accompanied this implementation has contributed significantly to this development. The link between education system performance management approaches with those of the evaluation seems to give visible results for the education systems effectiveness. It could, however, constitute a real failure factor if there is a lack of consistency and complementarity. The case study of Morocco revealed new evidence in research on relevance of performance management in education system developing countries. Morocco is among the first non-OECD countries to develop a conceptual standard- based-assessment and evaluation platform which basically links performance management and evaluation approaches. Based on the findings of this works, we will investigate in future research the feasibility of a data-driven framework to potentially integrate performance management and evaluation practices in education systems. This could be the key to conquer the complexity of education systems and lead to better governance.","hind benlhabib equipe amips, ecole mohammadia d’ingénieurs, mohammed v university of rabat, morocco hindbenlhabib@research.emi.ac.ma abdelaziz berrado equipe amips, ecole mohammadia d’ingénieurs, mohammed v university of rabat, morocco berrado@emi.ac.ma",
203,Techno-Commercial And Feasibility Analysis Of  Energy Efficient Solar Powered Technologies,"in today’s era, global warming is playing a major role in raising the average temperature of earth’s surface due to rising levels of greenhouse gases. it has led to severe climatic changes worldwide, including rise in sea level, depletion of ozone layer and has had many negative effects on the ecosystem. in an attempt to alleviate these negative effects, the scientific community is focusing its efforts towards harnessing renewable energy resources and development of environment-friendly energy efficient systems. however, constraints like the initial cost and specific operating conditions for adapting these innovative technologies are of major obstacle in their practical implementation. in the scenario of a developing country like india, using solar power as a sustainable source of renewable energy is highly feasible due to its abundant availability. the present work describes three innovative products which would contribute to the indian critical and ever-increasing energy demands keeping in mind adverse environmental effects. the products described are selectively diverse and not compulsively constrained to a specific application since they are most common for domestic use in india. the working principle, return on investment analysis and methodology of product design are discussed in depth.","solar energy, global warming",,"for indian scenarios ganeshan subramanian & aimen sudhir production engineering department veermata jijabai technological institute matunga, mumbai 400019, india gsubramanian_b15@pe.vjti.ac.in, asudhir_b15@pe.vjti.ac.in mandar tendolkar mechanical engineering department veermata jijabai technological institute matunga, mumbai 400019, india mvtendolkar@me.vjti.ac.in","references [17]. Accordingly, the energy consumption of the 
conventional electric drying unit for the present analysis would be 0.22 X (3.5/4) X 14 × = 2.695 kW-hr. The 
average cost of electricity in non-residential and commercial sector in India is ₹ 7.12 per kW-hr [8]. This yields 
the electric consumption to be 2.695 X 7.12 = ₹ 19.2 per day. On the basis of market inquiries, the cost of a 
solar drying unit is around ₹ 18,800 [18] and that for a conventional electric dryer is around $ 130 (i.e.₹ 9,350) 
[19]. This offers a recovery of investment in ((18,800 – 9,350) / 19.2 = 493 days, i.e. around 1 year 4 months. 
 
3. Concluding Remarks 
 
Of the 1.4 billion people in the world who have no access to electricity, India accounts for over 160 million 
living in around 32 million homes [20]. The technologies and fuel sources that India has adopted are inadequate 
in providing the required energy and are continuously depleting. As a result of this, it could be seen that 
majority of the rural areas are completely lacking with supply of electrical energy. To overcome this, shifting to 
solar energy as a renewable energy source is proposed in the present work as India has abundant solar energy 
supply to completely fulfill its energy requirements. The present work discusses about three such innovative 
products which are environment-friendly alternatives to their nonconventional counterparts. 
The above-mentioned products play a vital role in the domestic and semi-commercial scenario in India. As far 
as the domestic applications are concerned, the prime focus must be towards satisfying the requirement in the 
easiest possible manner and in the most economical way. Many rural areas in India do not receive adequate 
electrical energy to power conventional desalination systems. This problem could be overcome with the use of a 
solar-powered desalination unit. This unit completely relies on solar energy which would ultimately yield 
extensive amount of national saving in terms of energy. Another innovative product is the solar-powered trash 
compactor which is quite useful in an urban scenario. A very high amount of waste is generated in urban areas 
which doesn’t have any proper disposal practices in India. The conventional waste compactor uses quite high 
amount of energy which is not economical. The solar waste compactor is a much more feasible solution as could 
be seen from the Return on Investment Analysis provided. The solar dryer, on the other hand, has a wide usage 
in the agricultural sector. Drying of fruits, vegetables, dry fruits, meat and flesh, etc. using conventional sources 
such as supplying thermal energy are proven to be quite slow and uneconomical as thermal energy is a low

205,Evaluation Of Fertilizer Products Storage System  Considering Seasonal Demand Using Discrete Event,"warehouse is a part of logistic system that serves to store products at each node in a supply chain. the presence of specific elements in the fertilizer products causes them not to be stored in any places as it may deteriorate the products. determining the best scenario in the process of storing fertilizers that have seasonal demand is complex. this is due to the uncertainty in the amount of fertilizer productions at each day, and also the amount of demand orders as well as the arrival time of the delivery orders (do) for each fertilizer product. in addition, when the warehouses are overcapacity, which is often the case, there is a chance that products are stored outside in the open storage (ops) or in other warehouses that are not dedicated for the products. therefore, this paper tries to solve this problem using discrete event simulation method. with this method, different scenarios are possible to be investigated without affecting the daily operational performance. this study aims to provide a recommendation for the scheme of fertilizer storage process in a company so as to reduce the opportunity lost due to product damage.","fertilizer products, seasonal demand, storage process, warehouse","Based on the research and experiment that have been done, there are conclusions can be drawn. First, the internal warehouse owned by the company has not been able to carry out its functions properly because in 2016 there was still 2.101.958 tons of fertilizer products kept on OPS. This caused products to damage and made the company suffer an opportunity loss. Second, the levels of storages often reach their maximum capacities because the demand rate of fertilizers depends on the season, i.e. the planting season and non-planting season where the demand rate of fertilizers in the non-planting season is smaller than the production rate. Inventory during non planting season will accumulate in the warehouse both indoor and OPS. Third, the experiment has shown that changing the policy by selecting the indoor warehouse over OPS has reduced the amount of products stored outside as well as the total distance traveled by the products. However, the amount of damaged product has not been decreased under this development scenario. Finally, the experimental results are not able to achieve the research objectives so that the development of other scenarios should be carried out for further analysis. This will be our next research agenda.","simulation nurhadi siswanto, sarika putriali, effi latiffianti department of industrial engineering institut teknologi sepuluh nopember surabaya, 60111, indonesia siswanto@ie.its.ac.id; sarikaputri@gmail.com; effi_l@ie.its.ac.id",
206,Investigating Curriculum Transformation Pathways In  Technological Planning Schools: Learning From Conventional,"the south african higher education terrain has undergone massive transformation through curriculum transformation involving programme alignment. there are three technical town planning schools out of the eleven town planning schools in south africa and these were the hardest hit by the curriculum changes. these technical planning schools phased out technical programmes, and introduced bachelor and honours degrees. this paper investigates the possible pathways of curriculum transformation for technical planning schools critical to the retention of practical skills training within the new programmes. the paper adopted a phenomenological case study research design and applied the qualitative research approach. content analyses were used to derive meaning from the collected data. preliminary findings reveal three possible pathways that could be adopted by the technical planning schools to ensure that new curriculated degrees produce graduates with practical town planning skills. the new degree programmes that replaced technical programmes need to place graduates and universities at par with conventional universities in terms of recognition and quality. pursuit to that, the paper recommends the infusion of the uniqueness of the phased technical programmes in the new degree programmes to deliver competitive, marketable qualifications that are preferred by students and valued by industry.","pathways, higher education, town planning","The paper concludes by acknowledging the important role the new degree programmes that replaced the technical programmes as they serve well both the graduates and the universities by placing them at par with the other conventional universities and their programmes in terms of recognition and national qualification framework levels. However it is recommended that there must be concerted efforts to ensure that the uniqueness of the technical programmes being phased out is not completely by among others infusing some of the old training packages within the new degree programmes, thus making them more competitive, marketable and preferred by the students and by extension the industry. The multiple pathways approach influences what goes inside the classroom and prepares students for both university qualification and careers. It corporates many useful improvement strategies that are already implemented and builds upon them to create a more comprehensive approach that any school can adopt to improve outcomes. Waiting any longer to support an approach may mean failing a generation of students who will leave university without preparation to succeed in careers. Multiple pathways would give more students a reason to achieve and persist in school and the tool required to transition to further education, productive employment, and good citizenship.","planning programmes and beyond trynos gumbo university of johannesburg, department of town and regional planning, office 6062, sixth floor, john orr building, beit and siemert street, 2028. johannesburg, south africa tgumbo@uj.ac.za brightnes risimati university of johannesburg, department of quality and operations management auckland park bunting road campus, johannesburg, south africa brightnesrisimati@gmail.com emaculate ingwani university of venda, department of urban and regional planning thohoyandou, 0950, thohoyandou, south africa emaculate.ingwani@univen.ac.za",
207,Exploring The Efficacy Of Blended Learning And Innovative  Assessments In Town Planning Students At The University Of,"the higher education fraternity in south africa has been undergoing a metamorphosis in response to competing demands to modernise in line with the local and international standards. the efficacy of blended teaching and diverse assessment approaches in the field of town planning has not been well documented. this work investigates the impact of blended learning and innovative assessments on town planning students’ performance and success rates. the study adopted the phenomelogical case study research design and a mixed method approach where both quantitative and qualitative data were gathered, analysed and presented. statistical, content, and document analyses were used to interpret data from students and teachers participating in blended learning and innovative assessments at the university of johannesburg. preliminary results reveal that blended learning and the application of diverse assessments methods to town planning students significantly increase and improve the success rates. the work concludes by acknowledging the positive impact of properly tailored and packaged blended learning approaches where both contact and online classes, and innovative assessments enhance understanding of town planning concepts. town planning schools need to adopt teaching and learning approaches that incorporate both contact and online learning, and assorted assessments to enhance student understanding and success rate.","blended learning, students success, town planning","Blended learning is crucial since adult students have an individualistic learning and cognitive style for processing information, which demands that distance teaching programmes include a variety of activities and learning modes, and educators use teaching models responsive to individual styles, as face-to-face meetings have their own techniques of benefiting students (Brundage and MacKeracher, 1980; Cercone, 2008; Gravani and Karagiorgi 2014). Further, the judicious application of blended learning facilitates the development of students into team players, leaders and professionals who have connected their understanding and their new found skills. In fact, blended learning assists students to work well with people also manage to work individually (Twelves and Arasaratnam 2013). The work concludes by acknowledging the positive impact of properly tailored and packaged blended learning approaches and innovative assessments that enhance an understanding of town planning concepts and students’ performance. 5. Recommendations The paper ends by recommending that town planning schools need to adopt various ways of teaching and learning by incorporating both contact and online learning to improve both access and success rates of their students. It has been highlighted that all alternatives provided for learning can be beneficial in their own unique way, hence, it is recommend to strengthen blended learning. Further, as there are students that are interested in enrolling for the programme, howerever, cannot attend classes as most of them can come as they work, and live far. This could increase numbers of students enrolling for Town and Regional Planning.","johannesburg. trynos gumbo university of johannesburg, department of town and regional planning, office 6062, sixth floor, john orr building, beit and siemert street, 2028. johannesburg, south africa tgumbo@uj.ac.za siphiwe given mbatha university of johannesburg, department of quality and operations management auckland park bunting road campus, johannesburg, south africa, mbathagiven@gmail.com emaculate ingwani university of venda, department of urban and regional planning thohoyandou, 0950, thohoyandou, south africa emaculate.ingwani@univen.ac.za",
208,"A Managerial Challenge: Selecting An Appropriate Model For  Implementing The Corrosion Management System, Case","a cms (corrosion management system) is the management system including specific documentation identifying the processes and reengineering procedures affecting the corrosion management which is basically needed for planning (plan), implementation (do), monitoring and measurement (check) and defining the corrective action (act), also the ability of the organization to manage the threat of harmful corrosion phenomenon for future asset integrity management. choosing an appropriate cms model which is fitted for gas supply chain from basic design and early engineering via installation, commissioning, operation and sweetening process, transmission, and distribution of the natural gas is the main managerial challenge for the stakeholders of this project. (note that there is no events or standard model for implementation of cms in such this case) the purpose of this paper is introducing a methodology for selecting a suitable cms roadmap.","cms, aims, csf, deming cycle, delphi method","As per ISO 55000 standard series for Physical Asset Management (PAM) requirement mentioned, Corrosion Management is an critical asset management tool, and recommended to imitate it from early engineering steps during conceptual design stages of a new projects up to end of life-cycle of any plants and assets. The recent developments and so the standard approaches are focused on risk–based orientation strategies and also integrity management practices. The case study is determined that major cost savings will be occurred by developing a risk-based approach that includes both technical inspection and corrosion management strategies. To establish a successful corrosion management system is only applicable through management commitment, effective communication, teamwork, and making sure that the capable personnel are present in the project team. In this case study, a research project is defined and the main target set to establish a native corrosion management system in order to reduce and control the effective and optimal corrosion and associated costs. As the nature of research projects, where there is no evidence for a standard method for implementation of CMS (like ISO55000 standard series requirements for PAM) in NIGC, and client managements request, the roadmap for implementation of CMS is under study and initial results (the strategic roadmap) is shown in figure 5. Meanwhile the process-oriented models for implementing native CMS in chosen pilot plants (including engineering and development projects, gas sweetening plants, a district of gas transmission pipeline including gas compressing stations) are under development. 9.

212,Multi-Objective Optimization Of Dynamic Electricity  Generation-Mix With Co2 Reduction Target:  A Case Study,"carbone dioxide emissions is a global issue which has catastrophic consequences that beyond the universal climate change. carbon emissions interact with other human demands on this planet, such as food, fibers, timber, and land for dwellings and roads. this paper presents a linear programming model for the optimal electricity generation-mix problem to meet a specified co2 emission target. the objective function minimizes the weighted sum of two terms: the electricity generation cost and the co2 emissions cost. most of the electricity generation mix problem literature considers fixed and aggregated demand and capacity over the year. however, the electricity demand and generation capacity are dynamic parameters in hourly and/or daily basis. the proposed model contributes to the literature by modeling the hourly electricity demand, daily and hourly electricity generation capacity, and daily co2 emissions limit. the model is solved optimally with a case study derived based on the electricity sector 2030 plan in south africa. results show that the proposed model proposes generation-mix plans that could achieve the co2 reduction target. furthermore, electricity generation cost and co2 emissions are eliminated.",linear programming,"The majority of the literature in the EGMP considers fixed and aggregated demand and capacity over the year. However, the electricity demand and generation capacity are dynamic parameters in hourly and/or daily basis. This paper proposed a linear programming model for the optimal EGMP to meet a specified CO2 emission target. The objective function minimizes the weighted sum of two terms: the EGC and the CO2EC. The model was solved optimally with a case study based on the electricity sector 2030 plan in South Africa. Solving the proposed model at two weighting scenarios resulted in two generation-mix plans; a minimum EGC driven generation-mix and a minimum CO2EC driven generation-mix. The former is with a lower EGC by around 6.45% while the latter is with lower CO2EC and CO2DE by around 4.41%. Both could eliminate the CO2DE, compared to the CO2DL, by around 18% and 22%, respectively. Furthermore, the minimum CO2EC driven generation-mix results in lower CO2HE over the day by around 1,136.15 ton per hour compared to the minimum EGC driven generation-mix. Further analysis may investigate the performance of the model at different points and the most compromise point is to be identified. Future extension to this model may focus on developing a stochastic model to consider the uncertainty in demand and renewable energy sources, and variations in prices.","of south africa zakaria yahia department of quality and operations management university of johannesburg johannesburg, south africa (on leave from department of mechanical engineering, fayoum university, fayoum, egypt) zakariay@uj.ac.za, zakaria.yahia@fayoum.edu.eg pule kholopane department of quality and operations management university of johannesburg johannesburg, south africa pulek@uj.ac.za",
213,Multi-Objective Preemptive Optimization Of Residential  Load Scheduling Problem Under Price And Co2 Signals,"this paper addresses the residential load scheduling problem with the objective of investigating the influence of price and co2 signals in (i) the electricity bill, (ii) the consumer inconvenience, (iii) the electric peak load, and (iv) the co2 emissions. these objectives were considered widely in the literature; however, they were not considered simultaneously in one model before. furthermore, co2 emissions targets constraint was not considered in the previous literature. this paper contributes by twofold. first, the co2 signal is drawn up based on the proposed generation-mix plan in south africa and an hourly co2 emissions limit is guaranteed. second, a multi-objective mixed integer programming model is proposed, and a preemptive multi-objective optimization approach is applied. the model is tested with and without considering the hourly co2 emissions limit. furthermore, the model is solved at four scenarios to explore the effect of the price and co2 signals and the order of optimization. results showed that the price and co2 signals and the order of optimization have remarkable effect on the appliance schedule and on the four objectives.","inconvenience, co2 emissions","In this paper, an MOMILP optimization model is proposed to address the RLSP while considering price and CO2 signals. The proposed model aimed to optimize appliance load schedules in terms of the EB, the IC, the EPL, and the CO2 emissions. The model considered an hourly CO2 emissions limit, which was defined based on the yearly CO2 emissions target in South Africa. The effect of considering the hourly CO2 emissions limit was investigated and results showed that applying an hourly CO2 emission limit could reduce the EPL significantly and could eliminate the CO2 emissions as well. Furthermore, the effect of the price and CO2 signals and the order of optimization on the resulting appliance schedules was explored. The price and CO2 DR signals, and the order of optimization over the four objectives could lead to very different appliances schedules with drastically different EB, IC, EPL and CO2 emission. These results emphasized that the hourly CO2 signal could give consumers an extra environmental motivation toward DR programs. Future work may focus on getting more compromise solutions for all objectives by applying different multi-objective optimization approaches, as well as uncertainties in appliance duration is to be considered.","zakaria yahia department of quality and operations management university of johannesburg johannesburg, south africa (on leave from department of mechanical engineering, fayoum university, fayoum, egypt) zakariay@uj.ac.za, zakaria.yahia@fayoum.edu.eg anup pradhan department of quality and operations management university of johannesburg johannesburg, soutsh africa anupp@uj.ac.za",

220,Optimal Control Applied To An Economic Model For  Reducing Unemployment Problems In Bangladesh,"in this paper, a nonlinear mathematical model of unemployment is described and analyzed for reduction of unemployed persons using two controls ‘creation of new vacancies’ and ‘skilled manpower’. for maximization of the number of employed people at the end of implemented policy, we find the control profile of two controls using pontryagin’s maximum principle. this study concludes two effective controls so that the number of unemployed persons at the end of implemented policies of the government is minimized while minimizing the systematic cost of policy making. our numerical results as illustrated in the figures strongly agree with the analytical findings.","unemployment, mathematical model, optimal control","We have presented a mathematical model on unemployment introducing new vacancies and trained persons to reduce unemployed persons with maximization of objective functional using Pontryagin’s maximum principle. After successful implementation of the policy of government, it is clear that the value of objective functional is maximized with the minimization of unemployed persons. We decide that the control of policies of government is more effective for maximization of objective functional with the minimization of unemployed persons than the no control of both policies. Hence, we believe that the numerically analyzed control profile of our proposed model can effectively reduce the unemployed persons in a country.

222,Effects Of Working Environment And Stress On Sick  Building Syndrome Among Manufacturing Employees,"unhealthy employees are inclined to be absent from work and tend to have low job performance and productivity. among the most cited causes of employees’ illness are sick building syndrome (sbs) and stress. however, empirical evidence on the effects of ventilation, temperature, lighting and noise and stress on sick building syndrome (sbs) are inconsistent and fragmented in nature. the combined effects of both physical environment and psychological state of stress on sbs have not been investigated in tandem with each other. therefore, this study focused on effects of physical aspects of workplace in terms of ventilation, temperature, lighting and psychological aspect in terms of stress on sick building syndrome (sbs). gender and age were controlled as these variables were often regarded to have spurious effects on the relationship among constructs. data were collected via self-administered survey among 447 manufacturing employees. it is found that only temperature and stress have significant effects (r2= 62.6%) on sbs when age and gender were controlled. stress has the highest beta value which indicates stronger influence on sbs. the finding indicates the importance of both management and prevention of physical and psychological aspects of workplace for reducing occupational hazard such as sbs. however, stress might pose a greater risk for employees suffering from sbs.","stress, manufacturing 2011","The findings of this paper indicate the superior influence of psychological factors over working environment. In fact, this study indicates alignment with the Herzberg’s Two Factor Theory where the presence of motivator would improve job satisfaction while the absence of hygiene factors would lead not lead to more satisfaction. In a nutshell, the working environment must be conducive for working but its inadequacies would not lead to SBS unless severe. However, stress has far reaching effect and in fact might be the mediator between the link of work environment and stress.

224,Modeling And Assessment Of Carbon Dioxide Concentration  Emitted From The Coal-Based Power Plant In Bangladesh,"a coal based power plant is considered as one of the main sources of the emission of carbon dioxide, which is the principal etiological agent for climate change due to global warming, and thus poses great threat to the sundarbans, the largest mangrove forest in the world and its surrounding regions because of a high emission rate of greenhouse gases (ghgs) such as carbon dioxide. in this paper, we propose a nonlinear mathematical model to assess the emission of carbon dioxide, produced from the coal-based power plant at rampal in the bagerhat district of bangladesh and its possible aftermath on the ecosystem. we study the process using a three compartmental ecological model which is generally used for modeling dynamic ecosystems and process to assess the concentration of greenhouse gases like co2. the model has been analyzed both analytically and numerically. the analytical findings have been validated with the numerical simulations.","coal-based fuel, carbon dioxide, climate change, mathematical model","From the above solutions, analysis, numerical simulations and figures, we can conclude that the amount of carbon dioxide will increase instantly at Sundarbans but Because of having higher carbon dioxide absorption capacity, Sundarbans will absorb almost all the Carbon Dioxide slowly and there will exist only newly transported carbon dioxide at the environment of Sundarbans. Some carbon dioxide are transported to Bay of Bengal. If the rate of transportation to Bay of Bengal increases then Sundarbans have to absorb little amount of carbon dioxide and the level of carbon dioxide will be almost same here. But the carbon dioxide absorption capacity of Khulna-Bagerhat region is relatively very low than Sundarbans but carbon dioxide transportation takes some time here. Because of this, the amount of carbon dioxide will increase slowly if less carbon dioxide will enter here. Otherwise it will increase highly and become stable after a certain time period. At power plant’s environment, carbon dioxide will increase highly but get transported to various directions through air. Since transportation is a very slow process, there exist a big amount of carbon dioxide always around the power plant.

231,The Design Of Hybrid Flow Shop Scheduling System With  Tabu Search (Ts) Method To Minimize Makespan At Pt.,"pt. plasindo elok is a manufacturer that has been producing plastic protector and packaging system specifically for oil and gas company. all kinds of product which is produced by pt.plasindo elok, have the same sequences and at several production stages, there are a number of parallel machine with its different capacity (hybrid flow shop). the existing production scheduling was based on first come first serve (fcfs). the objective of this paper is to design a scheduling system to minimize makespan which could reduce wip and total production cost. flow shop heuristic method which is used as a basis to get the optimal makespan are neh and cds algorithm. furthermore, the scheduling sequence of neh and cds are used to generate an initial sequence for metaheuristic method, tabu search (ts). the result of data processing showed that cds algorithm represented the minimum makespan compared to neh algorithm. the proposed methods cds-ts and neh-ts, produced the same minimum makespan, 14861,61 minutes with different mean flow time. both hybrid algorithm (neh-ts and cds-ts) could reduce total makespan to 1697,93 minutes or 28,30 hours. the proposed method given to the company was neh-ts with the production sequence of p10 - p12 - p13 - p8 - p7 - p4 - p5 - p2 - p1 - p11 - p9 - p3 - p14 - p6, neh-ts was the best algorithm compared to neh, cds, and cds-ts because it produced the least makespan and mean flow time. in addition to facilitate company scheduling calculation, researcher designs a java based scheduling program.","nawaz, enscore","The initial solution of CDS heuristic algorithm produced smaller makespan value compared to FCFS (First Come First Serve) method and NEH algorithm. The best result of the CDS and NEH algorithm sequences were used as the advanced method initialization stage, Tabu Search (TS). The approach of metaheuristic method was needed to find a near optimal solution with local search. According to the initial methods (NEH and CDS), CDS produced less makespan of 14861,61 minutes than NEH algorithm. But, based on the two extention calculations of the CDS- TS and NEH-TS methods, both of them produced the same minimum makespan of 14861.61 minutes with different job sequences and mean flow time. In scheduling the CDS-TS algorithm, the best job sequence is P10 - P4 - P13 - P5 - P14 - P2 - P6 - P7 - P8 - P3 - P11 - P12 - P9 - P1 with mean flow time of 7561.32 minutes. In scheduling the NEH-TS algorithm, the best job sequence is P10 - P12 - P13 - P8 - P7 - P4 - P5 - P2 - P1 - P11 - P9 - P3 - P14 - P6 with mean flow time of 7458.47 minutes. Both advanced algorithms can reduce makespan values to 1697.93 minutes (efficiency increases by 15%) or 28.3 hours from current company scheduling. The proposed job sequence for companies is in accordance with the NEH-TS algorithm (P10 - P12 - P13 - P8 - P7 - P4 - P5 - P2 - P1 - P11 - P9 - P3 - P14 - P6) because the NEH-TS algorithm produces the smallest mean flow time. The scheduling application is Java based, so it can be shared and used in any kind of OS and it is useful to simplify and quicken the scheduling calculation.

232,"State Of Model Risk: A Philosophical Discussion Of Model  Risk In The Age Of Machine Learning, Ai And Deep Learning","models are abstractions of reality expressed in mathematical terms. abstraction simplifies the underlying process and phenomenon being investigated. model risk arises when the abstraction process is inappropriate as a result of data used or model selected. model risk poses a problem for any organisation that relies on models to perform tasks and making decisions. the presence of model risk has resulted in the development of model validation techniques to detect inappropriate models. model validation techniques, such as k -fold cross-validation, has been widely adopted for statistical models and machine learning models. with the advances of newer models such as ai, deep learning and esoteric machine learning techniques, there is a need to develop the appropriate model validation techniques to manage this risk. in this paper, we discuss the philosophical issues for model validation and model limitations. through this discussion, we hope to provide possible solutions to tackle model risk as well as general principles to tackle model risk in the situation where there are no precedents.","deep learning, machine learning, model validation","and Future Direction Through the discussion about the history of model risk management, we have reviewed all the events leading up to modern day model risk management practices and challenges. We have discussed in depth of the general limitation of mathematical models and how they impact the accuracy and validity of the models used in risk management.

236,Value-At-Risk And Modified Value-At-Risk Under Asset  Liability By Using Time Series Approach,"proper risk measurement can be useful in determining investment decision choices in the financial asset market. there are several models for measuring risk, including value-at-risk (var) and modified value-at-risk (mvar). which of the two risk measures are more appropriately applied to analyze multiple stock prices, depending on the behavior pattern of each return of the financial assets analyzed. this paper aims to choose a more appropriate risk measurement model, if the return of financial assets has a certain behavior pattern. it is assumed that the return of financial assets follows the asset-liability model. similarly, it is assumed that the return data on financial assets follows the time series pattern. in this paper, we formulate var and mvar risk measurement models under liability assets. furthermore, an analysis of the comparison between var and mvar is carried out under the asset-liability model, using a time series approach. the evaluation of the performance of a risk measure has been done using the lopez ii approach. the results of the analysis show that some stocks are more suitable to be measured by var, and others are more suitable to be measured based on mvar. so, to choose a more appropriate risk measure, it depends on the behavior pattern of stock returns.","asset return, time seies, value-at-risk",,"sukono, betty subartini, herlina napitupulu department of mathematics, faculty of mathematics and natural sciences, universitas padjadjaran, indonesia sukono@unpad.ac.id, betty.subartini@unpad.ac.id, napitupuluherlina@gmail.com yuyun hidayat department of statistics, faculty of mathematics and natural sciences, universitas padjadjaran, indonesia yuyunhidayat@unpad.ac.id adam sukma putra department of physics, faculty of mathematics and natural sciences, universitas gajah mada, indonesia adam_sukmaputra@yahoo.com abdul talib bon department of production and operations, university tun hussein onn malaysia, malaysia talibon@gmail.com","References (12 font)

237,Reinsurance Loss Model At Individual Risk For Short Term  In Life Insurace,"an insurance insurer has a risk of loss. the risk of loss occurs if the insurer must bear claims beyond his ability. however, the insurer can reduce this risk by utilizing reinsurance. this paper intends to examine a reinsurance loss model developed by panjer and willmot in 1992, to process a group of data so as to produce information needed by actuaries in making decisions. here is described the steps that must be implemented, and the calculation process is assisted by a computer application program to make it easier. this model is used to meet the need for information on the distribution of total claims, premium stop loss and variance for various retention levels. the calculation results show this model is the most effective for the number of policies and small benefits. because the greater the number of policies and benefits, the more number of arrays and elements needed in each iteration and computer application program. so that it can quickly produce information needed by actuaries to support decision making.","risk of loss, reinsurance, premium stop loss, variance","This Panjer and Wilmot (1992) model can be used as an option for actuaries to support important decisions in reinsurance. Information generated from this model meets the needs of total claim distribution, stop loss premium and variance for various levels of retention. The large number of arithmetic operations and array elements needed in each iteration makes this model more efficient and effective for the number of small policies. This is because arithmetic operations and the number of elements that must be stored in the array will increase as the number of policies increases and the number of benefits we need. The greater the number of policies and benefits of the bj involved make the calculation process easier if supported by an adequate computer program and device application. This is related to the CPU time needed in the calculation process.

240,Numerical Simulation Of Finite Difference Time Domain  (Fdtd) For Solving The Boundary Value Problem (Bvp) In,"electromagnetic problem. the fdtd is derived by discretizing the maxwell’s equation using the finite difference (fn) method. we test the governing equation by numerically constructing the yee algorithm in 1-dimensional (1-d) system to describe the distribution of the transverse electric (te) and transverse magnetic (tm) within two type boundary condition. first, we simulate the system using perfectly electrically/magnetically conducting (pec/pmc) boundary condition, second with absorbing boundary condition (abcs). we assume that te and tm are propagate in homogenous and isotropic media. thereore, the conductivity σ, permeability, μ and permittivity remains constant time by time. for a further studiy, we apply the simulation to the isotropic and homogenous 2 dimensional earth layers that have a various condition of the bvp. the result leads to the conclusion that for the ideal condition of the layered earth model, the simulation is able to give a best solution for each earth layer problem.","electromagnetic, fdtd, bvp, finite difference","The FDTD method is widely used because it is simple to solve numerically. It can solve Maxwell’s time- dependent curl equations by using finite differences to discretize them. This report describes the design of 1- FDTD simulation for both TE and TM mode. This report also successfully demonstrates a working 1D-FDTD code that correctly implements PEC, PMC, and ABCs boundaries.

246,"Listing All Potential Maximal Cliques Of A Graph  Mochamad Suyudi, Sukono","a potential maximal clique of a graph is a vertex set that induces a maximal clique in some minimal triangulation of that graph. it is known that if these objects can be listed in polynomial time for a class of graphs, the treewidth and the minimum fill-in are polynomially tractable for these graphs. we show here that the potential maximal cliques of a graph can be generated in polynomial time in the number of minimal separators of the graph. thus, the treewidth and the minimum fill-in are polynomially tractable for all classes of graphs with a polynomial number of minimal separators.","graph algorithms, treewidth, minimal separators","The notion of a potential maximal clique seems to be very useful for the study of the treewidth and the minimum fill-in problems. We proved in (Bouchitté and Todinca 1999) that the potential maximal cliques are suNcient for computingthe treewidth and the minimum fill-in of a graph. In this paper, we enumerate the potential maximal cliques in polynomial time in the number of minimum separators of the input graph. In particular, this gives a polynomial algorithm computing the treewidth and the minimum fill-in for all the classes of graphs with polynomial number of minimal separators. Our generic algorithm is, of course, less efficient than algorithms working on particular graph classes. While enumerating the potential maximal cliques of the input graph, we also generate sets of vertices that do not form potential maximal cliques, so we loose time. There might also be a faster algorithm to recognize whether a given a set of vertices K of a graph G is a potential maximal clique of G than the one of Corollary 12. We feel that improvingthese two points might lead to a much better time complexity for the treewidth and minimum fill-in algorithm. A class of graphs may have an exponential number of minimal separators and consequently an exponential number of potential maximal cliques. Notice that there is no such class of graphs for which the treewidth problem has been solved in polynomial time, except the graphs of bounded treewidth. For example, the problem is still open for planar graphs. We think that a polynomial number of well-chosen potential maximal cliques could permit to compute or at least approximate the treewidth for classes of graphs with “many” minimal separators.

Furthermore, the regression process is done by forward selection method. The tests used to test the significance of the independent variables are the Likelihood Ratio test and the Wald test. The best model selection is done by looking at the value of AIC owned by model in every regression process. The independent variables that contribute significantly to the variable magnitude of claims are the cause of the loss and the year of the car, while for the number of claims are the region and the car cc.

256,Data Screening Technique For Developing A Crude Oil Price  Forecasting Models For Petroleum Industry,"forecasting studies of crude oil price depends heavily on historical data. these data should be stationary, consistent, and homogeneous when they are used for frequency analyses or to simulate a model. to determine whether the data meet these criteria, the researcher needs a simple but efficient screening procedure. such a procedure is described in this paper. a time series of crude oil price data is volatile if its statistical properties are unaffected by choice of time origin. the basic data-screening procedure presented in this research is based upon split-record tests for stability of the variance and mean of such a time series. although the stability of these two properties indicates only a weak form of volatility, this is enough to identify a non-volatile time series or to select those parts of a time series that are acceptable for use. we employed statistical package for social science to simulate the stated screening procedure to find out how good the data is for further forecasting procedures. it was found out that, after employing all the techniques, the data is found to be rich for forecasting of crude oil price for petroleum industry in malaysia.","data screening, crude oil, price, petroleum industry",,"abdul talib bon faculty of technology management and business universiti tun hussein onn malaysia parit raja, batu pahat 86400, johor, malaysia talib@uthm.edu.my nuhu isah faculty of technology management and business universiti tun hussein onn malaysia parit raja, batu pahat 86400, johor, malaysia nuhuisah33g@gmail.com","References

260,A Principal Criteria Searching Approach Based Leanness  Assessment Method Considering Industrial Diversity,"nowadays leanness implementation was more and more widely applied in production organizations to eliminate various kind of waste and reduce overall cost of business firms. during the implementation process, the incorrect choices of implementation areas may result in high cost but no obvious improvement, even the appearance of employee dissatisfaction. in this study, a leanness assessment method based on principal criteria searching approach was established. principal component analysis was used to assess and improve lean performance throughout the entire organization, qualitative factors were considered as well as quantitative factors based on fuzzy logic. throughout the identification of key leanness factors of an specific industry, a comprehensive assessment model corresponding to the characteristics of that industry was established. finally a case study of a chinese special purpose vehicle manufacturing organization was presented, the results show that the correlation among 15 different leanness factors and 8 principal indicators mainly contributed to the leanness performance, thus the overall measurement of leanness performance of several workshops could be achieved.","leanness assessment, lean manufacturing, principal criteria","The establish of a scientific assessment system, making the assessment of lean level no longer depends on subjective evaluation. Also, such method help managers find key factors for lean implementation, thus the best improvement effect at a certain cost could be achieved. As previous studies mainly focus on measuring the leanness level of organization from the perspective of integrity, the general model does not take full account of the differences in production industries. In this research, a leanness assessment method based on principal components analysis was proposed, the key leanness factors of a production industry are reflected through production related data, thus the drawback that the previous models have not considered the applicability of different type of production organizations was overcame.","1geng cui, 2fei xie and cunrong li* department of industrial engineering school of mechanical and electronics engineering wuhan university of technology 122 luoshi road, hongshan district, wuhan city, p. r. china, 430070 cuigengwhut@hotmail.com, richard_xiefei@163.com, cunrong_li@163.com ______________________________ *corresponding author (cunrong_li@163.com)",

Preparing all organizational components to change is a shared responsibility that promotes organizational members with aden aden. Two research institutions in this study have been studied quite a lot. The two research groups are responsible for the organization's potential for the institution by looking at the resources of each organization. In this study it can be concluded that this study is able to produce, build, and use resources by looking at seven organizational elements of 7 Mckinsey.

Organizational readiness to change the organization's speed measurement for correctional information appropriately. That is because there are organizations that can be accessed by organizations with sources of information and sources of information. Besides that there is an organization's ability quickly and in accordance with what is needed by the organization. This was done as a previous dimension of repeatability. Arrangement needed. And the final dimension is the innovation carried out by the organization itself in the organization. Organizational change itself is an ongoing activity and must have goals based on organizational needs. When two research institutions were able to prioritize the preparation of changes to support the success of the change, it was proven to have a positive impact on the success of the organization's change. Before making changes, the two research institutions are able to explore organizational resources, potential, know the source of the problem, and know the needs of the organization now and in the future. Based on this research, it is better for future research to be more able to measure organizational readiness in more depth with the broader subject of research. Subsequent research can be carried out at government research institutions or profit and non-profit research institutions. It is useful to build empirically about the importance and impact and variables of organizational readiness to change.

266,Application Of Spatial Weighting Matrix Of Gstar By  Using Clarans Clustering On Farmer Exchange Rates In,"generalized space time autoregressive (gstar) model was used to model the time series data that had correlation inter-location (space time). in the stage of model identification, spatial weight on gstar model shown relations of inter-location, which were weight normalized cross-correlation, binary, uniform, and inverse of distance. data grouping uses the clarans (clustering large application based on randomized search) cluster analysis method, which is a clustering method that involves spatial elements by determining the number of clusters at the beginning where each object has the opportunity to be selected as a cluster center. the data used was secondary data of farmer exchange rates in 32 provinces for 71 months from year 2005 to 2013, which has been obtained from the economic indicators published by bps every month. model candidates that have been obtained of the data were gstar(1;1) and gstar(2;1;1).","space-time model, gstar, clarans","In this paper we have analyzed that the application of spatial weight matrix of GSTAR Model can be conclude as follow: a. The Role of Matrix Weight The location at the identification stage of the model is to see how much correlation each neighbor has to a location. The Location Weight Matrix also plays a role in checking stationary and identifying candidates for the Generalized Space-Time Autoregressive (GSTAR) model. b. Model candidates for Farmer Exchange Rate data include GSTAR (1; 1) and GSTAR (2; 1.1).

273,Towards The Adoption Of Zero Waste Concept In The  Construction Industry : A Review Of Existing Strategies,"the construction industry, being the largest industry, generates massive quantities of construction and demolition (c&d) waste. generation of c&d waste leads to issues related to environmental pollution, adverse health issues, economic issues, social issues, and undesirable landfill creations. strategies such as the 3r concept (reduce, reuse, recycle), and waste hierarchy are followed in the construction industry for c&d waste management. although such strategies are applied to manage the c&d waste, c&d waste management is still in a primary stage. in order to eliminate c&d waste, the zero waste concept emerged as a potential solution. zero waste means the elimination of waste through redesigning the product lifecycle. strategies such as eco-design, industrial symbiosis, closed-loop supply chain management, innovative technology, product stewardship, life-cycle assessment, and environmental management system (ems) are employed to implement the zero waste concept in the construction industry. although adopting zero waste concept in the construction industry has several benefits, only limited studies could be found on zero waste management in the construction industry. therefore, this paper aims to review the available strategies to implement zero waste concept in the construction industry by critically reviewing the secondary data on waste management studies performed in the construction industry.",zero waste,,"k.l.a.k.t.liyanage, k.g.a.s. waidyasekara and h.mallawarachchi department of building economics univesity of moratuwa, sri lanka. kushiliyanage23@gmail.com, anulk15@yahoo.com, hmallawarachchi@gmail.com",
274,Performance Evaluation Of Sustainable Innovation Practices  In Food Supply Chain Using Best Worst Method,"the growing demand for sustainable food supply chains (fscs) is steering adoption of sustainable practices. adoption alone cannot reap the desired benefits, lest it is followed by evaluation and re-examination of the practices. this study proposes an analytical policy framework for the adoption of sustainable innovation practices (sips) in the flour milling sector with the help of an illustration of an indian flour mill. in the pursuit for sustainability, the company implemented few sips and embracing of these practices has influenced the decisions within the strategic, operational and tactical domains of the company. hence, investigation and identification of sips that have had an insightful impact on the sustainable performance of the company is needed. best-worst method, a multi-criteria technique, ideally suited in decision making environment involving multiple decision makers with conflicting judgments, is adopted in the present study for evaluation of sips. the final inference is that ‘increasing sustainability awareness’ is the most important sip, having the maximum social and environmental impact with minimum economic input. the outcomes of this case-based study can be utilized as reference for other industry managers to make key strategic decisions regarding practical implementation of sips, with an objective to enhance sustainability of their fsc.",food supply chain,"The study has attempted to present a MCDM model for performance evaluation of Sustainability Innovation Practices implemented in the wheat milling sector with specific fact findings of Delhi flour Mills Company. The company faces a tough task of attaining a productive FSC while striking a balance between complying with the sustainability regulations enforced by the government and the pressure exerted by the stakeholders. As a consequence, the challenge which lies further ahead for the company is to investigate and identify the SIPs that have had an insightful impact in the last assessment year on the sustainable performance of the company so that key decisions can be made for the next year. Nine key ongoing SIPs are identified and analyzed for their impact on the overall sustainability performance of the SC. The motivation behind the study was to provide an analytical framework to DMs so that existing policies can be modified subject to the constraints of cost-efficiency and sustainable productivity of the ongoing SIPs, keeping in mind the stakeholders’ interest and arriving on key decisions for broadening the spectrum of sustainability. Therefore, performance evaluation of the SIPs are done based on significant reduction of the total energy use and the greenhouse emissions of the SC along-with enhancement of social wellbeing, within the budgetary constraints of the company. Since sustainability is a multi- criteria concept, therefore, to assess the relevance of each SIP as compared to each other and within the context of overall sustainability, a recently developed multi-criteria method called the Best-Worst method is used. To evaluate and improve the current practices and processes, the DMs are asked to identify the best (most desirable), and the worst (least desirable) SIPs, followed by a pairwise vector comparison of best SIP and worst SIP with others. The weights of the SIPs are generated by solving a max-min model. Then, the weights of the economic, environmental and social performance are obtained using the same procedure. Finally, significance of the SIPs is obtained in the aggregation phase in terms of their importance to the organizational sustainability of the supply chain. The consistency ratio is also checked for the reliability of the comparisons made. The final inference obtained is that ‘Use of Energy Efficient Equipment’ is the most important sustainability initiative which has maximum long-term social, environmental and economic benefits. The outcomes of this study will help industry managers, decision- makers and practitioners decide where to channelize their resources during the next stage of implementation of SIPs, with an objective to enhance sustainability in their supply chain and move towards sustainable development 2433","jyoti dhingra darbari lady shri ram college university of delhi, new delhi 110007, india jydbr@hotmail.com rashi sharma department of operational research university of delhi, new delhi 110007, india rashilakhanpal9@gmail.com venkata s.s yadavalli department of industrial & systems engineering, university of pretoria, south africa sarma.yadavalli@up.ac.za p.c.jha department of operational research university of delhi, new delhi 110007, india jhapc@yahoo.com","References

275,An Interpretive Structural Model For Analyzing The Impact  Of Sustainability Driven Supply Chain Strategies,"the existing ecological imbalance along with the rising social disparities are driving companies towards consideration of adoption of sustainability driven supply chain (sc) strategies which aim at a holistic integration of the economic, ecological and social enhancement of the overall sc. however, the challenge lies in consideration of triple bottom line (tbl). further, increasing demand from stakeholders for accountability of the sustainability practices has put immense pressure on companies for assessment of their sc activities in terms of sustainability. however in few developing nations like india, even though companies are required to examine the environmental as well as social ramifications of their sc activities, most firms are still focused more on the economic productivity. this brings us to the motivation behind this research, in which a multi-criteria analytical framework is developed for a manufacturing firm for identifying the sustainability practices, which can aid the firm in simultaneously improving on tbl. interpretive structural modeling (ism) is utilized for establishing relationships between sustainability strategies identified through extensive literature review and semi-structured interviews with decision makers. through the analysis of the ism model developed for the case-based study, it is validated that environmental and social sustainability enables economic sustainability in the long run.",,"Continuous environmental deterioration and depletion of natural resources are forcing nations to look into innovative ways for incorporating sustainability practices. Governments are hence enforcing strict regulations on the firms to resonate sustainability into their SC that will result in economical, ecological and social benefits. Environmental improvements for nations like India are not only essential to attract new customers but also for a sound future. Identification and effective implementation of the right sustainability practices is still a challenge for most firms, particularly in the developing nations. In order to overcome this problem, our research seeks to identify the strategies of sustainability for firms in India and analyze interrelationships among them. Further the study helps in identifying those strategies that can aid an Indian electronics-component manufacturing firm to achieve overall sustainability of the value chain. ISM methodology is implemented for this purpose along with MICMAC analysis. A total of 18 strategies are identified from rigorous literature survey, which are used for evaluation of sustainability performance of the SC. The study resulted in the following observations: MICMAC analysis shows that none of the strategy was obtained in the autonomous-quadrant and only three strategies were in the dependent-quadrant which shows that there is less instability among the selected ones. That means waste reduction, supply chain risk and customer satisfaction need better attention by DMs, as there is still scope for improvement in them. Linkages-quadrant consists of maximum number of strategies, as this quadrant illustrates high driving/dependence power, which clearly shows the potential of these strategies in influencing the overall SC performance. Further, strategies constituted in the independent-quadrant holds most importance, as focusing more on these can lead the electronics-component manufacturing firm towards higher sustainability score. The relationships among the strategies are demonstrated with the help of the diagraph (Figure 2). Implication drawn from the model is that Government rewards and recognition, management commitment and customer involvement are most essential strategies for the firm. So a firm working towards making its practices environment friendly, incorporating all the parameters defined by the government, gets recognized and rewarded. ISM model shows a practical case of an Indian electronics-component manufacturing firm, which will help DMs for focusing on improving those sustainability strategies that will eventually aid in improving the overall performance of the firm. Our study can be applied to the general electronics industry. Although the DMs’ opinions may change as per each firm’s requirements, however the validity of the judgments can be checked used structural equation modeling (SEM) in future.","rahul solanki and p.c. jha department of operational research, univeristy of delhi, delhi-110007 solanki.rahul1470@gmail.com, jhapc@yahoo.com jyoti dhingra darbari department of mathematics, lady shri ram college, university of delhi, delhi- 110024 jydbr@hotmail.com vernika agarwal amity international business school, amiy university, noida, uttar pradesh 201313 vernika.agarwal@gmail.com",

277,Development Of Food Safety Plan For Food Parks In The  Philippines,"food park concept started out in the philippines in 2016 and has conquered the food and beverage industry in the country. throughout this year, food parks and food trucks alike have sprouted in every corner of the metro. in a report by manila times business, demand for sites for building food parks saw a significant rise in the country, mainly driven by the millennial market (yu, 2017). however, regulations regarding food safety and hygiene are poorly observed in the food parks. as such, increasing incidence of foodborne diseases and foodborne illnesses were reported. this study therefore aims to evaluate the current food safety practice of food park industry in the country and develop a food safety plan in order to minimize the occurrence of risk for foodborne diseases and illnesses. the study made use of service blueprinting in order to identify the failure points in the food handling process and rubrics-scoring method was used in order to identify indicators in food handling and preparation that contribute to foodborne diseases. finally, statistical analyses such as analysis of variance and regression analysis were utilized in order to determine significant factors in food handling and preparation that directly contribute to prevalence of foodborne diseases. the factors identified in the study will serve as the basis for the authors to develop a food safety plan for food parks. the food safety plan consists of policies and procedures for food handling and preparation, which consists of personal hygiene of food handler, food hygiene and safety practices, use of materials, and management of leftovers/trash. the findings showed the inadequacy and lapses in the current food safety practices in food parks, showing the relationship of food-borne diseases and its occurrence in different indicators that are common to food service today.","food preparation, foodborne diseases, food safety plan","The findings have shown the inadequacy and lapses in the current food safety practices in food parks, showing the relationship with food-borne diseases that are common to food service today. Among the significant variables is how the food handlers’ hygienic practices and attitude towards food safety affects the safety of food items such as cooked food, dessert, and beverages being sold in different stalls in food parks, which can lead to health hazards such as infections and diseases. Although most food parks are checked by the respective local government they operate in before the issuance of health and sanitary permits, not all are kept monitored on a regular basis thus resulting to lapses in the food parks’ safety procedures in food handling and processing. Lapses in food handling and processing can result to food-borne diseases, with some being easily transferred through physical contact and others through cross contamination. Some of these food-borne diseases can be as simple as Salmonella, which usually results to vomiting and stomach ache, but there are also much severe diseases like E. Coli which may result to kidney failure and even fatality in much severe cases. Based on the results, it is evident that failures by food handlers to do their tasks properly, which involves food handling and processing as well as their personal hygiene, can easily lead to cross contamination and infections on the food items. It is also significant to understand that all the materials and equipment used in food handling and processing also affects the safety of the food items being sold in food parks. That is why proper cleaning and maintenance of materials and equipment are very important aspects in food safety. The researchers used service blueprints to observe and identify the failure points in food handling and processing common in food parks, and utilized a checklist based from a food safety study conducted in Nigeria and modified it to better fit the specific needs of food parks, with tasks containing different variables grouped together. The results showed low scores on variables related mostly to food hygiene, personal hygiene, materials handling, leftovers and trash management. Existing personal gears for food handlers such as hairnet, hand gloves and spit guard are not usually available or used in food parks, which if used properly can help in prevention of cross contamination, infection and spread of diseases. Some food handlers also commit mistakes in separating raw and cooked food items, which can easily cause cross contamination. Materials handling, trash and leftover management are also some of the overlooked variables in food safety, which if not properly taken care of may cause cross contamination to food items and become a place of incubation for bacteria and pathogens. 2460","madonna f. andarada, rolph fahad christopher c. bigtas and manuel u. ribo, jr. school of industrial engineering and engineering management mapua university intramuros, manila mfandrada@mapua.edu.ph, rcbigtas@mapua.edu.ph, muribo@mapua.edu.ph","References

278,An Ergonomic Design Of Birthing Chair For Public  Maternity Hospitals In The Philippines,"this study aims to design an ergonomic birthing chair for public maternity hospitals in the philippines in order to provide comfort for patients and maternity healthcare workers. previous studies prove that for normal delivery, patients giving birth in sitting position provides 30% more ease compared to lateral position. in addition, healthcare workers are also exposed to less risk for musculoskeletal disorders if they are in sitting position when assisting patients compared to standing position. in this regard, the researchers intend to design an ergonomic birthing chair for patients with an adjustable chair for healthcare workers by applying the principles of anthropometry that is fit for filipino users. ergonomic assessment tools such as cmdq and rula were used in order to determine the risks of workers for msd due to the current design of birthing bed for normal delivery. statistical tools such as analysis of variance (anova) and correlation analysis were also used in order to determine significant factors that contribute to the msds of healthcare workers in maternity hospitals. the result of cmdq and rula indicated that musculoskeletal disorders are evident in the following: (a) obstetricians: wrist (95.2%), thighs (86.9%), shoulders (69.05%), forearms (60.7%) and lower back (52.4%); (b) midwives: knees (81.5%), wrists (78.8%), lower back (72.4%) and shoulders (72%). statistical analysis proved that task factors such as positioning, supporting baby’s head as it emerges, supporting baby’s neck using both hands, delivering placenta and final positioning significantly contributes to the msd experienced by workers. thus, the new design of birthing chair proves significant reduction of msds for healthcare workers and provides more comfort for patients.","maternity hospital, birthing chair, ergonomic design","Based on the result of the analysis, the following conclusions were drawn. First, the result of CMDQ revealed that obstetricians and midwives experienced musculoskeletal disorders due to current design of birthing facility in the public hospitals in the Philippines. The RULA analysis proved that the subjects were exposed to awkward postures and use of muscular force, hence, are exposed to risks for upper limb disorders. The result of the regression analysis showed that the following tasks significantly contribute to the musculoskeletal disorders of the subjects: positioning, supporting baby’s head as it emerges, supporting baby’s neck using both hands, delivering placenta and final positioning. With that, the researchers were able to come up with an ergonomic design of birthing chair focusing on the tasks that contribute to the musculoskeletal disorders of the subjects. The design is based on the anthropometric measurements gathered from the subjects of the study and using AutoCad software, the researchers made a mock-up design prototype. 2468","rianina d. borres and angeli k. javier school of industrial engineering and engineering management mapua university intramuros, manila rdborres@mapua.edu.ph, akjavier@mapua.edu.ph","References

281,Predictive Model Affecting The Fatigue Condition Of Drivers  In The Philippines,"public transportation has been evolving through the past years. the latest mode of transportation is the application based rides also known as the transport network vehicle services. it has always been the safety of the passenger that is being prioritized. drivers’ health condition should also be taken into consideration especially now that there are an increasing number of deaths among the drivers due to accidents mainly caused by fatigue. in this regard, the study aims to determine factors affecting the fatigue condition of drivers in order to ensure the safety of drivers and their passengers. the study also aims to design a smart watch that will monitor the fatigue level of drivers in order to prevent untoward incidents that will affect the safety of both drivers and passengers. factors such as blood pressure, heart rate and oxygen level were considered in the study. the researchers made use of statistical analysis such as analysis of variance, correlation and regression in order to determine which factors are significant predictors of the fatigue level of drivers and thus, the factors identified will be considered in the design of the smart watch that will monitor the fatigue level of drivers.","fatigue, health condition, transportation, there are buses","Based on the result of the study, the following conclusions were drawn: Correlation analysis was used to prove that factors in demographic, road and environmental that have significant relationship to the fatigue condition of the drivers in terms of the following: blood pressure, heart rate and oxygen level. Different factors and sub-factors were identified to have positive and negative correlation to the fatigue condition of the drivers. Regression model was developed in order to predict the heart rate, blood pressure and oxygen level of the drivers with the corresponding time of the day using regression analysis. These factors served as the basis for the researchers in designing a smart watch that will monitor the health condition of the drivers in order to ensure safety of both drivers and the passengers. Using the factors identified in the study, the researchers were able to come up with a proposed design of smart watch that will efficiently monitor the health condition of the drivers.

282,Development Of Supply Chain Model For Small Scale Farmer  Producers Of The Carrageenan Industry In The Philippines,"the growing industry of carrageenan continues to be characterized by small-scale farmer producers whose collective production of agar is the major supply source of the marine produce in the city. however, the multiplicity of farmers engaged in the production contributes to what is an emerging industry in the city as it is in many southern islands. the aggregate production of the agar farmers in the city is sufficient to make local farmers potentially competitive and a major source of supply for the marine product. thus, the study aims to identify and evaluate the various factors to the market conditions of carrageenan in the southern philippine area – production, price, and distribution channels – and to design solutions that would reduce the cost of distribution in the seaweed supply chain. the process involved the conduct of a survey and interviews of several stakeholders in the industry who acted as the study’s key informants. statistical tools and other analytical tools were likewise employed to further identify the factors that contribute to the current supply chain of the carrageenan industry in the country. statistical tools were employed in the analyses to identify the factors and optimal distribution cost and based on the results. three specific areas were considered for the farmer-producers: quality standards, growth and maintenance, and harvest conditions. as with the buyers: quality, transport, and selling. the final group – the assemblers - the areas include quality, transport and selling. however, the least two groups seemed almost identical, the specifics in each of the areas covered had varied operational conditions. as with the farmers, 77% was lopsided for e. espinosum variety; 1005 for the use of the floating planting method, and 85% for water movement as a special maintenance concern of the plants. in reference to growth and maintenance, a majority over 80% opted for planting of cultivars within the 1.5-2 meters deep and of cultivars within 15 to 20 centimeters in length. farmers opt to do once a day inspection of the farms and there is almost 100% preference for still water conditions in the planting area; a significant 81% of framers prefer water temperature of around 25 degrees celsius, salinity of 20-25 parts per million and all opt for sandy sea bottom. for the buyers, in reference to quality, a high 80% prefer agar to be sold to them with 25% moisture content; note that most sold to them are combined with sand; and prefer e. espinosum and e. cottonii. in reference to transport, distance from farm to buying station is on the 16-km. distance on the average; the use of truck by all of them; and prefer that seaweeds be covered in the course of transport. with the assemblers and bodegas, all have shown preference for 25% moisture content of the agar and have noted the mix of sand in most of them; there is a very high preference for e. espinosum over other species; and their storage areas are 0ver 800 square meters. in reference to distance, the similar 16 kilometers average is noted; the trucks are generally covered during transport; and the movement of produce is done daily. as with selling, storage prior to actual sale takes between 2 to 3 weeks; these are sacked; sale is preferably done during the drier days and frequency of sale is done twice to thrice a week.","supply chain model, quality, price","The current supply chain in terms of its structure is not the optimal for the sustainability and maximization of its potential. There are many aspects where in there are much room for improvement but the integration of technology for the farming practices shall greatly affect the supply chain in a positive way. The involvement of the government in terms of microfinancing the needs of the farmers, continued education of updated farming techniques and improving infrastructure around the area will greatly increase the chances of making the supply chain sustainable. Introducing the private sector to get involved shall promote the improvement of the quality of living of the players in the chain. The first objective of the study was to assess the prevailing supply chain of the carrageenan industry in the Zamboanga region. The data-gathering process involved the assessment of the industry on-site with the employment of observations and interviews with the sample of three groups of major seaweed industry players in Zamboanga City. While the agar industry may be “old” and familiar to much of the current farmers, the industry has since changed given the demands of the market. It has become more specialized with the involvement of defined groups as the buyers and assemblers performing identified functions. The second objective of the study is to identify the factors affecting the supply chain. From careful research analysis, factors affecting quality, production volume and marketing were carefully investigated and analyzed. From the standpoint of the Farmer-Producers, three areas were identified: Planting Quality Standards, Growth and Maintenance, and Harvest Conditions. For the buyers, three factors were identified: Quality, Transport, and Selling. The last group of players – the assemblers, also involved three areas closely similar to those of the Buyers: Quality, Transport, and Selling. The factors that were identified to be significant that has the most effect on the output of seaweed are the following: Species of seaweed, monitoring of the plantation, planting intervals, harvest months, and type of drying beds. The species of seaweed affects the production because different types have varying amounts of growth time. The monitoring of the plantation, specifically line inspection and deceases have significant effects because these can reduce the output if not monitored. Harvesting months and type of drying meds are also significant because post-harvest practices entails the drying of the seaweed. And seaweed cannot be sold if it contains high moisture contents, so preferred months are peak of summer and mode of dry are racks to minimize contamination. The third objective was to develop a supply chain model/framework and strategy to improve the industry performance. The development of a new value chain map, were in there are two major phases. Farming activities and Marketing activities. Under the farming activities, will fall under the supervision of a farming cooperative made up of the farmers themselves. The creation of the cooperative to watch over the farming activities to be better facilitate the farmers. They could organize among themselves with government assistance. This is wanting given the need for their increase bargaining position in the market – securing their products and their prices. Moreover, they could be the more legitimate link to the actual local market. The intermediate marketing phase is focused on the domestic/local market that act as enablers and conduit to the assemblers, who, in turn links to the foreign market. The first line of quality control is the local market who is aware of the foreign market requirements. The major concern is the transport of the produce to the buyers/bodegas. In all phases, quality must be carefully secured. The “fate” of the farmers are ultimately sealed by the actual sale. The link to the assemblers is the beginning of the entry of the foreign market. The assemblers hold the legitimate link to exportation where the ultimate crucible of quality is determined and reflected by the price paid for the produce. Again, the persistence of Quality is evaluated.","mary christy o. mendoza and raphael joesh p. layug school of industrial engineering and engineering management mapua university intramuros, manila mcomendoza@mapua.edu.ph, rplayug@mapua.edu.ph",
283,Effects Of Internal And External Sources Of Distraction To The  Driving Performance Of Filipino Drivers,"driving is a primary task that requires full attention. however, several factors could cause distractions and affect the attention of drivers. distractions come from both internal and external sources. internal distractions happen when a person engages into distracting activities inside the vehicle (beanland et al., 2013) while external distractions come from outside of the vehicle wherein there is a delay in recognition of information needed to safely accomplish the driving task because there are events, activities, object, or person outside the vehicle that tend to induce the driver to shift his attention away from the driving task (regan et al., 2011). both external and internal distractions contribute to the interference of focus (post and schumm, 1997). thus, this paper aims to analyze contributing factors in internal and external sources that affect the attention of drivers in the philippines. design of experiment (doe) has been used to simulate a model for driving performance of subjects to determine the effect or impact of factors in internal and external sources to the attention of drivers. contributing factors of internal sources that were considered in the study are tasks, age, gender, driving experience and type of license used by drivers while factors for external sources include pedestrian crossing, vehicle cuts-in, vehicle emergency brakes and vehicle counter flows. on the other hand, measurements on the impact of driving performance that were considered in the study are change in speed, lane departure and collision count. statistical analyses such as analysis of variance and cramer’s v test were employed in the study to determine the relationship of contributing factors to the impact of driving performance. the results of the study showed that among the contributing factors in the internal sources, eating while driving has the highest impact on the driving performance of subjects while for external sources, all contributing factors have significant impact on the driving performance of subjects. therefore, the result of the analysis will serve as the basis for the researchers to propose policies and regulations to help drivers avoid driving distractions and ensure road safety.","driving distraction, road safety","Based on the result of the experiment, the following conclusions were drawn: (1) The result of initial survey revealed that subjects were exposed to different types of distractions while driving both from internal and external sources. From internal sources, majority of the respondents are exposed to distractions such as phone conversation, adjusting the radio, eating, drinking and talking to passenger. For external sources, respondents are exposed to distractions such as pedestrian crossing, vehicle cuts-in, vehicle emergency brakes, and vehicle counter flows. (2) The result of the analysis of variance proved that internal and external distractions that affect the driving performance of respondents in terms of change in speed, lane departure and collision count differs in terms of gender of drivers, years of driving experience and type of license use. (3) Cramer’s V test revealed that for internal sources of distraction, factor that has the highest effect of driving performance is eating, while for external sources, factors that affect driving performance are pedestrian crossing, vehicle cuts-in, sudden breaking and vehicle counter flow. 2512","rex aurelius c. robielos and ybeth angelyn p. tuliao school of industrial engineering and engineering management mapua university intramuros, manila racrobielos@mapua.edu.ph, yptuliao@mapua.edu.ph","References

284,In-Depth Analysis Of Workplace Accidents In Food   Processing Company In The Philippines,"the study aims to investigate the causes of accidents among the food processing company in the philippines by analyzing 82 cases of accident reports which could help in the development of preventive strategies and safety plans for companies in reducing the occurrence of workplace accidents. in order to perform an in-depth analysis of accidents, the researchers first categorized the factors associated with the accidents based gender, age, type of work, shift, extent of disability, accident type, body part affected, place of injury, nature of injury and other contributing factors. then, statistical analysis such as cramer’s v test were performed in order to determine the significant associations among factors considered in the study. afterwards, task analysis using failure mode and effects analysis (fmea) is employed to determine the detailed task, percentage of responsibility and the failure points that led to the accidents. and finally, cause-responsibility analysis such as occupational accident tree analysis (oata) and occupational accident component analysis (oaca) were used in order to determine the root causes of accidents and identify the percentage responsibility of worker and company towards the accident. the result of the analysis showed that place of injury and contributing factors were the most significant factors that led to the accident of workers. these findings helped the researchers in developing preventive strategies and safety plans for the companies to reduce occurrence of accidents in the future.","workplace accidents, food processing, accident reports","The study applied statistical analysis and cause-responsibility analysis on 82 cases of accidents in a food processing company to evaluate causes associated with all the factors given. A complete coding and classification was developed to analyze and coded each accident in terms of the victim’s age, gender, the type of worker, shift, place, type and nature of injury, body parts affected and contributing factors. Similar to the study of Chi et al., (2017), coding scheme was able to identify factors contributing to the accidents. Contributing factors such as insufficient/ inadequate illumination, exposure to chemical substances, deficiencies in personal protective equipment and poor housekeeping and cleaning mostly have damaging effects on the workplace accidents were associated with place and type of injury derived through analysis of Cramer’s V by applying multi-linear event sequencing method. With the support of the practical information and tools of Task Analysis, FMEA and Cause-Responsibility Analysis, identification of hazards, determination of accident causes, responsible groups and their role on accident as well as the responsibility rate (Jabarri et al., 2016) were determined to enhance safety of workers. As a result of using Cramer’s V as well as the CRA technique on the 82 cases the results confirmed that the study was well applicable to achieve the objectives of the research. For responsible groups involved, the analysis of this research can be useful as a way of adding relevant knowledge to the management of workplace safety (Carillo-Castrillo et al., 2013) and can be used among other risk assessment, preventive plan and safety measures in any food processing company. Future researches may be extended to assess the effectiveness of these tools by developing Probabilistic Risk Assessment and Fault Tree Analysis approach particularly on the analysis of accidents.","rex aurelius c. robielos, kenn redric p. leyba and charlene l. ocampo school of industrial engineering and engineering management mapua university intramuros, manila racrobielos@mapua.edu.ph, kpleyba@mapua.edu.ph, clocampo@mapua.edu.ph",

290,Carbon Pricing As A Policy Instrument To Reduce Energy  Based Emissions In Apparel Sector,"price based emission reduction instruments are deemed to be effective in achieving emission reductions, as they induce emission reductions through price signals, and also generate revenues which can later be used. among all, carbon tax systems and emission trading schemes are identified as the most popular pricing instruments. the success of a carbon pricing instrument heavily depends on the way the firms respond to it after the implementation. however, a study conducted on assessing the response of firms is not done. hence, this research was aimed at evaluating the response of firms to carbon pricing instruments in sri lankan apparel sector. initially, a comprehensive literature review was carried out from which a conceptual framework was developed, indicating how carbon pricing policy instruments are derived from principles of environmental economics and five decision alternatives available for firms in response to carbon pricing instruments. from the expert interviews it was found that the above decision is influenced by three decision criteria, which indicated analytic hierarchy process (ahp) as the best method to identify the response of firms. hence, as a part of this study, hierarchical structure of ahp was developed using the findings of literature review and expert interviews.",carbon tax,,"t.l.w. karunaratne and t.s. jayawickrama department of building economics university of moratuwa sri lanka tkarunaratne.uom@gmail.com, tsjayawickrama@yahoo.com","References

291,Issues In Implementing Business Process Reengineering  (Bpr) Projects,"business process reengineering (bpr) is a technique for critical analysis and radical redesign of prevailing business processes to obtain improvements in performance measures. though bpr projects seem promising and offer many benefits to organisations, researchers have found that typically around seventy percent of reengineering projects fail in action due to various issues. thus, the purpose of this paper is to identify the issues which may have significant impacts on the successful implementation of bpr projects. four case studies were conducted to identify the issues faced during actual bpr project implementation. thirty (30) unique issues faced by the organisations in different phases of the reengineering process (i.e. pre-bpr implementation phase, bpr implementation phase and post-bpr implementation phase) were identified. it is hoped that the findings of this study could facilitate the practitioners in identifying the issues in implementing bpr projects that should be given enough consideration to assure the success of bpr projects.","case studies, implementation","Though BPR is considered as a key technique to alter the business processes within organisations to attain greater improvements in business performance, around seventy percent of BPR projects have resulted in failure (Dennis et al. 2003; Hammer and Champy 1993; Malhotra 1998; Nauman Habib 2013). This high failure rate of BPR efforts has raised the need for identifying issues in implementing BPR projects which may have substantial impact on BPR project success. Through four (04) case studies, altogether thirty (30) issues faced by the Sri Lankan organisations in implementing BPR projects were identified under three phases (i.e. Pre-BPR implementation phase, BPR implementation phase, and Post-BPR implementation phase). ‘Lack of top management commitment and support’ was the key issue identified in Pre-BPR implementation phase, while ‘resistance to change’ and ‘project participants’ conflict between team responsibilities and functional responsibilities’ were the key issues faced in BPR implementation phase. On the other hand, ‘difficulty in measuring reengineering project performance’ was identified as the key issue faced in Post-BPR implementation phase. The findings of this study are useful for the practitioners in identifying the issues in implementing BPR projects that should be given enough consideration to assure the success of BPR projects. This research has opened up the opportunity for some new research directions, which could be done in the future. Since, in the existing literature there is no practical framework to guide the organisations in successfully reengineering their BPR projects, developing a framework for the successful implementation of BPR projects can be considered as a vital future research area.","m.f.f. fasna & sachie gunatilake department of building economics university of moratuwa sri lanka fasna.fm2013@gmail.com, sachieg@uom.lk",
292,An Assessment For The Use Of Green Building Information  Modelling For Sustainable And Green Buildings – Sri,"the purpose of this research was to assess the applicability of integrating building information modelling for sustainable and green buildings in sri lankan context. a comprehensive literature survey was conducted first to review the existing knowledge on bim integration to green buildings, green bim techniques used and data requirements for the use of green bim. subsequently, a single case study was carried out to practically apply the green bim technology. the selection of the case was based upon the availability of data required to use bim integrated sustainable techniques. thus, the data availability was analyzed first through a questionnaire survey including the data identified from literature. based on the findings of questionnaire survey, an existing green building was selected for the case study. a framework was developed including the steps to be followed for the use of green bim for selected green building. the research findings revealed that, though bim was not well established technology in sri lankan construction industry, there is a potential for the use of green bim in existing green buildings, if the required data are adequately and accurately available.",green buildings,"that since the data are available in existing green buildings, there is a potential to use Green BIM technology for the existing green buildings in Sri Lanka, even though BIM has not been implemented during the early stages. 5. Conclusions According to the aforementioned findings, though the data availability appears to be numerically satisfactory, there could be issues due to the lack of accuracy and reliability of data, which are hidden and invisible until practical implementation is initiated. Hence, even though the data are available apparently, a proper examination should be carried out in order to realize the accuracy and actual availability of data up to the accepted level. However, as this study was able to conduct energy analysis of Green BIM, it can be concluded that, there is a possibility of using Green BIM techniques for existing green buildings in Sri Lanka. However, further studies need to be undertaken to identify and evaluate this applicability when the level of data availability is different in green buildings.

Palm oil waste processing industry such as old trunks, bunches of empty shells, and have not grown commercially. Almost all group companies have a PKO factory processing seeds of palm kernel oil becomes. Generally the PKO factory built to absorb the oil from the nuclei of several other mills in the group. Manufacturer of PKO will generally utilize by-product called Palm Kernel Expeller (TCE) as a raw material for animal feed.

297,Integration Of 360-Degree Feedback Methods And Ahp For  Employee Performance Measurement,"assessment of employee performance is important in improving company performance. performance appraisal takes into account factors that support employee performance in accordance with the aspects reviewed. usually performance appraisals are carried out only by direct supervisors. the existence of differences in the results of the assessment of superiors with perceived employee perceptions, often results in employee dissatisfaction. performance appraisal will be better if it involves more than one assessor. a 360 degree feedback method is a method of assessment by involving superiors, peers, and self assessment. integration of 360-degree feedback methods and analytical hierarchy process (ahp) are used to improve assessment results. the application of this method was carried out on nurses in the care ward of one mental hospital, involving 52 people, consisting of 12 superiors and 40 employees. the results show that the priority factors that influence nurse performances are work competency factors. there is a difference in the value of the gap between the assessment of superiors and employee ratings. the method integration has proven to have reduced the assessment gap level, so that the assessment results will be better.","productivity, mental hospital, nursing ward","Employee performance appraisal is often crucial. The subjectivity of the assessor can influence the results of the assessment. Appraisers can provide different assessments of employee perceptions. Separate performance appraisals between superiors and co-workers with the value of the employees themselves will make a difference. This difference in value is called a negative gap. Employee valuation methods that involve many parties will result in a better level of assessment. Employee assessment methods that integrate 360 degree feedback and AHP can be used to reduce the negative gap value that occurs. In the case of nurses in mental hospitals, the results of the performance appraisal were sufficient to satisfy the employees.","much. djunaidi, virna s.d. kumaraningrum, indah pratiwi, and hafidh munawir department of industrial engineering universitas muhammadiyah surakarta sukoharjo, central java, 57162, indonesia much.djunaidi@ums.ac.id, virnasdk@gmail.com, indah.pratiwi@ums.ac.id, hafidh.munawir@ums.ac.id",
298,Conflict Avoidance In Construction Stage Through Proper  Practice In Pre Contract Stage,"construction is a process which involves numerous parties having their own goals and objectives towards achieving a desired goal. thus, formation of conflicts amongst different parties are common in construction projects as each party is working for its own benefit. conflicts should be avoided at the first instance, as it may consume huge sum of money and time to resolve. therefore it is beneficial if the conflicts can be avoided at the pre contract stage which is the foremost stage of a construction project. hence the aim of this research is to develop a pre contract practice which would avoid conflicts at the construction stage. a preliminary interview was initially conducted amongst three industrial experts in construction field to identify the activities in the pre contract practice to eliminate the causes of conflicts. then a questionnaire survey was followed to identify the significant activities in pre contract practice. preliminary interview findings identified 105 activities which can be followed in pre contract practice to avoid conflicts. further, 97 activities were identified as significant in the questionnaire survey. thus, this paper solely address the causes of conflicts by suggesting activities in pre contract stage to eliminate the conflict in the construction industry.",conflict avoidance,"The construction industry is a place where conflicts are inevitable because multi-disciplinary parties are involved. Thus this study identified 50 causes which creates conflicts in the construction projects through a literature review. Accordingly 105 activities in the pre-construction stage which would eliminate the above identified causes were identified and carried forward to a questionnaire survey. Thus, 97 activities was identified as significant and refined pre contract practice was proposed through RIBA plan of work to avoid conflicts in construction stage.

299,Mathematical Modeling To Predict The Mechanical  Properties Of Hot Rolled Steel Sheets,"the prediction of the mechanical properties of hot rolled steel sheet is one of the most challenging tasks for the steel manufacturer. typically, the chemical composition of raw material for hot rolling process is not stable. therefore steel manufacturer has to predict the mechanical properties including yield strength (ys), tensile strength (ts) and elongation (el) based on input chemical composition. currently, the method for prediction is the simple linear regression (slr). the predictor in slr is only the carbon equivalent which is inadequate to accurately predict the mechanical properties. thus, this paper proposes the multiple linear regression (mlr) to determine more accurate regression equation. there are three important rolling process parameters considered in mlr including sheet thickness, finish temperature, and coiling temperature. it is found that mlr can yield better prediction value in terms of yield strength and elongation while slr is still the appropriate method for the prediction of tensile strength. based on the comparisons, both slr and mlr can enhance the accuracy in predicting the mechanical properties of hot rolled steel sheet.",for instant,"This paper aims to improve the control of hot rolling process. In order to achieve proper process control, the regression equation is needed to be appropriately modeled so that the quality characteristics in terms of yield strength, tensile strength, and elongation will be accurately predicted and controlled. The current prediction method of this steel manufacturer relies on only the carbon equivalent as Equation (1) and the simple liner regression is mainly used for predicting the mechanical properties. To improve the prediction of these mechanical properties, the multiple linear regression (MLR) model is employed to deal with the accuracy of prediction. The addition of factors which are hot rolling process parameters, thickness, and material composition successfully yields more appropriate prediction models for YS and EL. However, the SLR model is still the preferable method for prediction of the tensile strength. It can be concluded that the big data and the mathematical modeling techniques can significantly improve the prediction of the mechanical properties of hot rolled steel sheet in coil. In addition, these prediction equations can be utilized for process control so as to get the desired product characteristics. The recommended process parameters can be determined by solving these equations with optimization approach as well. The future research that should be done is the development on the accurate prediction equation by other modeling techniques.","chaovarat junpradub department of industrial engineering, faculty of engineering, king mongkut’s university of technology north bangkok. 1518, pracharat 1 road, wongsawang, bangsue, bangkok 10800, thailand. chaovaratj1973@gmail.com krisada asawarungsaengkul* operations research and engineering management research center, department of industrial engineering, faculty of engineering, king mongkut’s university of technology north bangkok. 1518, pracharat 1 road, wongsawang, bangsue, bangkok 10800, thailand krisada.a@eng.kmutnb.ac.th, krisadaa@kmutnb.ac.th",

302,The Impact Of Green Supply Chain Management Practices  On Operational Performance And Customer Satisfaction,"today, the business world is moving towards the “green concept” and most organizations focus on increasing performance in their operations while reducing the impact on environment. in manufacturing sector, adopting green concept in to managing supply chains is getting an increasing attention due to higher possibility of environmental impact during supply chain activities. the purpose of this study is to identify the direct impact of green supply chain management (gscm) practices on different dimensions of operational performance (flexibility, delivery, quality, & cost) and the indirect impact through these on customer satisfaction. data have been collected through a survey for which a total of 94 managers in manufacturing organizations responded. partial least square structural equation modeling (pls-sem) was applied to analyze the data and smartspls software was used. the study revealed that (gscm) practices lead to improve all dimensions of operational performance (flexibility, delivery, quality and cost) where only production flexibility and delivery significantly in turn improves customer satisfaction. any indirect impact of gscm practices on customer satisfaction through production cost and quality was not found in the study. this research has several important implications for manufacturers who have implemented and are willing to implement gscm practices in their firms. in addition, the study significantly contributes to the literature by providing empirical evidence for the impact of four dimensions of gscm practices (green purchasing, cooperation with customers, eco-design, and investment recovery) on operational performance and customer satisfaction.",,"There is no comprehensive investigation of the relationship of GSCM practices (green purchasing, cooperation with customers, eco-design and investment recovery) with operational performance (flexibility, delivery, quality and cost) and customer satisfaction. Therefore, this research study contributes to the literature providing empirical evidence for the impact of GSCM practices on operational performance and customer satisfaction. According to the results of the study, both of individual dimensions of GSCM practices and overall GSCM practices are significantly and positively linked with all the dimensions of operational performance. However, only the indirect impact through flexibility and delivery on customer satisfaction are indirectly associated with customer satisfaction while quality and cost have no significant mediating effect impact. 6. Theoretical and Managerial implications This research study provides empirical evidence for the impact of four dimensions of GSCM practices (green purchasing, cooperation with customers, eco-design and investment recovery) on four operational performance dimensions (flexibility, delivery, quality, and cost) and customer satisfaction. According to the respondents of the study, most of the manufacturing firms already have begun to implement GSCM practices such as considering suppliers‟ ISO 14000 certification; providing design specification to suppliers that include environmental requirement for purchased item; cooperating with customers for green packaging; cooperating with customers using less energy during product transportation; designing product for reuse, recycle, recovery of material/components parts; selling the scrap and used materials etc. Existing literature suggests that specific activities to support environmental collaboration, monitoring and control including monitoring reverse ﬂows of materials; sharing techniques and knowledge related to environmental management with supply chain partners; working to control the environmental risk associated with suppliers‟ operations; and working to assure proper product use (Vachon, S., 2007).These findings offer directions to manufacturers to enhance operational performance and customer satisfaction while implementing environmental practices throughout their supply chain. 7. Limitations and future research This study has a few limitations that might be overcome in future research in similar field. Data were collected only from manufacturing managers in Sri Lanka. If a future study increases the sample size and collect data from worldwide manufacturers, those findings will be valid to a broader context. In particular, the mediating role of quality and cost which found insignificant in this study can be reexamined. as a mediator. In addition, in depth studies that collect data from different managers within a selected manufacturing firm may explore a detailed information related to the relationships revealed in this study.","h. k. dilhani mallikarathna and c. w. chathurani silva department of decision sciences university of sri jayewardenepura gangodawila, nugegoda, sri lanka. mallikarathnadilhani@gmail.com, chathurani@sjp.ac.lk",

Technologies provide, through tools, the basis for these decisions to be made. The internet of things works with a great integrator of objects, capable of interacting, communicating and sharing various information. Big data is capable of storing a large amount of data and the simulation has attributes that facilitate beneficial choices for the organization. The integration of these technologies also bring diverse benefits to society, contributing to its development and efficiency. Today, the information base has a huge variety and amount of data. All of these factors contribute to an even greater share of technology. The formation of intelligent factories creates a collaborative network of machines capable of rapidly exchanging information autonomously. Is it possible that in the future machines alone make decisions? Analysis at this point is the starting point for a possible response. Technology, with its attributes, can become much more precise and assertive, but the human factor is necessary to perform information analysis and make the right decisions. These competences encompass aspects that mathematical and logical algorithms can not learn and reproduce, such as consciousness, empathy, and creativity. Of course more technologies will come. New skills and learning will be demanded.

309,Digital Human Modeling In Ergonomic Risk Assessment Of  Working Postures Using Rula,"digital human modeling (dhm), the process of cad representation of human body form, is an emerging tool used to simulate workplaces in order to provide solutions for ergonomics related problems. digital humans/manikins are being incorporated in the software, can be manipulated easily and assessed for work related discomfort, injuries and workplace design. manual workers in small scale industries are often exposed to work related discomfort and pain while performing work. these exposures may lead to development of work related musculoskeletal disorders (wrmsds) and low back pain (lbp), affecting the efficiency of workers and productivity of the industry. the main objective of current study is to analyze the working postures of manual workers in small scale industries by using rapid upper limb assessment (rula) assessment in catia v5r20 software. the workers in stone cutting and polishing industry were selected, and found to be working in awkward postures involving heavy manual lifting, bending, twisting and turning of the trunk. most of the postures indicated a high risk score of 7, indicating changes in the posture to be done immediately. ergonomic interventions were suggested and the improved posture was evaluated using rula and the posture indicated a score of 3, indicating low risk. the manual lifting task was also assessed using niosh lifting equation at the origin and destination of lift, using catia v5r20. the ergonomic interventions reduced the value of lifting index from 1.79 to 0.98, indicating safe limit. the results indicate that awkward working posture risks can be minimized by effectively using ergonomic interventions.","rula, posture","Digital Human Models and simulation have emerged as significant tools to facilitate proactive ergonomic investigations. The DHM technologies have allowed the ergonomist to early identification of ergonomic issues, and reduce or eliminate the need for physical and real human operator testing. Based on the results obtained from the studies conducted in the stone quarry and stone polishing industries, the working postures practiced by the workers while performing tasks are risky and unsafe. More workers are required to work in unsafe conditions handling heavy loads repetitively. The RULA method used to analyze the working postures indicated that about 57% postures in manual cutting, 50% postures in machine cutting and 46% postures in polishing units are in high category requiring further investigation and immediate change. Some of the postures were modeled in CATIA V5 to find out the risk levels, and the improvements were suggested based on CATIA results. In one case of lifting of heavy stone slabs in stone quarry, the RULA score is reduced to 3and 4 indicating medium risk, by incorporating engineering controls. Similarly in the polishing unit the RULA score for some postures is 7 in 2723","m. manzoor hussain department of mechanical engineering jawaharlal nehru technological university hyderabad – 500085, telangana state, india manzoorjntu@gmail.com qutubuddin s.m. industrial and production engineering department p.d.a.college of engineering gulbarga, karnataka state, india syedqutub16@gmail.com katuru phani raja kumar project manager, tech mahindra americas, usa. phani.katuru@gmail.com ch. kesava reddy mechanical engineering department, mgit, hyderabad, india chkrmech@gmail.com","References

310,A Knowledge Management Approach To Compare And  Develop The Asean University Credit Transfer System In,"this paper outlines a comparative study between the european credit transfer system (ects) and the asean credit transfer system (acts). in 2015, asean member countries will form the asean economic community (aec), a region promoting economic integration and the subsequent free flow of people, trade and culture. the aec will have significant impacts on higher education across the asean region, and this research investigates how knowledge management techniques can be utilized to respond effectively to the forthcoming acts. the acts is a tool created to enhance and facilitate credit transfer allocation between members of the asean university network (aun) and will present particular challenges for thailand’s university administration and management. the paper presents a case study from thailand, and leverages common knowledge acquisition and documentation structuring (commonkads) to capture appropriate knowledge from europe, where a successful europe-wide credit transfer system already exists. the paper undertakes a comparative study between the ects and the proposed acts. the case study is based within the faculties of law, at chiang mai university (cmu), thailand, and university lumière lyon 2, france. in thailand, a requirement exists to prepare and provide a new framework to ensure its credit transfer system (cts) procedure correlates with the needs of the asean university network cts (aun- cts). the aun-cts is a particular aspect of the aun, which members must adhere to. this research therefore studies the importance and usefulness of the ects in comparison to the acts and more importantly, captures existing and relevant knowledge from the ects to raise awareness and enhance the credit transfer procedure of the cmu law faculty. results show that utilizing knowledge to create a successful credit transfer allocation will facilitate increased student and faculty exchange, including training programs and worker mobility.","law, commonkads, credit transfer","In this study, the 2 groups of expert interview from CMU and University Lumiere’ Lyon 2 were performed with the ECTS model was examined. A CommonKADS technique is applied to capture appropriate knowledge from Europe. The case study is based within the Faculties of Law, at Chiang Mai University, Thailand, and University Lumiere Lyon2, France. This research therefore studies the importance and usefulness of the ECTS in comparison to the ACTS. As of 2016, there is no AUN credit transfer system in CMU and ASEAN University Network. In this research, a model of ASEAN University Network Credit Transfer System was created. It provides a process for student and faculty academic exchange through the University Notification Rules and Regulations. There are 3 types of ACTS- CMU credit transfer: Type I Direct Credit Transfer, Type II Transformation Credit Transfer and Type III Auditing. The AUN-CTS is a particular aspect of the AUN, which members must adhere to. Results show that utilizing knowledge to create a successful credit transfer allocation will facilitate increased student and faculty exchange, including training programs and worker mobility.","thailand chayamarnie bhiriyawanit faculty of law, chiang mai university, maung, chiang mai, 50200, thailand. chayamarnie@yahoo.com abdelaziz bouras university lumiere lyon2, france. abdelaziz.bouras@univ-lyon2.fr",
311,Industry 4.0 Gap Analysis For Thai Industries With  Association Rules Mining,"industry 4.0 is an emerging term that has drawn great attention the past few years. it consists of variety of technologies including internet of things, cloud computing, sensor, mobile devices, big data. the goal of industry 4.0 is to incorporate these technologies to create the factories that are highly efficient and highly adaptive to meet organizational goals. the adoption of this concepts has been reported worldwide in various name such as “industrial internet of things” in the us or “the made in china 2025 initiative” in china. however, there is no publication of the current situation of the adoption in thailand. this paper presents a survey of current adoption of the concept of industry 4.0 in thai industries in the attempt to identify the gap between the current situation and the ideal situation that the industries want to position themselves. the survey was conducted using questionnaires with 50 factories located throughout thailand and across many sectors. the results were analyzed using association rule mining techniques. it was founded that industry 4.0 technologies that has highest percentage of implementation at presents are mobile devices and sensor technologies but still there are gaps of need for both technologies. the technology that has not yet implemented but has highest need is big data technology. the overall results suggested that, at the moment, it was not found the evident that thai industries have explicit plan to transform their organization with respect to industry 4.0 concept.","association rules, data mining","column is the “then” part. Support is the probability that both premises and conclusion are found together in the database. Confidence measures how often the rule has been found to be true. For example, rule number 3 (RD external ⇒ Production external) showed support of 0.54 and confidence of 0.871; this means that in 54% of company who select both sharing R&D data externally and sharing production data externally, and 87.1% of companies that select sharing R&D data externally also select sharing production data externally. Table 3: Association rules from model 3. Table 3 shows highly correlation among data sharing externally. For example, R&D and production data are related together (rule 3, and rule 7), purchasing data are correlated with production data (rule 8) and service data are correlated with R&D data (rule 3). 6. Conclusion This paper presents the analysis of survey result from the questionnaire of 50 Thai large scale companies regarding to the adoption of industry 4.0 concept. The results suggested that most Thai companies are operating at less than ideal status. Biggest gaps in terms of technologies are founded to be Big data, M2M and sensor technology. Currently, less than half of the companies surveyed applied some of the industry 4.0 concept in their operational function especially sales, logistics and purchasing. However, ideally they would like to increase their adoption in all the fuctions. The functions that shows the biggest gap are IT, production, and R&D. The results from association rules mining reveal that for Thai industry, in strategy level, technologies that Thai companies already have are mobile devices and sensor. These technologies have direct links to their need, for example. the company who has mobile device technology also express need for that technology. Most Thai industry does not have big data technology yet but there is a strong link of those who already need and have sensor technology to the need of big data in the future. Big data can be identified as a gap for Thai Industry that need to be fulfilled. For the adoption level, For Thai companies regarding the concept of smart factory, the technologies already implemented are M2M and interoperability. M2M communication has link to sensor, mobile device and big data. The link between M2M and sensor is obvious since sensor is one of the most important parts in order for M2M to work. Mobile device helps to access M2M data anywhere and big data helps to analyze M2M data. For the concept of smart operation, the results suggested that for Thai and EU data are stored and used externally and they are highly co-related. There is no link to technology need on the Thai side but there are link from current 2744","wimalin laosiritaworn and wichai chattinnawat department of industrial engineering chiang mai university chiang mai, 50200, thailand wimalin@hotmail.com, chattinw@eng.cmu.ac.th","References

319,Factors Investigation For The Development Of Medical Device  Towards Sustainable Product,"today healthcare service has offered the modern treatment approach with medical technology. this kind of technology has become such a predominant part of healthcare service because no practical diagnosis or treatment strategy is possible without using them. the advancement of technology is also driving medical companies with great opportunities to take a new innovative product into market. in addition, company could not focus solely on large amount of volume and low production cost to keep up growth, however, they have to control its direction towards quality trusted for usage. meanwhile, climate change and pollution is increasingly unprecedented before and putting burdensome on this sector, which is lacking behind other sectors, to become sustainable manufacturing organization. that is true that medical device industry considers safety, usability and efficacy of product, but product design and development is a major role behind these factors. sustainable design, sometimes called green design, has become a globally significance topic but not many works of academic papers are directly targeted to the medical device product. therefore, the purpose of this study is initially conducted to identify influencing factors and then determine key improvement recommendation for sustainable development of medical device. analytic hierarchy process (ahp) is used to prioritize the influencing factors and quality function deployment (qfd) is used to find the key improvement attributes recommendation. the result of this study shows linear relationship between product user and developer towards quality and sustainability of product. it is found that the most of the top concerns of device users are not only safe for present use but also recyclability, which product can be made for environmental conservation, at the end of its life.","medical device, sustainability, ahp","Business could be created not just only operate what company wants to do but also has to listen and observe both inside and outside environment. Product design and development play a central role for business manufacturing company. However, to get all collectively right information among stakeholder requirement and putting in the process is the sparkle of success. The product user and developer are two sides of the same coin which could not be separated away that this relationship is a bridge to keep business innovation alive. AHP and QFD are the powerful tools for user-centered design which can work best together with cross-functional teams; however, they require qualified set of experts who are specialized in solving problem. The result of this study shows sustainable perception in healthcare industry that they tend to take responsibility for using product which reduce side effect of environment and conserve natural resource utilization. On one plus side, the attributes improvement recommendations are the key pathway to reach sustainable product development goal, which material selection is a high priority among names ranged. Future research will be conducted to develop robust sustainable product design and development framework for medical device with case study, yet make interview with whom responses for product procurement and user. This research helps turn the light for researchers or the ones who are new in field of healthcare product to take their attention and boost their confidence to do further research by taking concept of sustainability.","taisy mak department of industrial engineering mahidol university salaya, nakhon pathom, 73170, thailand taisymak@yahoo.com, duangpun kritchanchai department of industrial engineering mahidol university salaya, nakhon pathom, 73170, thailand duangpun.skr@mahidol.ac.th",

322,Engineering Education And Self Dependence: A Nigerian  Experience,"the emphasis on producing graduates with entrepreneurship abilities have heightened in recent times in nigeria due to the persistent decline in public and private job opportunities. this has mounted unprecedented pressure on the engineers who were previously thought to be drivers of job creation and technological transformation. rather than confronting the unhealthy job scarcity appreciably, engineering graduates have surprisingly ranked high in the profile of job seekers, to the extent of scampering for lean banking and allied jobs, sales and security agents etc. an attempt is made in this paper to review engineering education with a view to ascertain the root cause of graduating massive job seeking engineers from nigerian institutions, short of job creators or entrepreneurs, at least. the making of a nigerian engineer is presented in terms of education and training, including the qualification for admission and the eventual admission criteria set by government and institutions. the effects of the prevailing factors surrounding engineering education are delineated with specific merits and shortfalls. opportunities for improvement and areas needing reforms were suggested. the policy results of the research, if properly implemented, can reposition engineering graduates and engineering educators for accelerated job creation in the country as well as embolden the self-dependence prospects of engineers.","job creation, entrepreneurship","The performance of Nigerian engineering graduates is largely dependent not on the end, but is much of a path process. The time to wake up and embrace the deafening challenges to engineering graduates in Nigeria cannot be postponed any further. There is no generation of homo-sapiens with a monopoly of intelligence. The difference is mostly on the environmental conditions surrounding the nurture of individuals. Towards this, the environment and training path of engineers in Nigeria can be re-engineered to provide for graduation of quality world class engineers that will transform the country technologically and economically. Qualitative mastery of the tenets of engineering by lecturers and students will aid ample job creation and self-employment, as well as inadvertently effect the actualization of the change mantra of the federal government. 2838","paul a. ozor1,2 and charles mbohwa1 1department of quality and operations management, university of johannesburg, south africa 2department of mechanical engineering-industrial engineering and management, university of nigeria nsukka, nigeria pozor@uj.ac.za, cmbohwa@uj.ac.za","References

325,Supply Chain Management Of Facility Operations And  Maintenance Function In Apparel Sector,"a facility cannot be smoothly operated if not properly maintained. hence, facility operations and maintenance (o&m) function has obtained a noteworthy recognition due to its significant contribution made for the continuous operation of a facility, core-business performance and occupant’s satisfaction. however, the diverse nature of facility o&m functions necessitates effective supply chains. in particular, the crucial elements engaged in o&m functions such as the parties involved, information flows, finance flows and service/product flows have been neglected in previous studies. hence, this study aims to develop a model for supply chain management of facility o&m function in apparel sector. given the importance of apparel manufacturing to sri lankan national economy, the study was focused on apparel factories. an in-depth literature review followed by case study design under qualitative approach was deployed for empirical investigation. the collected data was analysed using manual content analysis and using qsr n-vivo software. according to the case study findings, supply chain management in o&m functions is carried out in ad-hoc manner in case study orgnisations. the study developed a scm process for facility o&m functions incorporating three o&m sub processes; i.e. (a) customer relationship management, (b) internal supply chain management, and (c) supplier relationship management. the research findings can be used as a guide by the facility o&m teams for optimising the performance of o&m supply chain functions.",supply chain,"and Recommendations Facilities operation and maintenance is something unavoidable in current context and especially in apparel manufacturing facilities. Starting from the external fabric up to utility services determine the quality of work environment and ensures the continuous production process within the facility. For instance a breakdown in compressor would hold the entire sewing process and would impact the targeted output. Hence, O&M is paramount for apparel factories. Yet, no factories focus on streamlining its supply chain and determining a practicable O&M supply chain process. As a result, synergies, which could be gained in the process is neglected. This could be overcome by initially determining the O&M supply chain and establishing the supply chain process. This study had made an effort in determining both, which would contribute to industrial practitioners in long run. The O&M maintenance supply chain is a chain of networks, which is made of internal customers, external customers, internal suppliers and external suppliers along with interrelated information flows, finance flows and service/product flows. Further, the O&M supply chain involves direct and indirect relationships among multiple parties creating several challenges such as improper coordination, not meeting customer requirements, long waiting time, lack of spare parts, and more. In order to address such challenges incorporating SCM process is necessary. The developed O&M-SCM process mainly comprises three sub process as CRM, ISCM and SRM. In order to ensure the implementation of such sub processes several strategies were introduced through the study. The developed O&M supply chain and the O&M-SCM process could be utilized by facilities managers, maintenance engineers and other professional engaged in similar disciplines to ensure a seamless service delivery to meet end customer requirement and in long term add on to organisational profit. This study had made an effort in determining both, which would contribute to industrial practitioners in long run. The study will be further developed to establish a performance measurement system to enhance effectiveness and efficiency of FM supply chain.

326,A Conceptual Framework To Optimise The Impact Of  Embodied Energy And Operational Energy In Buildings,"since the global energy consumption is reaching unsustainable levels, the need for regulating energy consumptions has been highlighted. as revealed from literature, buildings consume approximately 50% of the global energy annually, during construction, operation, maintenance and deconstruction stages. hence a variety of methods are followed to minimise the impacts of embodied energy (ee) and operational energy (oe) in buildings. ee impacts of buildings are becoming significant with the increased efficiency in oe consumption. therefore, considering either ee or oe in its individuality is not a pragmatic approach. the design stage was identified as the most suitable stage for integrating energy efficiency measures, since most crucial project decisions are taken at this stage. different professionals who can impact energy decisions were also identified. although a multitude of research has been conducted on ee and oe individually, there seems a lack of investigations that focus on both these aspects together. therefore, this paper sets out to develop a conceptual framework to optimise the impact of ee and oe in buildings during the design stage by reviewing secondary data. the involvement of construction professionals, barriers and strategies to optimise the impact of ee and oe are discussed and incorporated to the framework.","design stage, embodied energy","and Way Forward The limited number of research that focuses on both EE and OE reduction in parallel, bears testimony to the fact that achieving simultaneous EE and OE reductions is a difficult endeavour. This paper looks at theoretical aspects and sets the foundation for a larger subsequent empirical investigation on determining strategies for achieving simultaneous EE and OE reductions during the building design stage. As the next step of the study, the conceptual framework, can be used to develop best practice guidelines to achieve simultaneous EE and OE reduction in buildings during the design stage.","during the design stage tennakoon g.a, waidyasekara k g.a.s and ekanayake b.j department of building economics university of moratuwa 10400, moratuwa, sri lanka gihananuradha1994@gmail.com, anuradha@uom.lk, ra-biyanka@uom.lk",
327,The Impact Of Customized Service And Guest Satisfaction In  The Tourism And Hospitality Industry,"the tourism and hospitality industry is a rapidly growing, fast paced and dynamic industry. the tourism and hospitality industry had a major transformation around the nineteen-sixties, when hotels were no longer exclusively found in city centres, but saw the development of new locations. this fueled the expansion of the industry. around the nineteen- eighties, the industry evolved a strategy centred on the pampering of the guest. the industry’s growth has been rapid and fast paced. this growth is continuing today, and, the more the industry grows and advances, the more complex their customers/guests become. service excellence in the tourism and hospitality industry has, therefore, advanced tremendously since a decade ago, and guests have also transformed and became more sophisticated. they demand customized service; they expect service excellence at all times; and they complain much more often than ever before about every possible aspect of their experience. because of the demand from guests, the industry spends much time training staff on service excellence, motivating staff to prioritize guest experience, and putting measures in place to make sure that the rules are adhered to and guests are happy with the service they receive. the trends in the current experience of hotels includes, for example, staffing kitchens with master chefs to stylize the guests’ dining experience at all mealtimes. therefore, experience has become a key motivator in how service is being customized for the guest. key words: hospitality industry, service excellence, customer orientated service. 2884",,"Companies in the tourism and hospitality industry have become customer oriented to meet the demands and expectations of their beloved customers. According to Angelo and Vladimir (2011:18) the companies in the hospitality industry have an obligation to deliver on the promise they make to customers, owners and its employees. There have been many theories and ideas about service delivery to guests but implementation of these theories remains a challenge. Guests today are demanding and difficult and expect value for the money they pay. Angelo and Vladimir (2011:16) further mentions that successful hospitality companies focus a great deal of management attention on establishing quality standards for services, communicating these standards to their employees through training programs and measure performance and guests feedback. Guests of the 21st century have evident or significant difference to the guests from a decade ago when the industry started. The difference in these guests is clear and visible by their requirements, behaviors, expectations and overall likes and dislikes and hoteliers are to take heed and educate themselves on such matters so to please and keep their guests and in the long run maintain them on their side and not captured and swept away by their ever trying competitor. 6.","dr e i edoun faculty of engineering and the built environment department of quality and operations management university of johannesburg auckland park, south africa eiedoun@uj.ac.za professor c mbohwa faculty of engineering and the built environment department of quality and operations management university of johannesburg auckland park, south africa cmbohwa@uj.ac.za mrs thobile yvonne bhila faculty of engineering and the built environment department of quality and operations management university of johannesburg auckland park, south africa bdc.thobile@gmail.com customer orientation, operations management, hospitality operations and service excellence",
328,The Effectiveness Of Total Quality Management  And Operations Performance At A Bakery Firm In,"in recent times, the south african bakery industry has gone under intense competition that threatens the survival of players within the sector. an identified bakery firm located in the city of tshwane is not immune to the problem. faced with fierce competition from established bakery firms such as albany, sasko, supreme, blue ribbon and retail own brands such as shoprite, spar and pick n pay, the bakery firm urgently need to rethink its strategy to secure its survival. an assessment of total quality management (tqm) on the operations of the bakery firm is a recommended strategy for continuous improvement and gaining a competitive edge. it is therefore important in this study to understand employees’ perceptions of total quality management and establish its impact on operational performance. for the sake of bringing this study into operation, the researcher utilised a descriptive research design. data was collected through a well-structured questionnaire from a sample of 110 employees working for the bakery firm. analyses of data that include mean values, standard deviation, correlation and regression analyses was performed through the use of the statistical package for social sciences. results showed that employees had a negative perception on total quality management factors that include leadership, knowledge management, supplier management, customer focus, employee involvement and process management. a significant positive relationship was also found between total quality management (leadership, knowledge management, supplier management, customer focus, employee involvement and process management) and operational performance. this study also provides recommendations to authorities within the bakery industry so as to improve total quality management and operational performances key words: african bakery industry, total quality management, operations performance, city of tshwane, leadership, support management, knowledge management © ieom society international 2896",,,"the city of tshwane, pretoria south africa syria sibongile chauke sibongile.chauke@labour.gov.za ei edoun edounsen@hotmail.com charles mbohwa cmbohwa@uj.ac.za quality and operations management university of johannesburg",
329,The Essence Of   Communication And Its Operationalisation  On Managerial Effectiveness,,,"and Recommendations During the study it was established that certain areas provide opportunities for further research: Due to the important role external stakeholders’ play in determining service delivery successes in organisations and related companies, it is proposed that a study be undertaken on eMIS system, to understand the benefits and dis-benefits that the system has for the organisations and for the community they are servicing. It is recommended that a study be undertaken to investigate policies on employee motivation with an aim to improve performance and productivity. The language used in existing policies to be reviewed as well, to ensure common understanding by all. Conclusion The study found that, there are several barriers to communication in organisations and related companies. This paper revealed that employees of the same level share similar challenges however on the other hand challenges on each level differ. Employees are also not fully aware of what the other levels are experiencing due to different working environments they are exposed to. Therefore, Stakeholders (internal and external) play a significant role to determine if communication is effective or not. Also, it was noticed that, there are always challenges in organisations but employees are not aware that their challenges are results of gaps in communication. 3.",,

332,Development Of The P I N T A R Concept For Designing  Core Competencies Using The Malcolm Baldrige,"the competitiveness of industry needs a quality of their human resources. people aspect in organization always treats as an object which should follow the rules that has made. in another fact, peoples or employee are the object that should need waiting for the treatment. the most important thing in service industry is human capital. therefore, to achieve with more efficient and effectively, organization needs the competence person to do any kind of function. by competency profiling, all of factors comes from board of management should be clear and can be translated as a business driver and corporate values. in terms of creating basic direction for human capital development, the company tries to change all attributes in static to be a competency attribute to catch up the competitiveness. by create in internal initiative and describe all of the core competences aspects, it has driven the corporate to develop of competency profiling. this modeling based on their design in a concept from the ethos of work, it mentioned as p i n t a r concept, and described into their mapping of core competencies by using the theory of excellent performance of malcolm balridge. this mapping process has been made as a concrete policy which should be implemented in field. so the goal for management is to focus attention on competencies that really affect competitive advantage. this paper used the methodology with description analysis to ensure the approach process can be related to the basic concept and elaborated to the theory based. it had designed for the company which has services as a third party logistics. currently, the concept has embedded as part of company culture and philosophy to encourage their employee.","competitiveness, human resources, core competence","In general, the results of the analysis and processing of data obtained provide interrelated relationships with each other both from the initial preparation of the vision and eg the company, mapping core competencies, identifying individual competencies and the performance to be achieved by the company. Some conclusions that can be given are: 1. That the level of competition in the increasingly tight logistics industry causes every company to be able to develop adaptive and competent human resource capabilities based on the company's understanding and competitive advantage. 2. Core competency identification provides direction for individual development in order to balance the company's pace in business competition based on its goals and vision and mission. 3. That a strong foundation is needed in translating core competencies through an implementation mechanism that is easily absorbed and carried out as a life view and work orientation basis. Uniqueness and specificity in outlining core competencies will create creativity and excellence for companies in addressing industrial competition. 4. Thus, identifying the core competencies of the company is creating a basic framework for individual development that is based on individual internal conditions such as understanding the business knowledge carried out, skills in planning strategies and orientation to customers. These innovative motives will make it easy for individuals to develop and be moved to constantly improve their business performance. 6.","performance excellence approach the description analysis at third party logistics company sri witjaksono widiadibrata doctoral management program mercu buana university jakarta, indonesia maswi85@yahoo.com prof. dr. sundring pantja djati, m.si, ma chairman of postgraduate program doctoral management university mercubuana jakarta, indonesia",
333,Classification Of Bearing Fault Location And Severity Using  Cascade Anns With Statistical And Spectral Features,"advance in machine learning techniques for machine condition monitoring is now an active field of interest in modern industry for predicting the future health of machines. in this paper, artificial neural networks (anns) technique is investigated by using the existing datasets of ball bearing fault to classify the fault location and severity. to enhance the accuracy, the utilization of statistical features and spectral features are used in pre-processing with the proposed method of cascade anns. motor vibration data is collected by using accelerometers attached to the housing in the drive end and fan end. to diagnose the faults in the rolling bearing, the vibration data is pre- processing by using fast fourier transform (fft) and other statistical features such as standard deviation, skewness and kurtosis etc. then the feature data is fed into cascade ann_1 and ann_2 to classify the fault location and severity. the objective of this research is to solve the problem of poor features such as slippage frequency component in fft response and inappropriate statistical feature datasets to help increase in accuracy and efficiency. the results show that the proposed method gives more accuracy when the poor features are existed and guarantee the accuracy near to 100%.","machine learning, ball bearing, vibration data","The proposed cascade neural networks for bearing faults detection and diagnosis can be used to classify the location and severity of faults effectively. The use of statistical features such as mean, standard deviation, root mean square, skewness and kurtosis to the FFT signal cannot give a good result in both location and severity classification because the FFT amplitudes are almost equal around normalized frequency at 0.5. The proposed cascade ANNs method has its contribution in the case where the systems have poor features and these features cannot be recognized effectively in the next classification process (ANN_1). In such case, we use the cascade neural network 2 (ANN_2) to help dominate with the good features. Especially, in the case where we do not know when the poor features exist. This proposed method guarantees the solution output of the neural networks to be accurate near 100%. In addition, it is a simplified method for general machine fault detection and diagnosis. 6. Future Works In future works of this research, we may play attention to the optimization algorithms of learning process, new statistical features or new feature extraction process such as parallel neural networks, convolution neural networks, etc. Furthermore, we may use sound signal (acoustic emission) in the future research instead of vibration signal as it is rarely studied in this fields.

334,Forecasting At Completion: Introduction Of New Method  And Comparing It With The Method Of Earned Schedule.,"it is more than a decade that evm as one of the most essential principles of the science of project management, has given up its place to the newfangled method of ""earned schedule"", because of its deficiencies in showing the behaviour of projects. a method which in comparison with the previous methods, has the needed capability to concentrate on the topic ""time"" without analysing the actual cost and solved the problems of the schedule performance index. however, the continual use of the method earned schedule showed that although its indexes in use have been efficient in the condition of projects, in spite of the basic expectation, the issue of forecasting the future is still one of the obsessions of the stakeholders. in this article, based on the identifying the defects of es method in forecasting the future of the project, a new method named as "" forecasting at completion"" has been introduced which is being shown as fc. this method has introduced new parameters to managers and the results of using it show that it is more practical than the previous methods. key words project management- s-curve- forecasting at completion- evm- es- spi (t) - spi - regression analysis 1. introduction since at the time of delays, the stakeholders criticize the project managers as soon as possible, these people try to consider the five-pieces process of standard pmbok in initiating process and planning process the project and use them as tools which can decrease the probability of crisis occurrence in project the most. it cannot be denied though that the nonexistence of stability in global economy conditions has increased the effect of external factors on projects and consequently has made experiencing such situations inevitable. therefore in the recent years the importance of reports of performance has been depleted and the reports that forecast the future conditions will be noticed twice as important. maybe the innovation of the earned schedule and expanding its use can be considered as the result of needing such reports. notwithstanding, the consequence of using this method in various projects and comparing it with gathered documents at the end of the project, has changed our attitude toward the quality of the achieved 3769",,"In this project, after analyzing ""Earned Value"" method, we have concluded that although this method has shown a much better performance than ""Earned Value Management"" in estimating the project duration, analyzing the completed projects proved that the total dependency of this method on schedule performance index, and its ignoring the performance that actual progress curve has shown from the beginning till the reporting time, has made a distance between the forecasts and realities. In this project after confirming the analysis performance of ES method against EVM, we recognized and solved its deficiencies. Ultimately, we introduced a new method with the title of FC which could enable the managers in presenting more appropriate forecasts for future. Implementing this method in three projects with different conditions in performance of actual progress, displayed that the new index (IEAC(R)) gives better results in comparison with (IEAC (t)). Therefore aside with the deficiency of the mentioned index, it is suggested that in order to forecast the future conditions of the projects, FC method replaces ES method. 8.","ali maaleki m.sc social & economical engineering no 501,enterance 3,block 3,baharan complex, av.bayat, shahr-e-rey,tehran 9192240632. 0098 ali.maleki66@live.com kaveh mohammad cyrus asistant professor amirkabir university amirkabir university, tehran ,iran 64545360, 021. 0098 cyrusk@aut.ac.ir davoud gholamiangonabadi department of industrial engineering and management systems amirkabir university of technology (tehran polytechnic) tehran, iran dgholamian@gmail.com",
335,Feature Selection And Machine Learning Classification For  Live P2P Traffic,"classification of bandwidth-heavy internet traffic is important for network administrators to throttle network of heavy bandwidth traffic applications. statistical methods have been previously proposed as promising method to identify internet traffic based on their statistical features. the selection of statistical features still plays an important role in accurate and timely classification although most feature selection algorithms consider the correlation between features. in this work, we propose a technique based on features characters and principal components analysis (pca) feature selection algorithms for online peer-to-peer (p2p) traffic detection. using naïve bayes and j48 machine learning techniques for available traces from university of brescia and university of cambridge, experimental results show that the proposed method is able to achieve up to 99.5% accuracy for 0.007 second testing time. these results are superior to other existing approaches in term of accuracy and testing time.","online features, p2p, features selection, machine learning","Classification of bandwidth heavy Internet traffic is important for network administrators to throttle the network from heavy bandwidth traffic applications.

336,Identification Of Opinion Leadership: A Literature Review  L.M.B.N. Kolugala And H.S. Jayasena,"the concept of diffusion of innovation outlines the transmission of innovatory solutions in different fields and among its key components social systems and communication channels act in the effective dissemination of novice solutions. thus, opinion leaders are required to be identified within a social system where interconnectivity among the actors imply the nature of the social network for effective dissemination of innovative solutions. under this context, it is essential to understand the opinion leadership, their relationship with adopter categories in relation of diffusion of innovation, communication channels, threshold of adoption and the methods by which an opinion leader could be identified in a social system. a comprehensive literature review is conducted to review and analyze opinion leadership and its attributes in relation to effective dissemination of innovative solutions. the research findings elaborate on the characteristics of opinion leadership and their identification methods and the involvement of organizational opinion leaders in innovation diffusion. the findings of this review would be beneficial for those researchers who are attentive in identifying opinion leaders and their influence in social networks and related fields.",opinion leader,"Within the concept Diffusion of Innovation process, the position of Opinion Leader is identified who also identified as an early adopter. Subsequently, Opinion Leader’S characteristics, position on adopter categories and the modes of identifying them highlighted the usability of the Opinion Leaders as effective personnel in the dissemination of innovation. Their behaviour of an opinion Leader in a social system is prominent indicating that their recognition leading towards the adherence of innovative solutions to the whole system. Thus, it could be concluded that their conduct portrays on the higher social interactions through informal communication procedures with the required competency level to lead others on novice practices.

338,Human Error Assessment In The Accident Causations  Experienced Among Vehicle Drivers In The Philippines,"according to statistics, thousands of people are killed and injured on roads. the philippines is ranked 116th in the world out of 183 countries for having the highest death rate caused by road traffic accidents. this kind of issue has to be discussed for this involves the lives of people. the researchers have conducted their preliminary study by researching through existing studies that discuss the reasons for the problems to occur. the researchers have identified the main cause of the problem to occur among drivers through literature reviews which also happens to be the possible primary cause of road accidents in metro manila is driver recognition error, which includes driver inattention, internal and external distractions, and inadequate surveillance. but to further identify the main causes or factors for these problems to occur, the researchers conducted a survey through the distribution of questionnaires. the respondents of the survey are licensed drivers in metro manila. at the end of the study, the researchers have used several tools to identify the factors that are significant for the problems to occur. anxiety, motivation, and sleep were the factors that affect attention level among drivers. the researchers have recommended designing a predictive model which will help prevent or reduce road accidents in metro manila. with that in mind, together with the results of the study, the researchers are compelled to make recommendations in order to improve driving situations here in metro manila.","attention, road accidents, driver error","Based on the statistical tests applied by the researchers, the sample data is normal, having a p-value of 0.399, which is greater than the alpha level of 0.05. The multiple regression analysis results show that anxiety (p-value = 0.035), motivation (p-value = 0.000), and sleep (p-value = 0.000) are the factors that are statistically significant to driver attention. Moreover, the low r-squared value obtained does not indicate that the model produced by the multiple regression analysis is not a good fit for the data. It is normal for fields that study and aim to predict human behavior to obtain r-squared values less than 50% because of the differences between personalities in individuals. This study led the researchers to conclude that the assessment of the factors significant to driver attention could be the starting point in improving driver stimuli recognition in order to reduce the risk of road accidents in the Philippines. Assessment of the different factors found to be statistically significant to driver attention is important because driving skill is not the sole predicting factor in identifying which drivers have a high probability of being involved in road accidents. In the Philippines where driving conditions are frustrating, to say the least, consideration of the factors included in this study contributes to ensuring safety in Philippine roads. 6. Recommendations The following significant factors (1) sleep - attention, (2) motivation – attention, and (3) anxiety – attention needs to be addressed in order to increase the attention level and the driving performance. Moreover, the researchers are recommending the following: Table 6. Summary of Recommendations PRESENT PROPOSED PROBLEM/S ADDRESS Driving at any period of the day. If at all possible, avoid driving between midnight and 6 AM. The driver will now respect the natural circadian rhythm of the human body that affects driving performance. The average sleep of the respondents is 6 hours and 30 minutes. • Get seven to eight (7-8) hours of sleep as much as possible before driving. • Create a sleeping habit including time of sleep, wake up time, and sleep duration • Driver’s lack of sleep. • Circadian rhythm of the driver 47% of the respondents are considered anxious moderately and 11% of them are anxious severely. • Meditate before driving to reduce psychological stress (anxiety, positive mood, mental health- related quality of life, attention) • Exercise at least 30 minutes a day The driver will now improve their attention by reducing anxiety. 2989","gann sebastian b. quiban, bryan d. caventa, patricia paula h. corpuz, francesco nicolai l. datu, rica jonell a. millet, yoshiki b. kurata* department of industrial engineering technological institute of the philippines, quezon city, philippines gannster9@gmail.com, bryancaventa2519@gmail.com, patriciapaula0716@yahoo.com, datunicolai@gmail.com, ricamillet@yahoo.com, yoshiki_kurata@yahoo.com","References

340,Influence Factors For Intention To Using Facebook To  Mitigate Obesity Among Sudanese Women,": social media (sm) has rapidly evolved over the years to become a dominant platform used globally by millions of users for a variety of applications. in contrast, health problems, in particular, obesity have worsened over recent years. the literature review undertaken in this study has revealed that obesity remains one of the significant health issues globally. also, despite the widespread use of sm among the population in developing countries, such as sudan, the use of technology interventions to mitigate adverse health habits remains in its infancy. likewise, there are limited theoretical models which lead towards the intention to use sm such as facebook to address these sorts of problems. therefore, this study proposes a model for the intention to use facebook as the most popular platform in sudan to mitigate the problem of obesity with particular emphasis on investigating the important factors that lead to the intention to use facebook for dieting among middle-aged sudanese women. in this study, a framework model was developed by hybridising the theory of planned behaviour (tpb) and the health beliefs model (hbm) which included factors that could predict preventive health behaviours from the hbm, namely; perceived susceptibility, perceived seriousness, and perceived threat. this also included the factors related to the tpb such as attitude, perceived behavioural control and subjective norms. this research study is a progress paper that contributes to the body of knowledge in this domain, in particular, obesity. while the framework model has not been tested, it is proposed that future research is undertaken to empirically investigate the proposed model by using smart pls3 for further analysis.","obesity, diet, facebook",,"ghada ahmad abdelguiom information system dept., school of computing, utm ghada.sudan@gmail.com noorminsh a.lahad information system dept., school of computing, utm minshah@utm.my",
341,Smes Managing Organisational Knowledge In The 4Ir Era:  A Case Study Of Developing Countries,"at the current moment, the whole world is talking about the implementation of the fourth industrial revolution and the impact it will have on everyone including businesses, the government, academic fraternity and the general population at large. academics and businesses are working on finding a road map for implementing this new phenomenon. however, it is of paramount importance to understand that organizational knowledge needs to remain in the organisation. therefore, the question is how can smes manage the organizational knowledge in the 4th industrial era? this question is posed because many things will change because of the 4ir. this is a qualitative approach where numerous articles were reviewed and a framework was proposed. it was discovered that despite a number of challenges that smes are encountering in developing countries such as lack of finance, lack of skilled employees and key employees leaving the organisation, they will have to be participants in the 4ir era. this study is original because there is limited research in the adoption of the 4ir in smes and managing knowledge during the 4ir era. further research must be done on the technological techniques that can be used by smes to managing knowledge.","keywords: 4ir, smes","Knowledge sharing is crucial because it helps improve the innovativeness, competitiveness and profitability of the entity. SMEs play a pivotal role in the growth of the economy of the country. However, they encounter numerous challenges that need to be addressed urgently so that the above mentioned SMEs can be able to reach their maximum potential. Moreover, as we are in the infancy phase of the fourth industrial revolution that is driven by Big Data and Artificial Intelligence. As these latest advanced technologies will change the way things are done, SMEs must also find a way to manage organisational knowledge in the fourth industrial revolution. Barriers for sharing organisational knowledge are explored in this study. It is alluded in this research that in order for organisational knowledge sharing to take place there must be trust between employees, employees must be motivated to share their knowledge, management must also support its employees with regards to sharing organisational knowledge, employees must work with each other, information technology must also be available. All the above will contribute in ensuring that knowledge is shared successfully in the organisation in the fourth industrial era. This study is limited to SMEs in developing nations (South Africa, Malaysia and India).

342,"Design Intervention In Maheshwar Handloom, Mp, India  Pratik Mukesh","textile industry plays important role in our country's economy. handloom weaving sector is one of the most important sectors, have the potential to produce employment. however, this sector is ignored in terms of development. due to lack of development in this field, the workers were forced to use traditional methods and equipment for their task, which was time consuming and hard work. workers suffered a lot of health problems due to the practice of traditional techniques of weaving. this leads to loss of interest by workers in this field and their migration to other areas of work. it also seriously affects the socio-economic conditions of rural people. besides, directly or indirectly it does affect the economy. it is also very time-consuming task. so, an ergonomic and technical improvement was important for upgrading traditional weaving. this work identified the issues with traditional weaving process of maheshwar handloom sector and propose solution provide a better working condition to the workers involved in the maheshwar handloom weaving sector. further, the work also focuses to provide a viable and feasible solution to reduce ergonomic risk factors and satisfy workers of maheshwar handloom weaving sector by earn profit and also increase productivity and provide efficient work.","design, ergonomics, textile, handloom","This study showed that Maheshwar Handcraft sector needed lots of ergonomics intervention. Many people were still working in bad condition which caused them health, safety, and financial issues. Initial testing was qualitative, importantly the proposed working solution was able to satisfy simulate subject’s more than previous working process in discomfort and pain response categories. It could be used in actual working conditions. Design solution was portable, low cost and even easy to build with locally available materials, those factors made them more acceptable by the Maheshwar weavers. More work can be done in this direction for the device as it cause less trouble during the whole process. Still modifications were required.","master of design, design discipline pdpm indian institute of information technology, design and manufacturing, jabalpur, m.p., india 1610421@iiitdmj.ac.in , pratikmukesh.mukesh@gmail.com",
343,Fleet Management Through Vehicle Routing Problem And  Multi Depot Vehicle Scheduling Problem: A Literature,"nowadays, one of the objectives of fleet management is to reduce fleet size and costs and to improve efficiency at the level of assignment, scheduling, and routing. in this paper, we present a literature review focusing on solution methods by analyzing 245 journal papers dealing with exact methods as well as heuristics and metaheuristics to solve large instances of two main problems in this area, namely the vehicle routing problem (vrp) and the multi depot vehicle scheduling problem (mdvsp).","fleet management, vrp, mdvsp, heuristics","In the present time, transportation management has become increasingly important, especially when we take into consideration the increase in demography and human development, which generate high demands. Therefore, plants implantations have become exponential to meet these demands, making logistics management difficult in terms of supply, shipping, and transportation of personnel; as there are several modes of transportation, this management becomes much more complicated to manage. In our paper, we are interested in the VRP and MDVSP, because they have a common objective which is to reduce the fleet size and then to reduce the costs. The objective of this literature review is to give an idea about the solution methods that have been used to tackle such problems in recent papers in this area. 3033","review ziyad bahou equipe moad6 mohammadia school of engineers mohammed v university of rabat, morocco ziyad.bahou@hotmail.fr jamal elhachmi laboratory of electronics and telecommunications mohammadia school of engineers (emi), rabat, morocco jamal_elhachimi@hotmail.com","References

346,Production System Disturbances Of Heavy Equipment  Component Industry,"the uncertainty of the production system arises in the form of production system disturbances. pt abc is a company that produces heavy equipment components. based on preliminary research, it is known that there is a need to solve the problems of production planning and inventory control (ppic) in the company related to the disturbances of the production systems faced by the company. the purpose of this study is to map the production system disturbances and provide solution to improve the function of ppic in facing the disturbances of the production system at pt abc. based on the key performance indicator (kpi) of ppic, we do mapping of production system disturbances occurs. next, the data processing and analysis are carried out descriptively and by using the classification technique - association rules. the disturbances mapping results show that the high severity disturbances associated with the mrp ppic model, with the type of disturbances of raw materials having a high impact on kpi. the production process cannot run according to planning and scheduling because the flow of information that is less integrated between divisions causes each division to process based on their respective policies. the company needs an improvement in the mrp system in releasing production and ordering of materials, and also control the disturbances of the production system.","uncertainty, production system, disturbances, kpi of ppic","and Future Research The results of the mapping disturbance analysis at PT ABC show that the production process cannot run in accordance with the planning and scheduling that has been made because of the misinformation that also has an impact on KPI achievement. Information flow and information flow and material flow that are the input and output of the company's MRP system do not match what happens on the production floor. The occurrence of a chain of disturbances is caused by a lack of integrated information between divisions and suppliers, so that each division processes based on their respective policies and information systems need to be built regarding MRP functions with integrated databases between each PPIC division where each department related to PPIC functions has access according to their needs. The company needs an improvement in the MRP system and Standard Operation Procedure (SOP) for each division in releasing production and ordering of materials. The company also requires an information system in the form of a dashboard that can display real conditions on the production floor as well as the status of each agreed order, while monitoring the disturbances of the production system that occurs, so that it can immediately control and make adjustments so as to meet the KPI of each PPIC division. Regarding the disturbances of production systems that occur, companies can control the disturbances of the production system that occurs by providing safety stock for raw materials and finished products in order to support the smooth running of business processes and fulfillment of KPIs for each PPIC division in the company. For the future research, we recommend to apply the disturbance control model, as has been done in previous studies in the automotive industry, starting with mapping the production system disturbances in accordance with the relevant KPI, then by utilizing the classification technique approach we got the disturbances control model consists of sub-model of the risk level of the disturbance, sub-model of action status, sub- model action control of the disturbance, and sub-model of determining the safety stock to assist the automotive company in taking the decision to perform the disturbances control action in production system (Marie, 2017).

347,Property Rights On Existing Reconstruction And  Development Program Houses (Rdp)Literature Review,"the major cause of failure in land administration systems in many countries is poor management and lack of good governance. hence, the paper examines previous literature on the impact of property right on low cost housing. the study is conducted with reference to existing theoretical literature review, published and unpublished research by other researchers. one of the primary findings emanating from the study reveals that enhanced political voice and political accountability has an impact on improving the prospects for secure property rights. furthermore if the governments of developing countries provide real property ownership with clear titles and rights enforceable by law, then poor people will be able to use their assets to obtain credit which can be employed in productive activities, and countries could lever themselves and their poor inhabitants out of poverty. the research will make contribution to type of land reform which lead to sustainable development through land titling, a reduction in the probability of being evicted, or otherwise losing land rights and provide land users with greater assurance that they will enjoy the fruits of their labour and investment, thereby encouraging them to make long-term investments for sustainable use of their properties.","property rights, housing, et al.","Literature review revealed that in various developing countries, poor people are essentially excluded from formalizing their land and property rights and, consequently, a black market exists outside of the formal economy. Moreover if the government of developing countries provide real property ownership with clear titles and rights enforceable by law, then poor people will be able to use their assets to obtain credit which can be employed in productive activities so that countries could get themselves and their poor inhabitants out of poverty. Other researchers found that acquiring formal property rights for land does not promote access to housing finance, but instead, the household income is the primary principle to obtain mortgage. Governance on property right is the contributing factor to control the way and purpose which land and buildings occupied by the poor can be used. There should be some point of accountability and intervention to reinforce formal property rights to existing low cost houses in order to enhance quality of life to beneficiaries and socio economic development of the country. There is a need to find a suitable standards for land management system that react to methods of urban land market that clearly address the need of the poor. The objective of the current legislative (Spatial Land Use Management) framework in South Africa is to protect and promote investment but the framework does otherwise for the poor. The Act prevents unauthorized land use that have negative impact on property values. 8. RECOMMENDATIONS The study recommend a balanced socio economic development for beneficiaries of low cost housing holistically. It means the type of land reform that regulates low cost housing should be interlinked. It must not only provide secure tenure without sustainable employment. Secure tenure can only give partial security, whereas combination of security 3069","mashwama nokulunga1, gladness makgobi1 and thwala didi1 1department of construction management and quantity surveying, university of johannesburg/johannesburg, south africa sarchi in sustainable construction management and leadership in the built environment, faculty of engineering and the built environment, university of johannesburg/ johannesburg, south africa {nokulungam, didibhukut}@uj.ac.za, kelebogilemakgobi@gmail.com","References

The vast sums of data are a consequence of jobs from different variety, which generally stored within big data clusters. Big data clustering and scheduling are appearing one of the active research areas which plays a vital role in the completion of big data processing and effectively utilizing the cluster resources. To conclude, viable processing of Exabyte’s of information would require broad parallel handling with a specific end goal to give convenient and significant data. MapReduce based clusters has been appearing as the most effective big data solutions. It empowers parallelism along with several low-end computing nodes. In addition, there is no common task scheduling algorithm to accommodate and handle different type of jobs at the same time. For the future research direction, the big data platform should be able to handle different type of jobs for the processing of big data.

349,Theoretical Examination Of Sustainability On Low Cost  Affordable Housing And Corporate Governance,"one of the constraints faced by low cost housing projects is poor governance, hence the examination of corporate governance and sustainability on low cost housing. literature is the main method used to investigate the research problem. published, unpublished papers and journals were accurately reviewed to find solutions to the subject matter. the study revealed that it is a prerequisite in terms of the national environmental management act for national and provincial department to formulate an environmental implementation plan for any building construction activities that will have an impact on the environment. green and sustainable are the terms congested on yearly reports of companies, but the question is whether the corporate social responsibility is valued. the paper will assist the industry to realise that: the achievement of companies does not rely on compliance of legislation and standards only, but also by a broad series of economic, environment and social problem in a manner that is useful to the whole society globally. organisational sustainability enforces environmental standards to be adhered and iso 14001 standard help companies to improve environmental performance by reducing waste, efficient use of resources, receive integrity of partner and be successful.",compliance,"Currently, organizational sustainability is an established requirements with various mandatory prerequisites through survey enforcing environmental standards to be adhered to. Therefore it is highly recommended that construction companies are good corporate citizens, ensuring responsible business by incorporating Environmental, Sustainability and Governance into their businesses. Compliance to standards and legislative requirements forms the integral part of good corporate governance and sustainability on low cost and affordable green housing and companies. Construction companies are obliged in terms of the National Environmental Management Act for National and provincial department to formulate an Environmental Implementation Plan for any building construction activities that will have an influence on the environment and the constitution of the republic also enforces and regulates the rights of citizens 3077","mashwama nokulunga1, gladness makgobi1 and aigbavboa clinton1 1department of construction management and quantity surveying, university of johannesburg/johannesburg, south africa sarchi in sustainable construction management and leadership in the built environment, faculty of engineering and the built environment, university of johannesburg/ johannesburg, south africa {nokulungam, aigbavboa}@uj.ac.za, kelebogilemakgobi@gmail.com","References

350,Pilot Study: Organizational Creativity In Indonesia’S  Creative Industries,"pilot study is a step to evaluate the effectiveness of survey instrument as a medium of communication between researchers and respondents. this paper aims to get the instrument ready for use on actual data retrieval. pilot study is divided into two stages, qualitative pilot study and quantitative pilot study. in qualitative pilot study, the researcher used nine respondents, while for the quantitative study used 36 respondents. based on the results, the studies obtained the questionnaires are ready to be used in the process of pilot study quantitative. in the pilot quantitative study obtained the result that of the ninety-nine items of question there are four items that are invalid so that should be discarded. for variable reliability, all variables have a cronbach alpha value greater than 0.6 so it can be said that all variables are reliable and used in further surveys.","creative industries, indonesia, qualitative, quantitative","and Suggestions The article discusses the results of pilot study on creativity of creative industries in Indonesia. Qualitative pilot study results in an instrument free from typographical errors, punctuation errors, avoids uncommon or sensitive words and long questionnaire causing respondents to find difficulties to fill. The results of the pilot study were used in stage of quantitative pilot study. Quantitative pilot study is a process to examine the reliability and consistency levels of an instrument used. The stage results in an instrument which is ready to be used for the main study. This study has several drawbacks. First, on the first stage of qualitative study, only respondents of doctoral students were involved. Therefore, further studies should involve respondents of non-industry parties coming from several levels. Second, data obtained from the results of the pilot study can actually be used to identify initial phenomenon of creativity process on creative industries in Indonesia. For that reason, the process should be done not only to test the instrument, but also to identify initial phenomenon occurring in creative industries in Indonesia. Further studies on initial phenomenon of organizational creativity on creative industries in Indonesia should be carried out.","retno indriartiningtias1,2 1doctoral student doctoral in mechanical and industrial engineering department gadjah mada university, yogyakarta, indonesia 2 industrial engineering department trunojoyo university, bangkalan, east java, indonesia a)retno.indriartiningtias@mail.ugm.ac.id/retnotmiitb@gmail.com/retno.indriartiningtias@mail.tr unojoyo.ac.id budi hartono, subagyo mechanical and industrial engineering department gadjah mada university, yogyakarta, indonesia boed@gadjahmada.edu, subagyo@ugm.ac.id","references, definition, and the number of items are depicted in Table 4.

VBA is used to gain exact mathematical optimization. The qualitative and quantitative analysis of data has been done to evaluate the research findings. It is concluded from the study that the overall cost of the petroleum distribution network can be minimized by optimizing the causing critical factors. Thus, this study depicts a distribution network optimization model, with the purpose of minimizing the cost, based on inefficiencies and causing critical factors which are specific for Sri Lankan petroleum industry. As a result, the developed optimization model would enable the Sri Lankan petroleum industry to achieve higher performance leading to competitive advantage.",,
353,Newsvendor Models And Biases Under Ambiguity  Peeyush Mehta,"in this study, we model the classical newsvendor ordering preferences under ambiguity. the extant literature on normative models in the newsvendor setting assumes decision-making under risk, where decision-maker has exact knowledge of the probabilities associated with the outcomes. in several business situations, the demand distribution is often incomplete or unknown. this results in decision- making under ambiguous situations. decision theory recognizes the difference between exact probabilities and more realistic ambiguous probabilities. in his seminal paper, scarf (1958) develops a max-min approach for the newsvendor with incomplete demand information. in the scarf model, the newsvendor is assumed to be risk-neutral and ambiguity averse. in the recent experimental literature, it has been observed that the newsvendor behavior is not consistent with the scarf model, and exhibits pull-to- center bias and other biases. this motivates our research to develop quantitative models under ambiguity to describe the observed biases in the literature.","ambiguity, newsvendor, decision-theory, risk",,"indian institute of management calcutta operations management group kolkata, india – 700104 pmehta@iimcal.ac.in r k amit indian institute of technology madras dept. of management studies chennai rkamit@iitm.ac.in",

356,Model-Based Engineering Of A Process Wash Plant Using  Sysml: Case Study Of Beneficiation Processes In A,"the fourth industrial revolution is being fostered in many countries to make more efficient and flexible plants. industry 4.0 target is to get a more competitive industry. under this framework, improvement of mineral processing requires knowledge of previous methods and current technology in order to develop new techniques and approaches. as phosphate deposition decreases, the need for new recovery methods keeps growing. from this perspective, the need for control and optimization of existing processes becomes a necessity. it also includes the development of equipment with more advanced digitized components. the objective of our work is to develop a model of a process plant using sysml. in this paper, we adopted a system engineering-based approach, which consists on modeling and formalizing knowledge collected in the field. a well understanding of phosphate value chain allows both driving and optimizing current processes. in addition, we used this approach to model information flows in which we integrated a specific equipment in the overall process. this model will follow a systems engineering approach. in this paper we present the development of the sysml model of a process plant (wash plant of phosphate). the model includes the requirements as well as the structure, behaviour and activity 3125",,"Model-Based Engineering is necessary for the engineering of the industry 4.0 systems. In this paper we have developed a SysML model of a process Wash Plant of phosphates. This model can be used for the design of the plant and for all the engineering activities through the plant life cycle. Our adopted approach summarizes various modeling tools working with a well-known industrial partner in Phosphate valorization. Using these approaches, we will guarantee efficient beneficiation processes by optimizing their operating parameters.

357,Analysis Of Inventory Control Planning For P-200 Chip  (Semi Dull) Using Material Requirement Planning,"pt. indonesia toray sinthetic is a textile company. in providing inventory to produce products, it is necessary to have a good inventory control and in accordance with production demand. inventory control in this company often has problems, one of which is excess stock. material requirement planning (mrp) is a method used to control raw material inventories in a company. a company to implement policies in raw material planning must have the right calculation so that there are no excesses and shortcomings in the supply of raw materials. this study used the forecasting method of linear trend analysis, constant, exponential smoothing and moving average. the material requirement planning (mrp) methods used are lot for lot (lfl), economic order quantity (eoq), fixed order quantity (foq), and fixed period requirement (fpr). the best forecasting result is the trend linear analysis with the smallest error value and the best results from the material requirement planning (mrp) method used is the economic order quantity (eoq) with a total save cost of rp 720,000 and the total order cost of rp 68,552,500 with a total total cost of idr 69,272,500. so by using the material requirement planning (mrp) method with the lot sizing technique in the economic order quantity (eoq), the company pt. indonesia toray sinthetic can minimize total inventory costs and be more efficient at rp 81,887,500. - that is, it can be more than 50%.","inventory, forecasting, order cost","and Suggestion 1.1 Conclusion 1. After doing calculations with several forecasting methods, namely Linear Trend method, Constant, Moving Average N = 2 - N = 6, Exponential Smoothing α = 0.1 - α = 0.9. Through several forecasting methods, the Trend Linear Analysis forecasting method is the best and most appropriate forecasting method because it has the smallest error value and does not exceed the control limit in the Moving Range Chart. 2. Inventory control planning is carried out by the Material Requirement Planning (MRP) method with Lot Sizing techniques used are LFL, EOQ, FOQ, FPR. From the results of a comparison of all lot sizing methods, it can be seen that the Lot For Lot (LFL) method and Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) are the best Material Requirement Planning (MRP) methods that produce order values or fees and keep the minimum but for the Lot For Lot method (LFL) if it is realized the method is not appropriate if applied to the company because there is no spare, so the Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) method is also chosen which also has a minimum total cost of Rp 69,272,500.

361,Big Data Tasks Execution Time Analysis Using Machine  Learning Techniques,"big data and its analysis are in the focus of current era. the volume of data production is tremendous and a significant part of delivered data is not utilized because of the limited assets to store and process them efficiently. the world acclaimed platform that can efficiently deal with the gigantic amount of data in a cost effective manner is hadoop mapreduce. in order to effectively utilize any computational platform, information about the components affecting its performance is necessary. similarly, hadoop mapreduce’s performance can be enhanced by identifying those factors that can affect its performance. some researchers provided some schemes for improving total task completion time of big data tasks on hadoop mapreduce by suitable selection and scheduling of processing units i.e. mappers. however, reducers are still underexplored for its effect on the total execution time. this paper aimed at evaluation of reducer’s impact on total execution time of big data tasks on hadoop mapreduce by employing machine learning techniques. the evaluation has been carried out both analytically and experimentally by changing different number of reducers across various types and length of tasks. the results clearly depicts the dependence of total mapreduce task execution time on the number of reducers.","big data, machine learning, hadoop mapreduce","Hadoop MapReduce has been considered as the promising and acceptable platform for big data tasks processing. Hadoop MapReduce has many configuration parameters and their optimal tuning can significantly increase total task completion time of big data tasks on Hadoop MapReduce. In this paper, an underexplored factor that is the number of reducers is evaluated for its effect on overall task execution time of Big data tasks in Hadoop MapReduce. Several simulations has been done by different number of reducers and also by varying the input data sizes. It has been observed that the variation of the number of reducers influences the total tasks execution time. The results from the Fig. 6 depicts that changing the number of reducers has a significantly effect on total completion time for particular values. As shown in Figure 6 that by increasing the number of reducers with varying the input data sizes has follows a trend line which shows a dip for each input or task. But the value of the reducer that is, the number of reducers showing the best execution time for each input data size is different. In addition, Machine learning technique that is, Regression has been used for the qualifying criteria. The evaluation results evidently shows the dependence of the total execution time on the number of reducers. The results are also validated through regression analysis p-value. From the Table II we can see that p- value is greater than 0.05 which means replication factor contributes as major to total completion time. Consequently, it has a substantial effect on overall performance of the Hadoop MapReduce also. 3174","aisha shabbir, kamalrulnizam abu bakar and raja zahilah raja mohd. radzi school of computing university technology malaysia, johor, malaysia saisha3@graduate.utm.my, knizam@utm.my, zahilah@utm.my muhammad siraj department of information engineering & computer science university of trento, trento, italy muhammad.siraj@alumni.unitn.it","References

367,Heuristics For Course Planning In Degree Programs Kingsley Gnanendran,"higher education institutions today operate in an environment characterized, among other factors, by limited financial resources, stringent academic accreditation requirements, and heightened student expectations in terms of the expected time-to-degree, convenience/flexibility, and variety of choice in course offerings. in this talk, we investigate heuristic approaches for planning an appropriate mix of future courses to be offered in non-lockstep programs. subject to a maximum time limit, such programs permit students to take alternative pathways and timelines to the degree based on their personal interests, time and cost pressures, and workplace or family commitments. assuming that a long-range plan for course cycling is already in place at the institution, this paper solely focuses on techniques to modify such plans for the near-term based on an analysis of the progress of currently active cohorts with regard to time (delay) and cost (overrun). using novel definitions of the well-known project performance measures (earned value, planned value, and actual cost) applicable to the educational context, we derive estimates of expected time-to-degree and expected cost for each cohort. based on these computations, we are able to recommend guidelines for heuristically adjusting the long-range course cycling plan.","project management, heuristics",,"oim department the university of scranton scranton, pa 18510, usa skingsley.gnanendran@scranton.edu manohar madan itscm department university of wisconsin-whitewater whitewater, wi 53190, usa madanm@uww.edu",
368,Supply Chain Strategy For Ayamas Food Cooperation,"this paper presents the case study of ayamas food cooperation sdn. bhd. (afc), focusing on the company strategy for its supply chain management (scm). the data was gathered from the company’s official website and related documents retrieved early in the year (2018). the overall information of the strategy was identified from these main segments of scm: supplier, manufacturer and distribution up to retailer / customer. the types of food product were clearly categorized and many of them were highly demanded as fast-moving items. the scm strategy across these segments is crucial and therefore communication system is emphasized not only for efficiency purposes, but also responding to the reactive demand. it is identified that there is a clear competitive advantage (ca) strategy for afc. although afc is performing well as indicated by the manufacturing volume, this paper identifies a gap in terms of logistics and distribution. this paper also presents some proposal for improvement.",halal,"For improvement, the importance of these three factors need to be emphasized, i.e. flow of material, flow of financial and flow of information. The flow of material and financial is much affected by the effective and efficient information flow. Information sharing between all stakeholders will enable specific CA strategies for SCM be planned. The flow of information must be accurate and at speed, particularly in the current environment of Industry 4.0 (IR4.0). Technology in informatics and Internet of Things are there for Ayamas to explore and exploit, leading to solutions in logistics between suppliers, manufacturers and distributors. For proper monitoring, database system needs to be developed for records, information sharing, and safer data security, fast and accurate. For example, the BigFarm Net Manager database is a software that can be used in developing ‘smart poultry’, which is aligned with the development of IR4.0 (Zhu, Anagondahalli, & Zhang, 2017). This would also enable the company to monitor and control not only the SCM but the processes at the poultry or farmhouse, like the house atmosphere in controlling and monitoring the settings of water, light, and other requirements suited to the customers. The use of the latest system covers all aspects of poultry supplies, manufacturers and distributors, whereas all the information on the number of poultry, poultry care, the delivery of raw chicken to the factory, and the delivery of the product to the customer could be properly and optimally managed. The system can also be developed to collect the customer's feedback. The strategies for competitive advantage include differentiation, speed and cost leadership, which in this case, AFC adopts the differentiation strategy. In the supply section, costs, better cost control, and the capacity to supply the quick growing open poultry demand for the local and abroad market are taken care of. Their handling plants process poultry for eateries all through KFC Holding, and spotlight on accomplishing cost-proficiency while keeping up halal and amazing gauges. Meanwhile, in the manufacturing segment, customers’ preferences need to be alerted by AFC, even though the varieties of chicken-based products were already insight of Ayamas. That is because, change in trend and new recipe demand is part of the culture not only for local people, but must also cater for the global markets. In the distribution section, there are several measures that could be adopted for instance from Europe, where several refrigerated warehouses are already built with eco-friendly technology. This kind of warehouse releases no cfc gases which will contribute to better environment. If AFCB uses this type of warehouse, they are not just doing their social responsibility but also encourages other company to do the same thing, thus, Malaysia will be a better place to live in. Additionally, another type of modern warehouse is one which is attached with solar panels to the roof. Using solar energy will help AFC to reduce its cost in warehousing especially about reducing the electricity bill. Finally, AFC should aware that information sharing is important in supply chain management between three (3) segments, i.e. supplier, manufacturer and distribution until to customer or retailer. Smoothness and accuracy flow of information will affect the flow of material and financial in terms of efficiency and effectiveness. 3227","ts. razni khalid razak faculty of technology and informatics, universiti teknologi malaysia, 54100 kuala lumpur, malaysia meffendi.amran@gmail.com, habibahharon.kl@utm.my, azizimohdnoor@gmail.com, raznikhalid@gmail.com","References

369,Resource Optimization For Wastewater Management In  Paint Manufacturing Plants: Case Study,"wastewater from paint manufacturing concerns can be very harmful to the ecosystem if not effectively managed. discharge of such water into the environment can pose danger to plants and animals. in an attempt to combat the problem, an intensive study has been conducted in this paper to optimize the effectiveness of wastewater management, through exploration of alternative treatment resources. data was sourced from an existing wastewater treatment plant of a paint manufacturing company at the mpumalanga province, east of south africa. the plant is currently using lime as a coagulant and an electrolyte as a flocculent. use of new chemical reagents- ferric chloride and aluminum chlorohydrate were investigated it the laboratory. both of the reagents explored gave better results that what obtains with lime. while the existing and newly introduced reagents proved to be useful in controlling the wastewater, the ammonium chlorohydrate demonstrated stronger reduction capabilities in most of the wastewater indices tested.","wastewater, management","This study has satisfied the cleavage of presenting possible resource optimization for wastewater management in paint manufacturing plants. An illustrative example case of a Paint manufacturing Plant located at Mpumalanga Province, East of South Africa have been set. The results of experimental investigation were displayed in clear figures to remove any form of ambiguity. The Aluminum chloride dosage was 25ppm, and the Ferric Chloride dosage was 120ppm. Ferric Chloride can work efficiently on a Batch process and may require two settling tanks because its floccs settle a bit slower than the Aluminum Chlorohydrate, while Aluminum Chlorohydrate can work in a continous process and may require one settling tank because it generate floccs settle very fast. The overall quality of wastewater from the treatment plant can be optimised using the procedure described in this paper. The methodologies followed during the research can be implemented in wastewater treatment facilities of other spheres. However, we recommend that a settling tank can be installed for evacuation of the resulting floccs.

370,Red Bin Analysis The Art Of Problem Solving In  Manufacturing Industry,"the problem solving, especially in the manufacturing sector has a very diverse and rich background. be it the ford era or the bell's lab where dr. shewart developed the statistical process control (spc) or the epic 1950 research by nasa for development of failure mode and effect analysis (pfmea), the problem-solving approach has taken leaps and have stretched to become an essential function and role of any successful manufacturing industry. today, the survival of any corporate entity would be difficult and would be full of risk, if, the problem solving is not an integral part of their ecosystem. in the manufacturing industry, problem-solving was used to be done as soon as an abnormality/failure/defect has been found or introduced. the team used to do the root cause analysis using why-why analysis, fish-bone methodology or 8d problem-solving approach etc. such methodologies are very strong and still are used very efficiently. if the scale of the problem is very large or it is chronic problem, then strategies like six sigma, total quality management, lean manufacturing or total productive maintenance are also used. now through kaizens, poka-yoke and other approaches, problem-solving have seen a phase shift from reactive to a preventive one. the problem is now being prevented even before the occurrence. the concern and a question over these strategies and methodologies are that these are meant to be for everyone and here, everyone means every type of industry irrespective of their market and size. they can be large, medium, small or even micro-enterprise. large enterprises can afford to do all the quality training, up-gradation and they can also spend on automation. even medium enterprises can also bear those expenses for a while but what about those small and micro-enterprises. most of the supply-chain of oem manufacturing industries are medium, small and micro- enterprises. largely the quality of the final product is also the responsibility of the supply chain. how these enterprises will be able to cater to such increasing quality needs and dimension? how will they be able to become a problem- solving enterprise without investing much on this front? the answer to this is the ""red-bin analysis"". it is a different problem-solving methodology based on quality control circle method focusing on the problem occurrence, detection and solving at the source of generation. this method highlights and explains the problem selection and its solution which is very efficient in case of problem-solving of sub-assemblies or sub-components at the supply chain tier-1, tier-2 or tier-3 level. 3240",,,"sumit shandilya school of management bml munjal university gurgaon, haryana, india - 122413 sumit.shandilya@bmu.edu.in, sumit.shandilya.15pd@bml.edu.in dr. jaskiran arora school of management bml munjal university gurgaon, haryana, india - 122413 jaskiran.arora@bmu.edu.in dr. kalluri vinayak school of engineering & technology bml munjal university gurgaon, haryana, india - 122413 kalluri.vinayak@bmu.edu.in",
371,Minimizing Mean Weighted Expected Tardiness By  Integrating Preventive Maintenance And Production,"manufacturing industry that produces various plastic packaging products experience high frequency of machine breakdowns that consequently cause tardiness in completing orders. based on importance, orders are given different weights of priorities. the earliest due date rule method that is currently used for production scheduling, is causing delays in multiple job completions, increasing average tardiness. currently, both corrective maintenance and production scheduling are planned separately, even though both are intertwined. given the strong correlation between the two, this study seeks to integrate preventive maintenance and production scheduling to generate production schedules that can minimize the mean weighted expected tardiness. data processing starts by identifying machines with highest downtime value and identifying critical machine components that are causing downtimes. based on data collection and processing, injection machine 650-ton has the highest down time. by calculating preventive maintenance, we obtain time intervals for inspection and preventive replacements for each component. following that, orders are sorted using single machine scheduling, resulting in a mean weighted expected tardiness of 78 hours. by integrating preventive maintenance and production scheduling, the mean weighted expected tardiness resulted in 43 hours. after using genetic algorithm, the mean weighted expected tardiness further declines to 32 hours.",,"Injection Machine 650-ton is the most critical machine with largest downtime percentage of 18%, machine inspection time interval of 78 hours and component replacement time interval of 162 hours (nozzle component). The current job scheduling method using EDD priority (job sequence 2-1-4-3-6-5) without any preventive maintenance (PM) causes average delays of 77.959 hours. Integrating job scheduling with preventive maintenance resulted in job sequence of 2-1-6-4-5-3 and PMs prior to job number 6, 5 and 3. PM is determined by considering time intervals for machine inspection, component replacement with the least time interval and non-preemptive production process. Post integration, we arrive at a mean weighted expected tardiness of 42.9055 hours. Mean weighted expected tardiness decreases by 44.9% by integrating job scheduling and preventive maintenance. Integrating scheduling with PM using genetic algorithm with job sequence 2-1-4-6-5-3 and PM prior to job number 4, 5, and 3 resulted in the mean weighted expected tardiness of 32.0623 hours.

372,A Quantitative Approach For Similarity Comparison Of The  Terminologies In Standard Documents,"the application of standards is effective for ensuring the expected function of a system in a specific scenario. a key step of the standard enaction or implementation is to precisely comprehend the terminologies in the standards via literal comparison. current methods for such comparison usually rely heavily on labor, which is time consuming and error-prone. with the rapid increase in the number of the standard documents, it is essential to develop an approach to automatize the comparison process. in this work, we proposed a methodology for the computerized comparison of the terms and definitions in standards. based on the standard structures, the methodology is developed in three steps: the pdf (portable document format) text conversion, the terms and definitions extraction, and comparison. (1) according to the pdf types, either scanned or digitally created, we provided corresponding methods for converting the pdf files. (2) regarding the terms and definitions extraction, we identified content structures and logical elements, and extracted definition sections and terms. (3) for the comparison step, we evaluated the similarities between the terminologies from the semantic and syntactic aspects. reliability, availability, maintainability, and safety (rams) are crucial attributes to evaluate the performance of a system. in the experimental studies, we compared the rams standards issued by iec, ieee, iso, and the society for automotive engineering (sae). the results show that the proposed methodology is capable of evaluating the similarities of the terms and definitions in standards. biography / biographies huixing meng is currently a postdoctoral researcher at the reliability & risk management laboratory, department of industrial engineering, tsinghua university, beijing, china. he received his ph.d in computer science from ecole polytechnique, palaiseau, france in 2018. his current research areas include the system reliability assessment and risk assessment with the application onto energy systems. kanittha setthapitayakul was a master student of global manufacturing in the department of industrial engineering, tsinghua university, beijing, china. yan-fu li is currently a professor at industrial engineering department in tsinghua university. he was a faculty member of the laboratory of industrial engineering at centralesupélec, university of paris-saclay, france, from 2011 to 2016. his current research interests include rams (reliability, availability, maintainability, safety) assessment and optimization with the applications onto various industrial systems. he has led/participated in several projects supported by eu, france and chinese governmental funding agencies and various industrial partners. he has co- authored over 90 publications, on international journals, conference proceedings and books. he is an associate editor of ieee transactions on reliability and a senior member of the ieee. 3254",,,"huixing meng, kanittha setthapitayakul and yan-fu li department of industrial engineering tsinghua university beijing, china liyanfu@tsinghua.edu.cn",

With the use of the social media data of users, the algorithm that we have introduced in this paper will be very useful in finding personalized products for the users. Analytics being used on social media data can give us insights about users’ interests which are crucial in finding the products aligned with their likeability.

375,The Influence Of Organisational Culture On Students’  Satisfaction In Saudi Arabia,"organizational culture and students’ satisfaction are among critical factors for any university. although these concepts have attracted considerable interests from both academics and practitioners, there are few studies that examine the relationship between them in different culture like saudi arabia. hence, the present study investigates influence of organisational culture on students’ satisfaction in saudi arabia as well as to evaluate the impact of each sub-element of organizational culture on students’ satisfaction. this is due to the belief that the unsatisfied student might choose to abandon their study. therefore, the present study aims to explore the relationship between organisational culture dimensions and overall satisfaction. the present study was conducted on 1534 students randomly drawn using questionnaire method. the statistical tool used to test the hypothesized model is the structural equation modelling with amos version 24. the results obtained indicates significant positive impact between organisational culture dimensions and students’ satisfaction. the finding showed that out of the four dimensions of organizational culture, four have influence on students’ satisfaction. based on these results it can be said that university administration should take into consideration students’ organisational culture as well as their satisfaction in order to enhance their academic outcomes.","saudi arabia, which in turn","The results of this study confirmed that organisational culture is positively related to students satisfaction which is not surprising as some studies have found the same in different settings as seen in (Saleem et al., 2017; Trivellas&Dargenidou, 2009; Mcclelland et al., 2008). However, what makes this study different is conducting it in other context with a different culture in Saudi Arabia. Also, this study focused on investigating the effect of organizational culture dimensions (participation, consistency, adaptability and mission) on students’ satisfaction. To this effect, SEM analysis was employed in the present for the analysis of the related variables and this paper provides similar outcomes in which organisational culture significantly and positively predicts student’s satisfaction students in their academic context. Hence the outcome of this study supported that better organisational culture environment will equally improve the level of satisfaction among Saudi university students. The results showed that three organizational culture dimensions (consistency, adaptability and mission) have a significant influence on students’ satisfaction. Hence hypotheses 1, 3 and 4 are supported while the second hypothesis regarding the participation turned up insignificant effect on students’ satisfaction. The study results provided evidence that organizational culture has a strong influence over students’ satisfaction. While organizational culture has so far been highly studied in the realm of various other field and subjects, particularly in corporate management, universities are yet to embrace it. This study suggests that universities administrators must now pay attention to organizational culture as it is reminiscent of their students’ satisfaction and overall institutions performance. On the basis of findings of this study this research recommends that university administration should create supportive organizational culture in their institutions in order to raise the students’ satisfaction which in turn will influence their academic performance and loyalty to the university. 6.","saad aziz al-otaibi azman hashim international business school, universiti teknologi malaysia, jalan sultan yahya petra (jalan semarak), 54100 kuala lumpur, malaysia. s.a.z.1433@gmail.com sha’ri mohd yusof razak faculty of technology and informatics, universiti teknologi malaysia, jalan sultan yahya petra (jalan semarak), 54100 kuala lumpur, malaysia shari@utm.my wan khairuzamanwan ismail sulaimanalrajhi school of business, sulaimanalrajhi colleges, alqassim 51941, kingdom of saudi arabia. w.khairuzzaman@sr.edu.sa",

In this paper, we have considered linear fractional inventory modelling GIFNs and maximize the profit and minimize the holding cost related to per-ordered quantity with some realistic set of constraints. The formulated problem solved unless it converted into an equivalent deterministic problem, which has been done by using possibility and necessity measures. This model solve using soft computing technique generalized reduced gradient (GRG) method (Lingo-14.0). The optimal result of the proposed model given in Table 2.

377,Smosa Optimization Approach To A Multi Objective Model  For A Machine Tool Selection And Operation Allocation,"this paper considers a difficult of dynamic match inner-tool election and distribution of operation with part and tool movement policies in a flexible manufacturing system (fms) environment. for this design, a novel 0-1 non linear integer programming multi objective model is demonstrated in such a way that each tool and each part can move during the production phase. it is assumed that there are sets of tools and machines that can manufacture different kinds of orders (or part types). therefore, in this study, we make use of one of the various objective decision-making methods, a global criterion approach, to improve a multi-objective model for find a solution fms scheduling problems with payment of two performance measures, namely minimum machining cost, set up cost as first objective and minimum machining time, tools and parts transportation time and machines average idle time as second objective, at the same time. smosa algorithm approach is applied to optimize the model and the outcomes of the computational experiments are reported.",smosa,"This paper considers the machine–tool selection and operation allocation problem and exhibits the effectiveness of the MOSA algorithm to address the same. The objective taken into account are to determine the optimal combinations for the machine and tool for operations keeping in mind the minimization of various costs; namely, machining cost, set-up cost ,part transportation cost between machines , tools handling cost and average machines idle time . The constraint posed by the system are pertaining to tool life, tool magazine capacity and machining time. The proposed model is optimized by MOSA algorithm. Some of the salient features of this work can be enlisted as follows: 1. This paper applies the concept of Multi objective to address problems close to real-life industrial scenarios. 2. The application of meta – heuristic proves be better than integer programming formulation in terms of solution quality for the real-life problems of large size. 3. The parameters for the MOSA-based approach have been selected in a manner that computational time and solution quality may remain optimal. 3288","problem in fms roozbeh azizmohammadi department of industrial engineering, payame noor university, tehran,iran roozbeh_mie@yaho.com abbas mahmoudabadi department of industrial engineering, mehrastan university, guilan, iran mahmoudabadi@mehrastan.ac.ir","References

378,Modeling Analysis In Furniture Company By Using System  Dynamics,"x ltd. is a manufacturing company that produces office furniture, such as table, drawer, and office cabinet. main raw material of office furniture products by x ltd. is particle board. errors in decision making in particle board supplies can affect the production cycle which has an impact on increasing waste, cost, and decreasing profit. the right decision-making analysis using the system dynamics model can help logistics manager in determining the right strategy in achieving optimal results while increasing company profits and minimizing costs. the ame calculation for model validation produces a value of 14.74% (raw material stock ready), 14.79% (customer demand), 4.65% (finished goods), and 7.48% (profit). the results of the system dynamics model simulation found that scenario 1 is the best decision scenario for company with average growth rates for raw materials of ready stock amounting to 644 pcs-2125 pcs, customer demand of 256 pcs-408 pcs, finished goods of 43 pcs-977 pcs, and profit of rp. 794,879,346.00-rp. 1,841,444,136.00.","system dynamics, raw material stock, furniture, profit","Researchers produced conclusions and suggestions for the management of X Ltd.. Based on the analysis and discussion presented in the previous chapter, wecan conclude some of the following: 1. The BAU condition of X Ltd. management system projection model shows that in 2017-2018, X Ltd. experienced a decrease in the company's profit level of Rp 788,340,648.00 (starting from Rp 4,717,927,337.00 (in 2017) to Rp 3,929,586,689, 00 (in 2018)). The finished good level has steadily increased from 2015 to 2017 by 2057 pcs (in 2015) to 4656 pcs (in 2017) following the fulfillment of fluctuating customer demand of 2200 pcs (in 2015) to 3169 pcs (in 2017). Decreasing company profits in the period 2017 to 2018 causes company needs to simulate and design new alternative strategies to overcome problems, and increase output to the optimum point. 2. X Ltd. company profit increase is influenced by the number of optimal raw material stock ready that are able to meet the needs of finished goods production to meet customer demands. The minimization of waste warehouse, the level of raw material return, and the amount of WIP can reduce the cost of the warehouse and production section. Increased custom production, domestic sales, and export companies can increase the number of finished goods production companies and increase the number of company profits as a result of the many products sold to the market both locally (domestic) and overseas (export). 3. Alternative strategies to overcome crisis problems will determine the optimal raw material inventory to the level of finished goods production in meeting customer demand at X Ltd. is by intervening in raw material return variables, raw material checks, raw material purchases, warehouse stock, waste warehouse, production targets, WIP percentage, safety stock percentage, and domestic sales percentage. 4. The decision scenario chosen by the company is scenario 1 with the company's profit level starting to increase steadily from 2018 until 2020. The increase that occurs at the profit level is Rp 794,879,346.00 (2018 to 2019) and amounting to Rp 1,841,444,136.00 (2019 to 2020). The level of finished goods has increased significantly with an average growth of 43 pcs-977 pcs. The customer demand level has increased steadily with an average growth of 256 pcs-408 pcs. The level of raw stock ready material has increased with an average growth of 644 pcs-2125 pcs. The reason the company chose scenario 1 as the selected scenario was the trend in data for company profits and other levels that had a trend that increased stably and significantly than the other two scenarios. 01 Jan 01 Jul 01 Jan 01 Jul 01 Jan 01 Jul 01 Jan 01 Jul 01 Jan 01 Jul 01 Jan 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2.500 3.000 3.500 4.000 pcs Customer Demand 15 16 17 18 19 3.000 4.000 5.000 6.000 pcs Raw Material Stock Ready 15 16 17 18 19 2.000 3.000 4.000 5.000 pcs Finished Goods 2.015 2.016 2.017 2.018 2.019 4.000.000.000 5.000.000.000 6.000.000.000 7.000.000.000 Rp Profit Non-commercial use only! 3301","kevin oktavian, ahmad ahmad, lilyana jap, and lina gozali departement of industrial engineering universitas tarumanagara grogol petamburan, west jakarta, indonesia oktakevin26@gmail.com, ahmad@ft.untar.ac.id, lilyanajap@yahoo.com, ligoz@ymail.com","References

380,Stochastic Modeling Of Rail Under-Head Failure Risks  Sagheer Ranjha,"rail failure is one of the serious problems in the railway industry. rail failures can significantly impact rail safety as well as foster numerous maintenance challenges. a better understanding of the parameters that lead to rail failures and the ability to predict their uncertainties would result in the facilitation of a more focused maintenance procedure. rail under-head failure (ruf) occurrence is common in heavy haul rail operations and hence chosen for the modelling and discussions presented in this paper. stochastic risk analysis of ruf was conducted to determine the probability of its occurrence. the parameters included in the analysis are: vertical elastic foundation of the rail, daily and/or seasonal temperature variances, headwear, a contact patch offset (cpo) and the lateral to vertical force ratio (l/v) acting on the rail head. the methodology involves both qualitative and quantitative risk analyses of the above failure parameters. the qualitative analysis was performed by using fault tree analysis and boolean algebra to determine minimum cut sets. further, the failure parameter probabilities for the developed quantitative model are assigned after consulting expert opinion and previous research. a simple quantitative model using triangular distributions was created to serve as a template to perform more complex quantitative modelling with higher level probabilistic distributions. the results were analysed and compared with existing research. the results indicated 14-23.5% probability for ruf occurrence in 90% of the cases. both the simple and complex models had very similar results and displayed skewness’s that match previous infrastructural studies on risk analysis. the results conclude that appropriate actions should be taken in maintenance planning to prevent the parameters that can lead to ruf.",failure analysis,"Rail failures such as rail under-head failure (RUF) are inevitable and hence a major concern for the railway industry. RUF occurrence is significant in heavy haul rail operations. Stochastic risk analysis of RUF was conducted and the parameters considered are: vertical elastic foundation of the rail, daily and/or seasonal temperature variances, headwear, contact patch offset (CPO), and the lateral to vertical force ratio (L/V) acting on the rail head. The results revealed that if one or combination of basic events in the fault tree happens then the RUF has a probability of occurrence is between 14-23.5%, which is significant. The input probabilities have come about from expert opinion and previous research, so it can be concluded that this is a fairly accurate model. Moreover, the results resemble a lognormal distribution, which confirms to the previously verified models in the literature. The parameters that lead to RUF should be thoroughly considered, and suitable maintenance planning strategies should be implemented in order to develop preventative mitigation of these failures.

384,Models And Metaheuristics For The  Pollution Traveling Salesman Problem,"we introduce the “pollution traveling salesman problem” (ptsp), a generalization of the well-known traveling salesman problem which aims at finding a hamiltonian tour that minimizes a function of fuel consumption (dependent on distance traveled, vehicle speed and vehicle load) and driver costs. we present a mixed integer linear programming (milp) model for the ptsp, enhanced with subtour elimination constraints, and propose an iterated local search (ils) metaheuristic algorithm. the ils algorithm first builds a feasible tour, based on the solution of the linear programming (lp) relaxation of the milp model, and then loops between three phases: perturbation, local search and acceptance criterion. the results obtained by the ils algorithm on instances with up to 50 customers are compared with those found by a cut-and-branch algorithm based on the enhanced milp model. the results show the effectiveness of the ils algorithm, which can find the best solution for about 99% of the instances within short computing times.",milp model,,"paolo toth, valentina cacchiani, carlos contreras-bolton dei, university of bologna viale risorgimento 2, 40136 bologna, italy paolo.toth@unibo.it john w. escobar pontificia universidad javeriana, cl. 18 #118-250, cali, colombia luis m. escobar-falcon technological university of pereira, cl. 27 #10-02 barrio a´ lamos, pereira, colombia rodrigo linfati university of bio bio, av. collao 1202, concepcion, chile",

Qualitative pilot study results in an instrument free from typographical errors, punctuation errors, avoids uncommon or sensitive words and long questionnaire causing respondents to find difficulties to fill. The results of the pilot study were used in stage of quantitative pilot study. Quantitative pilot study is a process to examine the reliability and consistency levels of an instrument used. The stage results in an instrument which is ready to be used for the main study. This study has several drawbacks. First, on the first stage of qualitative study, only respondents of doctoral students were involved. Therefore, further studies should involve respondents of non-industry parties coming from several levels. Second, data obtained from the results of the pilot study can actually be used to identify initial phenomenon of creativity process on creative industries in Indonesia. For that reason, the process should be done not only to test the instrument, but also to identify initial phenomenon occurring in creative industries in Indonesia. Further studies on initial phenomenon of organizational creativity on creative industries in Indonesia should be carried out.","retno indriartiningtias1,2 1doctoral student doctoral in mechanical and industrial engineering department gadjah mada university, yogyakarta, indonesia 2 industrial engineering department trunojoyo university, bangkalan, east java, indonesia a)retno.indriartiningtias@mail.ugm.ac.id/retnotmiitb@gmail.com/retno.indriartiningtias@mail.tr unojoyo.ac.id budi hartono, subagyo mechanical and industrial engineering department gadjah mada university, yogyakarta, indonesia boed@gadjahmada.edu, subagyo@ugm.ac.id","references, definition, and the number of items are depicted in Table 4.

389,Reasoning Types In Industrial Engineering/Operations  Management Processes,"operations management/industrial engineering modeling process entails a series of research paradigm decisions to be made as to (1) what the reality domain is - ontology, (2) how the problem domain is to be defined and theorized - epistemology, and (3) which solution domain is to be considered – methodology; and all three being based on axiological assumptions entailing ethical concerns. these paradigm-related decisions need to be based on a series of sound reasoning activities. in this regard, three types of reasoning – abductive, deductive and inductive – will be discussed in connection with a scheme of operational research/management science modeling process. 1. introduction it is interesting to observe that the reasoning types of abduction, induction, and deduction have not been made much of a concern in the operations management/industrial engineering. there are only very few studies that explicitly examines the roles of reasoning types in modeling process. in neighboring fields, however, such as system dynamics, cavana and mares (2004) explicitly use deductive reasoning to justify a policy that was already put into practice. organization science researchers, on the other hand, are more verbal and vociferous about the roles of reasoning types in research. for instance, ketokivi and mantere (2010) suggest two strategies for inductive reasoning in organizational research. van de ven (2007) discusses the roles of abduction, induction, and deduction at some length in connection with theory building. we assert that there is a need for a sound understanding of the roles of abduction, induction, and deduction in all stages of a modeling process. well-informed uses of this triad of syllogism will enhance modeling process since the models thus constructed will be more valid and legitimate in the eyes of relevant stakeholders – model builders, model users, and model assessors. proceedings of the international conference on industrial engineering and operations management bangkok, thailand, march 5-7, 2019 © ieom society international 3360",,,"muhittin oral graduate school of business ozyegin university istanbul, turkey muhittin.oral@ozyegin.edu.tr ossama kettani modellium inc. centre ville québec city, canada ossama.kettani@modellium.com","References

These services offer responsiveness to consumer demand and help reduce distribution costs in the supply chain. Warehouse and distribution management involves a complex task to ensure on-time delivery of quality goods to customers when needed. The study made a review of the current warehouse and distribution operation of a 3PL service provider in the Philippines. It was found that bottlenecks in the receiving and dispatching goods were present which made the productivity and operational efficiency lower than targeted. The use of simulation enabled the researchers to better analyze the processes, identify bottlenecks in the operation, and measure the efficiency level. The important elements that affect productivity and efficiency include the method of loading and unloading process, availability or type of material handling equipment used, and manpower accessibility. Considering these drivers, a model simulator was used to develop a new warehouse design utilizing a conveyor system. The new system will not only increase efficiency but will also improve utilization rate of resources, increase productivity, and increase capacity.","josephine d. german, maria katrina t. asuncion, louie e. pacheco school of industrial engineering and engineering management mapúa university, intramuros, manila, philippines jdgerman@mapua.edu.ph mktasuncion@gmail.com patchi_co@yahoo.com",
394,Preparation Of Polyacrylamide Grafted Onto Magnetic  Cellulose As Flocculant In Wastewater Pre-Treatment,"recently, many efforts has been made to improve the potency of natural polymer-based flocculants in wastewater treatment. graft copolymerization of magnetic cellulose and polyacrylamide (pam-g-magcell) were synthesized through microwave assisted technique with the aid of ceric-ion-induced as catalyst. through varying the monomer, polysaccharide and mass of catalyst, five grades of pam-g-magcell were synthesized. the influences of these factors toward grafting percentage were investigate. the flocculation performance of pam-g-magcell was also studied in treating anaerobically-treated palm oil mill effluent (anpome). the grafting ratio suggested that the optimum conditions for graft copolymerization were composed of 0.25 g catalyst ceric ammonium nitrate and 4:1 mass ratio of acrylamide monomer to magnetic cellulose. the results found that under such optimum conditions, flocculation performance had improved, whereby, sampled wastewater coloration and suspended solid were significantly reduced by 50% and 65%, respectively.","acrylamide, cellulose, flocculation, microwave assisted","PAM-g-MagCell 1 yielded the highest grafting percentage and good flocculation performance in removing TSS and color presence in AnPOME. The study on catalyst concentration also observed that minimal amount of CAN (0.25g) had managed to produce the highest grafting and removal percentages. Among the grafted grades, copolymers having fewer but longer PAM chains showed better flocculation performance than those with shorter PAM chains, owing to easy approachability of the dangling grafted chains to attach to contaminants. Microwave assisted are proven to be the best option to enhance the grafting process between monomer and natural polymer as backbone. In overall, the results support the objectives in this study.

The endeavor has been accomplished in previous research papers as well. However, this research paper offers a new approach for the development of thermodynamic model of a VARS and that is by using software called Engineering Equation Solver (EES). The model of a VAR developed using EES can be put to a parametric analysis which would help in suggesting design modifications in a VARS for the improvement of its COP.

All the shopping centre is a top 5 shopping centre in Malaysia based on size and criteria for each shopping centre. The criteria were come out from the literature review of shopping centre in over the world. The criteria and categorized shopping centre were chosen through the benchmarking analysis. Then, the Delphi Method was used to validate the criteria of shopping centre for the 3 rounds. All the shopping centre was used as a respondents sampling for the next data collection. Each shopping centre has 10 respondents which are involve tenant, customer and worker. Since the shopping centre has 10 categorize, the total is 440 respondents. However, this study to purpose for grading of shopping centre to help the owners rank portfolio holdings and shed low-scoring properties. Lenders use it in a similar manner. Retailers often use grading to help them evaluate the setting for which their stores exist. (ICSC, 2009). PriceWaterhouseCoopers (PWC) used expert opinion from retail real-estate-industry professionals to create a grading system for regional malls. Although its survey-based system has been recast in mid-2009, PWC’s regional-mall classification remains based on sales-per-sq-ft evaluations, which is its shorthand for easy classification of a host of factors that would impact the sales performance. It can be betterment benchmarking for Malaysian property industry in general and expected to provide insights to the stakeholders in improving their investment and business decision of the shopping centre in Malaysia and also can be more attractive shopping centre for tourism purpose.

407,Application Of Multi-Criteria Decision Making (Mcdm)  Tools In Governance Evaluation Of Accessible And Inclusive,"this research posits that the issue of accessible and inclusive developments (aiud) is perhaps one of the most discussed and researched subjects under the broad rubric of sustainable urban developments. aiud are developments that ensures accessibility for and inclusion of persons with disabilities in all aspects of developments and follow universal design approach by removing barriers to the physical environment, transportation, employment, education, health, services, information and assistive devices such as information and communications technology (icts) to achieve fullest potential and dependency for all society members. in spite of the vast focus of discourse and practice or policy on aiud, a major concern and rationale for this study is the poor or inadequate evaluation of aiud governance evaluation, due primarily to lack of coherent, standard and applicable evaluation tool. aiud is known as a dynamic complex environment involving multi sectors and multi stakeholders which leads to challenges for decision makers in successful implementation. therefore, this research propose research methodology for developing a 3494",,"While Accessible and Inclusive Urban Development is gaining world wide concern due to states aspiration to comply with global movement driven by the United Nations emphasis on Sustainable Development Goals, active efforts is witnessed to develop policies and initiatives to implement inclusive developments. AIUD is a complex field involving multi sectoral and multi stakeholders with high uncertainty. Different fields with similar characteristics have utilized governance principles to develop governance evaluation models to evaluate governance performance in specific fields such as environment, coastal management, protected areas and transit oriented developments. Yet, regardless of these efforts, there is lack of governance evaluation models to evaluate governance performance in the field of AIUD. This research proposes a methodology to develop governance evaluation model in the field of AIUD using MCDM tools which will introduce a powerful tool to allow support to decision making and resource allocation, allow comparing performance between different cities/ countries, assessing quality of governance to demonstrate performance and identify needed improvement, allow public participation and create a knowledge base for future research in the field and further development of empirical research.

410,Handling Heavy Metal Waste Through Utilization Of  Lapindo Activated Mud Hcl To Realize Environmentally,"until now, one of the industrial problems (metallurgy, electroplating, electrical equipment, paint, pesticides and jewelry) is heavy metal waste. some heavy metals that can cause adverse effects on the environment are chrome (cr), lead (pb), and mercury (hg). if the dangerous heavy metal is wasted into the environment, it can cause various problems in the environment and especially can threaten human life. disorders caused include lumps, tumors, nerve damage, brain damage, and even death. therefore, it is necessary to handle industrial waste before being disposed of into the environment to eliminate the content of cr, pb, and hg, so that industrial waste is no longer dangerous for humans or the environment. meanwhile, in indonesia since 2004 there was an event of natural disasters, namely the lapindo mudflow. lapindo mud is a mud produced from a burst of volcanic activity with a volume of 5000 m3/day. this mud has great potential as a heavy metal adsorbent, because it contains polysilic minerals. polysilic minerals when activated with strong acids such as hcl can produce polysilanol. polysilanol is one of the most effective adsorbents for heavy metal ions. the purpose of this study was to determine the effect of concentration of activator (hcl) on the content of heavy metals cr, pb, and hg produced from the industrial processes. the activation of lapindo mud with hcl causes impurities in the mineral component to be decomposed and dissolved with the activator, leaving a lot of pore in the mud. increasing the number of pores causes the surface area of the touch field of mud which has an active group of silanol. this results in a greater and more effective absorption of heavy metal ions. heavy metal ions will be trapped in the pores of the mud which have many active silanol groups. the more silica found on the surface of the touch field, the more heavy metals can be absorbed during the adsorption process. in this study a sem test was carried out to ensure the surface morphology of the sludge was successfully activated. in addition, in this study a quantitative test was conducted using aas to determine the effect of hcl concentration on adsorption of heavy metals cr, pb, and hg by activated sludge. based on the results of the study, it was found that the mud had been activated as evidenced by the emergence of many pores in the mud. the pore diameter produced is classified into the mesopore type between 0.2 to 2.5 µm. mesopori is a type of pore that is best at absorbing heavy metals. the other results obtained that the greater the concentration of hcl activator, the greater the binding capacity of the sludge to heavy metals. according to the results of this study, the best hcl concentration as a lapindo mud activator is 0.4 m, because the activated sludge with this treatment has the best ability to absorb heavy metals cr, pb, and hg up to 100%.","adsorption, activated sludge, hcl, heavy metals",,"friendly industries sigit trimayanto and sari edi cahyaningrum department of chemistry state university of surabaya surabaya, 60231, indonesia sigittrimayanto@mhs.unesa.ac.id, saricahya@yahoo.com",
411,Supply China Finance With Applications Of Block Chain  Kin Keung Lai,"it is important to understand the ecosystem of the supply chain for companies that work with suppliers all over the world. the health of a global supply chain isn’t just measured by revenue and profit. a more relevant indicator is how efficiently capital flows between buyers and suppliers. slow moving capital, much like slow moving inventory, creates unnecessary costs and inefficiencies in a supply chain. to operate the company more effectively, supply chain finance requires an ecosystem that improves the velocity of working capital across a supply chain. participants of the system involves buyers, suppliers, funding providers and platform providers. the purposes of this presentations is to introduce the concept of supply chain finance in particular with the applications of block chain. the background of block chain is also introduced. a listed company in hong kong is used as an illustrated case. biography professor lai received his phd at michigan state university, usa. he is an honorary professor at the department of industrial and manufacturing systems engineering, university of hong kong, hong kong. prior to his post, he was the chair professor of management science at the city university of hong kong. before his academic appointment, he was a senior operational research analyst for cathay pacific airways and an area manager on marketing information systems for union carbide eastern. professor lai’s main areas of research interests are operations and supply chain management, financial and business risk analysis and modeling using computational intelligence. he is the founding chairman of the hong kong operational research society of hong kong and currently the president of the asia association on risk and crises management. in 2009, professor lai was the recipient of the joon s. moon distinguished international alumni award of the michigan state university and also appointed as the chang jiang scholar chair professor by the ministry of education, china. in 2013, he has been selected as fellow of the asia pacific association of industrial engineering and management systems. in 2014, he was the recipient of the civil and environmental engineering distinguished alumni award, michigan state university, usa. in 2017, professor lai is elected as the academician of the international academy of systems and cybernetic sciences of austria. 3523",,,"international business school shaanxi normal university, xian, china",

413,Life Cycle Assessment In Ceramic Floor Tile Industry In  Sri Lanka,"tiles industry is the prime ceramic product which widely uses in sri lanka. wall tiles, floor tiles, and roof tiles are the major products of tile industry outlet. in sri lankan building construction applications, ceramic floor tiles show a significant contribution when compared with other floor development materials. the present world is more concerned about environmental awareness with continuous growth unsustainable manufacturing practices. therefore, many manufacturers are trying to create more and more eco-friendly processes and products by minimizing the effects of their activities on the environment. although, as a developing country, the environmental performance of the tiles manufacturing sector and improvement of the product quality and performance are key factors to improve the sustainability. in order to go for a green future, it is needed to identify the environmental hotspots generates by the manufacturing sector. the product life cycle assessment (lca) is an effective tool in the identification of environmental hotspots. in addition to that, it is required to model different life cycle scenarios for the improvement of life cycle management (lcm). therefore, this research focuses on conducting lca towards eco-design in floor tile industry by using scenario analysis. through this study, local floor tile industry can be driven to improve its overall sustainability of the floor tile manufacturing sector.",energy usages,"Global warming is the biggest threat to the world in this current period. This is due to the illegitimate manufacturing practices and enterprises as well as excessive resources and energy utilities. Therefore, such a comprehensive LCA can bring hidden environmental hotspot to the surface which is acting as a major role in environmental impact. In that respect, the environmental hotspot was identified through this study by referring ISO 14040 and 14044 principles which provide a guideline for LCA. According to the IPCC GWP impact assessment method, the firing process was identified as the environmental hotspot which is discharging high amount of emission (5.86 kg CO2eq) among the ceramic floor tile processes because the LP gas combustion processes rapidly increase the level of GHG emissions in the atmosphere and cause global warming and climate changes. As well as, when concentrating on the ReCiPe impact method, firing process acts as a major contributor to the environmental impact in all three endpoint impact categories such as resource, ecosystem and human health. Particularly, the resource category is affected significantly by the firing process among these three categories. Furthermore, the scenario analysis shows that the firing process discharges a significant amount of impact (0.06 kg CO2eq) and overall factory emits 0.142 kg CO2eq to the environment from the production of 1 m2 floor tile by an increment of 1% of error in input. Therefore, it shows that a small amount of input reduction can also be avoided the environmental impact significantly. On the other hand, a minor error in the LCI may direct to identify incorrect environmental hotspot. Therefore, the accuracy and reliability of LCI is very essential. In such cases, the parametric modeling would be the best solution to compare the performance when making changes in the product or process frequently and it is very beneficial to identify the eco-design possibilities during the design stage. In essence, it is evident from this entire life cycle impact assessment results that the firing process is the stringent hotspot to the environment. Therefore, in order to enhance the sustainability of Sri Lankan ceramic floor tile industry, it is essential to ensure the eco-design possibility to the firing process as it causes serious problems towards the green world.","s. kamalakkannan, r.l. peiris and a.k. kulatunga department of manufacturing & industrial engineering faculty of engineering university of peradeniya siva.kamalakkannan@gmail.com, rajithalakshanpeiris@gmail.com, aselakk@pdn.ac.lk",
414,Understanding Outsourcing From The Client’S Perspective:  Revisiting The Existing Literature,"with the advent of globalisation and fierce competition, outsourcing is considered as a smart management technique and a strategic initiative, which enables organisations to achieve competitive advantage in today’s market. accordingly, most of the organisations from both private and public sectors have tended to outsource at least one of their services to outside service providers. over the years, a number of researchers have discussed themes of outsourcing in different perspectives, and the aim of this paper is to synthesize the existing literature in order to provide a clearer picture of the outsourcing concept. though outsourcing has been written extensively, as the researchers highlighted, most of the previous studies have focused on two key questions: ‘‘should we outsource?’’ and ‘‘what to outsource?’’. therefore, this paper goes beyond what is often addressed in literature and discusses different definitions of outsourcing, the notions identified through those definitions, different forms of outsourcing, motives as well as the outsourcing process. while outsourcing involves two major parties, i.e. the client; who obtains a specific product, service or a process and the service provider; who provides the said product, service or process, this paper discusses the above key themes from the client’s point of view.",2018,,damitha rajini faculty of graduate studies university of colombo sri lanka damithar@uom.lk k.a.s.p. kaluarachchi department of management and organisation studies university of colombo sri lanka samanthakaluarachchi@yahoo.com,"References

415,Predicting Online Search Intention For  Validating Product Halalness Status,"the assessment institute for foods, drugs, and cosmetics indonesian council of ulama (lppom-mui) has provided web-based information to help consumers to trace the validity of halal status on the product package. this research aims to examine and predict muslim consumers’ intention to use the online search service to seek information regarding the halalness status of products. a research framework is created based on the technology acceptance model (tam) and modified by adding one external variable, namely halal concern. structural equation model (sem) is applied to assess the model fit and to test the research hypotheses. the result of model fit assessment concluded that the proposed model is marginally acceptable. the estimated model, however, found support only for the role of perceived ease of use (peu) in affecting perceived usefulness (pu). other hypotheses got weakly support since the relationships were in the predicted direction but not statistically significant. a little less than half (r2 = 0,486) of the variability in the online search intention is explained. this research is the first attempt to analyze the online information search intention regarding halal product status using tam. this study provides new information in the emerging context of validating product halalness status.","halalness, et al.","The objective of this research is to examine and predict Muslim consumers’ intention to use LPPOM-MUI website to seek information regarding the halalness status of products based on TAM. TAM can be used as a framework for predicting Muslim consumers’ intention to use online search service although based on a review of the three types of fit measures, the proposed model only got a marginally acceptable fit. The result of hypotheses testing shows that among five hypotheses proposed, only one hypothesis, stating that perceived ease of use affects perceive usefulness, got strongly support. While other hypotheses were weakly supported because the relationships were in the predicted direction but not statistically significant. Another finding of this result is about coefficient of determinant in which variable of halal concern together with variable of perceived ease of use could explain 84.5% of the variance in the perceived usefulness, whereas variables of halal concern, perceived ease of use, and perceived usefulness together are only able to explain variable of intention to use by 48.6%. This research has theoretical and practical contributions. Theoretically, this research becomes the first attempt to analyze the intention to use online search service regarding halal product status using TAM and then extended the original TAM by adding one external variable, namely halal concern. This research also has developed measurements model regarding the intention to use online search service in validating product halalness status. This measurement model can be used in other similar research focusing on user intention to use halal tracing technology. This research finding increases the importance placed on “easy-to-use” of online search service being available to Muslim consumers. Therefore, it is expected that the government of Indonesia through LPPOM-MUI can provide similar services but easier to use ones in order to provide halalness guarantee toward Muslim consumers.","ida giyanti and erni suparti industrial engineering study program universitas setia budi surakarta, indonesia idagiyanti@setiabudi.ac.id; erni.suparti@setiabudi.ac.id wahyudi sutopo research group of industrial engineering and techno-economics department of industrial engineering universitas sebelas maret wahyudisutopo@staff.uns.ac.id",

For the development, a benchmarking study is conducted. From the benchmarking study, there are eight subsystems in PPBT development system in PIT UNS. They are tenant candidate registration/collection, tenant candidate selection, technology transfer training, certification, and IP protection, monitoring and evaluation, funding, partnership, and exit strategy. By those processes, the UNS academician attached with the technology and their business idea will be transformed into technology-based startup or PPBT as the main output. But the system should be supported with the qualified resource in UNS. The system has been validated by FGD and pre-implemented by using two recent tenants of PIT UNS as the case study. Feedback from the tenant’s state that the system is able to help tenant identifying the recent incubation position and make the action plan. But it is necessary to explore the mentoring and coaching activity more deeply. As the future research direction, the system can be developed more deeply for each activity. Challenge to create qualified input source and environment in developing technology-based startup can be an alternative for future research.

The results of this study indicate that work safety has a relatively lower effect than work stress. On the one hand, this illustrates that OSH conditions in Indonesia are still relatively weak. Future research is needed to explore how much management commitment in day-to-day operations. This commitment illustrates how big the top management is to create work safety. Is there regular training? How big is the budget prepared? Do employees comply with the SOP?

419,Internal Vs External Green Supply Chain Management At  Petrochemical Industry Economic Performance In Indonesia,"indonesia's petrochemical sector contributes to 3% of indonesia gdp and its demand should soon grow by 5% per year due to indonesia's economic expansion. this is correlated with the economic expansion of indonesia, since petrochemical derivative products are utilized in the production process of plastic products, pharmaceuticals, and textile. the indonesia government put high effort on the integrated petrochemical industry development toward green industry in order to achieve better economic performance. the overall objective of this study is to draw the relationship between internal green supply chain management (gscm) and external gscm practices on economic performance of petrochemical industry in indonesia. internal gscm consist of eco design and internal environment management. whilst external gscm consist of green purchasing and reverse logistic. this study was conducted among petrochemical olefin manufactures based in banten province indonesia. the result showed that internal gscm has no direct effect on economic performance, but external gscm has a positive effect on economic performance. the external gscm practice implementation not only reduce any cost from waste treatment, environment accidents, and energy consumption toward profit achievement as well as profit growth over the years, but also generate sales and earnings.",petrochemical,"In summary, petrochemical industry in Indonesia is has a tendency toward fulfillment the green supply chain management application. Although, the petrochemical industry in Indonesia indicates that only the external GSCM practices affect the economic performance. An earlier study of economic performance revealed that out of the four GSCM practices, only green purchasing was found to have a significant impact on economic performance (Younis, 2016). On the other side, eco-design, which failed to impact any of corporate performance dimensions. Hence, economic performance considerations should be taken into account in the petrochemical industry, considering the scarcity of natural resources and importance of this industry in development in one hand and environmental damage caused by this industry on the other hand. Some indicators for economic performance might be used for the benchmark based on this study can be started on the successful of any new product launches as the impact of GSCM practices implementation subject to the green product or green production process. The external GSCM practice implementation could generate sales and earning toward profit achievement as well as profit growth over the years. Because, it might impact customer satisfaction toward their loyalty to the firms.

In order to achieve this objective, the engineering courses should be developed as per pedagogic framework, where the course is designed in modular fashion and which is further discretized in small units. The outcome based instructional objectives are set in terms of the pedagogic structure, at course, module and unit level with a strong correlation between these at all level. In the present work, a course Energy Technology has been developed as per the pedagogic framework and has been tested using a Shikshan software tool. It has been observed that from a pedagogic perspective and cognitive level context, there is a near to perfect correlation between course, and module level. At the same time, there is a very good correlation between module and unit level as well. The present and future educational needs command that courses for an engineering degree programme must encourage higher levels of cognitive learning. Thus it is essential to select instructional objectives with major emphasis on the higher level of cognitive skills such as the ability to analyze, synthesize and evaluate problems and present solutions. Higher cognitive levels were attained at the course and module level in this example course presented. However, at unit level, certain portion at lower cognitive level ushers deeper understanding of the course. In the present era of information technology, the self and quick learning is the mantra.

434,Design And Development Of Game Based Evaluation And  Learning (Gabel) For Applied Thermodynamics Course For,"this article describes the application of game based evaluation and learning in the classroom for formative assessment. the author caters large class of 194 second year students in applied thermodynamics course and evidence showed that this game enhances students’ attendance and learning in the course. the students got motivated to learn the course as it is active learning which much better as compared to the regular rote learning. the amalgamation of gamification as part of evaluation tasks is a complex process in active learning. it takes into attention not only the surrounding or motivational aspects of the activity, but also the quality criteria that are compulsory from the evaluation perspective. in the course, the stock market game was designed and customized for the active learning and evaluation in a structured fashion. in order to assess the effectiveness of it a survey was conducted. this activity received accolade from the students.","game based learning, student engagement","The biggest problem that teachers face in Engineering education is keeping students interested and motivated in their studies. For this 21st century generation traditional teaching method is not sufficient to keep them engaged and motivated to learn course. So GABEL is an effective tool to make students interested in attending the class and also stimulate them to learn. Exam fear is one of the biggest cause of depression amongst the students, with GABEL being tension free and stress busting evaluation and learning system, it has helped students to reduce their exam related anxiety and simultaneously helped them to improve their learning. Also it has facilitated them in quick learning which is much better than rote learning. So, GABEL is one of the strong tool for active and quick learning amongst the students.","active learning manoj kumar soni and tamali bhattacharya birla institute of technology and science (bits), pilani, india mssoni@pilani.bits-pilani.ac.in , tamali@pilani.bits-pilani.ac.in",
435,Women'S Leadership Policy Strategy: Improving Quality Of  Education (Tqm) In Higher Education,"the main problem is how strategies improve the quality of education in higher education: 1) understanding of the reality of the program, the quality of the program and the factors that influence it. in improving the quality of education, there must be sustainability of performance (functioning as a measure to address the problems of low quality education that relies on conventional approaches) and improving quality (directing higher education institutions to learn and implement total quality management) that is integrated with each quality management level of management and all units in the organizational system that aim to provide satisfactory services to customers, so they must optimize management to improve quality. the approach used is qualitative: (1) students are satisfied with services; (2) the service to its students; (3) to have high quality and meet the expectation; (4) the services of higher education: division of labor, relationships and communication between leaders, employees, salary / honor received and service. one of flourish base qualification is integrated qualify management (iqm) and needs the character change of the one who is the leader and the one who does work; the command from the leader changed by the worker into the initiative. the result can be concluded as follows 1) the understanding of stakeholders in the reality of study programs and factors influencing; 2) the quality of education process relatively customer satisfaction fulfillment key words: leadership policy. quality of education, tqm, higher education, iqm 3657",,"and Recomendation From the descriptive study in general it can be concluded that the level of education quality, leadership and quality of education are in good condition, this becomes the basis for efforts to plan and assess the quality or quality of education at PT. Improving the quality of education will be carried out well with the planning and evaluation of various management activities that have been carried out in a certain period of time, both in the management of higher education management and the learning process and management of human resources. The quality of human resources, especially lecturers as leaders in the learning process activities is needed as a basis for efforts to improve and improve the learning process, the quality and quality of an educator will be seen in the achievement of the management of learning activities and student achievement PT. PT leadership has an important role in the management of quality universities, leaders in carrying out leadership that is not good and unprofessional, will give a bad influence on the achievement of quality education in higher education, this is due to all policies in managing PT management lies with the leadership, so that the existence of good leadership will be the foundation in achieving the quality of education itself, in an effort to achieve that a leader needs the ability and quality in managing, guiding, fostering and directing every element of the PT in achieving educational goals. Based on the results of the research and conclusions as stated above, the following suggestions are conveyed; Leaders in the management of PT resources need appropriate leadership tailored to the needs and circumstances that exist within the scope of the PT by evaluating and appropriately evaluating various activities that have been carried out, a leader being in an educational institution especially PT, so that the right leadership can provide motivation and strong indication of the management and implementation of quality learning activities at PT, for that the leader must improve self-quality and improve leadership professionalism, and understand and have the ability to carry out leadership in efforts to achieve educational goals, be more sensitive and care for every problem and activities that take place, with the hope of directly addressing any shifts or disputes that arise, in order to maintain the process of improving the quality of education of PT. Higher Education is a system, namely a structure consisting of various components that are closely related to each other functionally, so that it is synergistic integration. In these components there are processes that are in accordance with their respective functions, but not exclusively or individually, but are interrelated, mutually supportive, and influence each other (Tampubolon, 2001: 79). The right quality management system needs to be developed. Ministry of National Education (2003) explains Higher Education in higher education is declared quality or quality, if: 1. The university is able to establish and realize its vision through the implementation of its mission (deductive aspect); 2. The college is able to meet the needs of stakeholders (inductive aspects), in the form of: (a). Community needs (societal needs); (b) The needs of the workforce (industrial needs); Professional needs.

437,Control Returnability Inventory Using System Dynamic  Modeling And Fuzzy Logic,"currently, most of the companies manage inventory in a traditional supply chain approach. but due to the company’s policies in return services and remanufacturing processes, a traditional supply chain is not really effective. the importance on working on inventory control is because of the difficulty of having a stable inventory control due to bullwhip effect which reduces the performance of supply chain. there is now close loop supply chain (clsc) use for the benefit of companies as it is very effective in reverse logistic flow. this effects the collection and distribution planning, inventory control, and production planning which reduces the effect in returnability which will increase the performance of the company. this project focuses on inventory control. this work successfully develops system dynamic (sd) model of the system for returns, using close loop diagrams, to have effective management of inventory control and remanufacturing and/or production planning. fuzzy logic is used in the model analysis to optimize inventory control and reduce the bullwhip effect in the real-world. this fuzzy decision makes the system less uncertain and creates lower bullwhip effect.","returnability, bullwhip effect, fuzzy logic 3698","In the production and remanufacturing and its inventory there are some important factors a manager must identify. This paper has used some important factors that cause impacts in the inventory, thus cause production and remanufacturing changes. With the help of the SD model, the study was able to not only recognize the control strategies in the system of remanufacturing, but also improve the whole system related to returns and within closed loop supply chain. The model is mainly based on electronic consumer industries where the variables and factors are quite similar in returns, including the inventories for remanufacturing and production run. Therefore, the model could work on many electronic consumer-based companies where managers could understand the impact of the variables and therefore could compare the models, and simulate them with real world. However, this model is also usable for other manufacturing industries that are not related to electronic, but changes could be done on their variables and relationships. This SD Model could be added for further research where it can be integrated with other factors such as capacity and facilities planning, information sharing, supply chain management, etc. These additional combined models will give bigger scope for bigger closed loop supply chain. However, other endogenous, exogenous and excluded variables should be included where different assumptions could be used.

Moreover, TQM has the ability to maintain all business functions according to target customers, which is the key to achieve sustainable competitive advantage (El Shenawy et al. 2007). This study has further confirmed and validated the research conclusion of statistically significant relationship between IQEM, and operational and environmental performance of food processing SMEs in Pakistan. In general, the result provides further support for the assertion of the RBV, and theory confirming the positive influence. Hence, leadership, employee management, strategic planning, process management and supplier management found to be the critical factors, and had an impact on firm’s overall performance. By practicing these factors food players can get a competitive advantage and improve their SMEs operational and environmental performance and expand their trade with rest of the world and get maximum benefits.","performances in food processing smes jamaludin k.r., hayati habibah abdul talib & syed ali raza shah razak faculty of technology and informatics, universiti teknologi malaysia, jalan sultan yahya petra, 54100 kuala lumpur, malaysia khairur.kl@utm.my, hayati@utm.my, razadopasi@gmail.com",

Two variables were ranked to have more influence on excavation hazard based on the mean, but three variables were found to have very high impact (VHI). Two of such variables (the extent of excavation depth and nature of the strata happened to have both influence and impact on excavation hazard. This indicates how dangerous these variables pose to employees during excavation. Emphasis should be placed on these variables and any other variable found to pose serious danger to employees. It was observed that few of the construction regulations were observed by employees. While most of the OHSA requirements were obeyed by employees. All hazards identified should be carefully analyzed and appropriate measures put in place to minimize or prevent serious accident on site. Planning for excavation hazard should be well executed and prompt action taken when due. Further studies should be conducted using a different method to ascertain the extent of accident and cost incurred in relation to excavation hazard on employees.","wellington didi thwala sustainable human settlement and construction research centre, department of construction management & quantity surveying, university of johannesburg, doornfontein campus, johannesburg, 2028, south africa. zakari mustapha school of engineering, department of building technology, cape coast technical university, cape coast, ghana. zakari.mustapha1967@gmail.com clinton aigbavbao sustainable human settlement and construction research centre, department of construction management & quantity surveying, university of johannesburg, doornfontein campus, johannesburg, 2028, south africa.",

449,Ethical Leaderships And Organizational Culture Of Student  Organization At Indonesian Private University,"this study aims to determine the effect of the ethical leaderships toward organizational culture at himpunan mahasiswa (student organization) of business administration on faculty of communication and business at telkom university or known as ‘hima adbis’. this research uses quantitative method with the types of data required are the combination between primary and secondary data. this research uses saturation sampling method with 52 respondents consisting of all organizers of hima adbis, and simple linear regression analysis for data analyzing. the results showed that ethical leadership is in the position of 84,08% with a number of very high category and organizational culture in the position of 86,27% with a number of very high category. the result of partially showed that ethical leadership influence organizational culture amounted to 22,5% and from other variables amounted 77,5% are not researched in this research. 70",,"Based on the results of the research which has been described about the effect of Ethical Leadership toward organizational culture of HIMA ADBIS, the conclusion can be obtained as follows: Ethical Leadership at Leader of HIMA ADBIS in the eyes of the respondent as a whole is in a category of very good. Organizational culture in HIMA ADBIS overall into the very good category. Ethical leadership Variable has an influence toward organizational culture of HIMA ADBIS. The magnitude of the influence of ethical leadership for the culture of the Organization was of 22.5% while the rest is influenced by other factors not examined in this study. Based on the conclusion that has been described above, the researcher can give some suggestion that would be useful for HIMA ADBIS that is based on the results of the research, self-control indicators that get the lowest score but fall into the good category is ""Leaders have the power to resist temptation and self-satisfaction"". It is suggested that the leader can further increase his sense of dissatisfaction of an achievement so that the organization and the leader itself can make improvement towards the better. For example, by doing fault evaluations in the execution of tasks and applying them to subsequent task work, listen more to critics and suggestions from set organizers and members of the set for improvement, and create new strategies to improve performance as well as expected achievement. It is expected that leaders can improve organizational culture in terms of the giving of the direction and clear communication as well as detailed in analyzing the work to organizer did not occur a misunderstanding to interpret the message and ambiguity in following SOP. These things can be overcome e.g. by means of more outlines the intent, purpose and how to complete tasks that must be done, explain organizer SOP in more detail, as well as frequently performing communication between leader and organizer intensively, mutual listening and mutual understanding of the circumstances in order to create a continuity so there is no longer a wrong perception. It is also important in creating value the culture of the Organization and reinforces the significance of the tagline ""kita, keluarga, jaya bersama"" (we are family, together toward glory) in the basic principle so that there is a solid foundation for the organization.","alini gilang telkom university jalan terusan buah batu bandung, 40257, indonesia alinigilang@telkomuniversity.ac.id mahendra fakhri telkom university jalan terusan buah batu bandung, 40257, indonesia mahendrafakhri@telkomuniversity.ac.id syarifuddin syarifuddin telkom university jalan terusan buah batu bandung, 40257, indonesia syarifuddin@telkomuniversity.ac.id mahir pradana telkom university jalan terusan buah batu bandung, 40257, indonesia mahirpradana@telkomuniversity.ac.id dita puri utami telkom university jalan terusan buah batu bandung, 40257, indonesia dutamii@telkomuniversity.ac.id",

451,The Application Of Lean Manufacturing To Reduce  Setup Time Of A Printing Process,"in today’s highly competitive world, industries are forced to find ways to survive by increasing efficiency and reducing costs. as one of several industries that are facing the challenges, the printing industry is threatened by competitions both among companies in the industry and technological threats like multimedia, e-books, etc., leading to the reduction in sales prices, higher competitions, and lower demands. this accentuates the need for companies to cut costs and improve productivity. the concept of lean manufacturing revolves around reducing wastes. reduction of wastes can lead to significant increase in productivity and reduction in costs. thus, lean manufacturing is one of the techniques that can potentially be applied to provide means for companies in the industry to survive. this research studies the analysis of setup time reduction of a printing process using a lean concept called single minute exchange of die (smed). main strategy for smed involves identifying setup activities, trying to convert the internal activities to external activities, and reducing activity times. the analyses of setup activities are conducted and a methodology to reduce standard setup time is presented. although data used in this research pertain to the company used as a case study, the approach can be applied to a printing process in general.","lean production, lean manufacturing","This paper has analyzed the setup of a printing process for book production and applied SMED, a technique in lean manufacturing, to reduce or improve the setup time. The analysis of setup operations has led to the possibility of separating the activities into internal and external activities. Further analysis has been performed to provide ways to reduce the setup time by changing plausible activities from internal to external and by shortening some internal activity time by performing one activity simultaneously with other internal activities. This research provides solutions that can be implemented which results in an increase production capacity by 25.27% on average lot size provided in the assumption of the results section. In practice, however, the success of the implementation depends on several other managerial issues and factors, such as motivation, operators’ mind sets, and several other factors. This issue has been addressed by previous research works including Lodgaard et al. (2016), AlManei et al. (2017), and Moeuf et al. (2016) and is not the focus of this research. Further extension of this research may include a case study of real implementation, a more thorough study of the impact of setup time reduction on the financial performance, success factors involved in implementing the results, and further attempts to reduce time used in internal and external activities. 8","kasarin chivatxaranukul aeronautic engineering, vincent mary school of engineering, assumption university, thailand kasarinch@gmail.com",

458,Mining Waste Management For Sustainable Mining  Practices,"the mining sector is one of the key economic drivers in southern africa. however, due to mining and minerals processing activities, huge amounts of waste are generated that have potential negative impacts to the environment. various wastes such as wastewater, particulate gases, overburden, waste rocks, tailings and slag are generated during the value addition of the ores. although there is potential for metal recovery and wastewater re-use from this waste generated it is critical that before a mining activity is done, an environmental impact assessment be done for sustainable mining activities.","environment, mining, waste management, in zimbabwe alone","As a way forward in mining waste management there is need for a waste management plan o for the pre- opening, operations and post closure of a mine so that mining becomes a sustainable and environmentally friendly industry.

460,A Quality Control-Based In-Process Artificial Neural   Network Surface Roughness Prediction System,"in-process surface roughness (ra) prediction systems for cnc machining incorporate quality control inspection while machining instead of performing inspection post-production. such systems generally consist of a sensing technology and a decision making model. data preprocessing is established as a necessary but often overlooked step in data analysis. using acoustic emission (ae) signals as a sensing technology and artificial neural network (ann) as a decision making model, the researchers were able to build and compare two ann models using input variables feed rate, frequency, and peak volume— an original unfiltered ann and a quality control-based filtered ann which uses an individual quality control chart as a data preprocess. based on a milling process dataset, results show that the qcbased ann model makes better, more accurate ra predictions, with a mean square error (mse) of 0.0214, compared to the original unfiltered ann, with an mse of 0.0189. these results prove the success of the qc-based in-process ann ra prediction system.","cnc machining, ae signals",". In the same sense, the modelling data is comprised of 200 and 189 data for the original ANN and QC-based ANN models respectively. This relatively larger dataset makes it more reliable to draw conclusions from. The existence of a significant difference between the two MSEs for the modelling data is enough to conclude the success of the proposed system; that is, that by comparison, the QC-based ANN model and its network LM- GDTANSIG-QC was able to yield more accurate Ra prediction values than the network LM-GD-TANSIG- ORIGINAL from the original ANN model. 5 Conclusion Two ANN models were built and compared – one original model and one quality control-based model. The difference is that the latter made use of an individual quality control chart to filter out Ra data that lie beyond the 3-sigma limits. Both models consist of modelling data and verification data. Following the experimental design that determines how many training parameter combinations to use, 168 combinations were tried. Both models yielded the lowest MSE using LM as the training function, GD as the learning function, and TANSIG as the transfer function. Ra predictions were simulated and compared for both networks. In both occasions, the MSE values decreased, which means the quality control-based ANN model yields more accurate Ra predictions than the original one. To further validate, a hypothesis test was performed. Although no significant difference was found between the MSE values of the verification data, the modelling data showed significant results. The success of the system may be attributed to the new behavior of the modelling data after the data preprocess done in building the QC-based ANN model. With new actual Ra values that do not go beyond the 3 sigma limits, the 189 Ra data lie closer to each other and were therefore more precise. After ANN simulation of the QC-based model, the simulated Ra values became more reliable in drawing predictions.","potsang b. huang department of industrial and systems engineering chung yuan christian university no. 200 zhongbei rd., zhongli dist., taoyuan city, taiwan 320 pthuang@cycu.edu.tw josephine d. german, rodalyn o. mabanag, and gabrielle quirino department of industrial engineering and service engineering management mapua institute of technology muralla st. intramuros, manila, metro manila 1002 jdgerman@mapua.edu.ph",
461,Time Estimation For Container Handling And  Yard Arrangement,"nowadays as economies rapidly have developed, the scale of trade and quantities of shipping goods have caused ship size to expand to size never previously seen. by august 2017, there were 60 mega- containerships with capacities over 18,000 teus. there were 165 those ships including ships with capacities over 14,000 teus. from the above, since the volume of maritime freight transport has increased so significantly, the liner shipping companies have also benefited from this containerization and mega-vessels era. in order to being fully effective on employing mega-containerships, at a terminal where mega-containerships are calling, most cargoes to be handled are transshipments from origin to destination ports via that terminal. thus, associated handling operations are undertaken between mega-containerships and feeder ships. in order to decrease the turnaround time of ships calling at this terminal, smooth handling of operations is of major importance. for such as the above terminal, there are the scheduling problems for ship-to-berth assignment in imai et al.(2007) and so on. in that study, it is given in advance that the handling time required from the ship berthing position to the container storage location in the yard. normally, the handling time spent for a ship is determined by the number of containers handled and the qc assigned to that ship. however, we consider the above scheduling problems at the terminal with long quay consisted of multiple-berth ranged in a line. thus we consider the model to estimate the handling time spent for the ship. additionally, this paper also considers the storage arrangement for transshipment containers which are unloaded from ships (as inbound) and are loaded to other ships (as outbound). due to the above issues, some situations can be considered as follows. since a large number of ships call at relevant terminals, a high workload will be needed at quay side operations unload and load to the relevant ships. this situation offers a great challenge to yard management. congestion in the yard area prolongs the time containers are handled and ships’ departure from the terminal may be delayed. this causes a backup of following ships that have to wait until the relevant ships’ departure. a domino effect occurs and will delay the ships calling to the next port. this is one of the bottleneck issues in the hub-and- spoke system. therefore, the efficiency of quay side operations at a container terminal depends on smooth and efficient handling operations at the yard side. using the estimated time of ship handling, our proposed approach that optimizes the yard arrangement along with the ship-to-berth assignment was applied in the genetic algorithm. the iterative approach, which first optimizes the ship-to-berth assignment and then optimizes the yard arrangement, is iterated. total service times obtained by the proposed approach were shorter than those done by the iterative one, in most cases under three average intervals of ship arrival. additionally, the cpu times spent by the proposed approach were less than those done by the iterative approach in all cases. therefore this paper’s contribution is, the proposed approach outperformed the existing iterative one in both the computational results and cpu times. 157",,,"etsuko nishimura graduate school of maritime sciences kobe university 5-1-1 fukae-minami, higashinada, kobe 658-0022, japan e-nisi@maritime.kobe-u.ac.jp",
462,A New Approach To Constructing Control Chart For  Inspecting Attribute Type Quality Parameters Under,"control charts graphically verify variation in quality parameters. attribute type control charts deal with quality parameters that can only hold two states e.g. good or bad, yes or no, etc. various control charts are developed based on the underlying distribution of the quality parameters, e.g., u and c-charts for poisson distribution, p and np-charts for binomial distribution, and also some non-parametric charts when the underlying distribution is uncertain. in construction of p-control chart using binomial distribution, the value of proportion non-conforming must be known or estimated from limited sample information. this may cause the control limits to shrink and often result in false detection when the process is actually in control. in this study, a statistical control chart is proposed based on hyperbinomial distribution when prior estimate of proportion non-conforming is unavailable and is estimated from limited sample information.",control chart,,"limited sample information shourav ahmed, gulam kibria, kais zaman department of industrial and production engineering bangladesh university of engineering and technology zahir raihan road, dhaka 1000, usa shourav2113@gmail.com, kibriaprangon@gmail.com, kaiszaman@yahoo.com",

Several parameters that affect precious metal leaching were identified and these were temperature, pulp density, thiosulphate concentration and ammonia concentration. For both Au and Ag leaching, the ratio of thiosulphate concentration to ammonia concentration should be between 0.5 and 1. That ratio has to be kept in that range if higher yields are to be realized. Lower pulp density of 25g/L yielded better results compared to a higher pulp density of 50g/L. This could be attributed to the fact the higher the amount of reagent per unit weight of PCBs the higher the yield. The effect of temperature is different on Au and Ag. For Au leaching, the optimum temperature was 400C and for Ag, the optimum temperature was 250C.","ignatio madanhire and liberty nyahunda department of mechanical engineering, university of zimbabwe, p.o box mp167, mount pleasant, harare, zimbabwe imadanhire@eng.uz.ac.zw simon chinguwa and charles mbohwa department of quality management and operations management, university of johannesburg, p. o. box 524, auckland park 2006, johannesburg, south africa. cmbohwa@uj.ac.za",

For locations off or away from the equator dual axis trackers may be handy for capturing maximum solar radiation. It is recommended that in future, one may consider the use of more efficient sensors, which are cost effective and consume little power for this application. This would further enhance efficiency. A solar panel that tracks the sun was designed and implemented. The required program that specified the various actions needed for the program to work was written. As a result, solar tracking was achieved. The system designed was a single tracker. While dual axis trackers are more efficient in tracking the sun, the additional circuitry and complexity was not required in this case. This is because Zimbabwe lies near the equator and therefore there are no significant changes in the apparent position of the sun during the various seasons. Dual axis trackers are more suitable in regions where there is a change in the position of the sun.","department of mechanical engineering, university of zimbabwe, p.o box mp167, mount pleasant, harare, zimbabwe imadanhire@eng.uz.ac.zw charles mbohwa ,department of quality management and operations management, university of johannesburg, p. o. box 524, auckland park 2006, johannesburg, south africa. cmbohwa@uj.ac.za",
468,A Risk Management Based Econometric Modelling Of  Insurance Underwriting In Engineering Projects,"pricing is very crucial for every underwriter in insurance industry. the premium rate set by an underwriter must obtain profit for the company considering that the insurance policy is at risk of numerous numbers of covered perils. also on this note, the price should be at the rate that motivates people to purchase the service. the depth of this research is how to update the current pricing of insurance for engineering projects that will benefit the insurance company. there are various models with various parameters considered for setting the premium rate of the insurance of engineering projects. these were examined to become more compatible on the insurance of engineering projects. the outcome shows that premium rate will increase from 5% to 15% of the existing rate. better insurers’ premium to loss ratio will be easily attained with this scenario. but on the side on the insured this is something that they would consider before getting the insurance. so, with this scenario the insurer should always be flexible to the wants of the insured and make the necessary adjustments for the benefit of the insured and insurer.","pricing, risk, premium, underwriter","This research provides an in depth analysis of a risk management based econometric modeling of insurance underwriting in engineering projects. The application of this model was only focused on two types of engineering insurance which are the Contractors All Risk (CAR) and Erection All Risk (EAR). These two have the same types of risk. It is just a matter of composition of which contract works were dominant between civil works and installation works. To test the data from the real world scenario, the study used the records of accounts of PMMSC. Different statistical tools were used to determine the relationship between the existing factors of the company, risk factors and econometric factors. The outcomes of the factors were all statistically significant using normality tests. This indicates that all the given data were normally distributed. During the correlation of variables between the premium production of CAR policy and EAR policy versus its claims, it was illustrated that the premium was not sufficient enough to pay the claims. As a result, the premium to loss ratio required by the PMMSC was not attained. These were shown on graph that as the claims were increased, the premium productions were decreased. Underwriting was the main reason for this occurrence. It means that there were factors that were not included on the premium rate evaluation.

469,Customer Visit Segmentation In An Online Retail Market  Partha Sarathi Mishra,"every customer has a unique intent at the back of his mind when shopping in a retail store. it could be monthly stocking, food for an outdoor party or for organizing a children’s picnic. being able to understand and predict the items a customer is likely to choose, depending on his intent, could help online retail companies to gain competitive advantage via targeted advertisements. the extant literature in this field mainly deals with customer segmentation and basket association for products. attempt to understand the intent of each customer visit is a relatively new area of study, which has been mainly restricted to physical retail stores. this study extends this idea for online retails, where data like customer views and add to carts are also available, allowing us to group each visit more effectively. we intend to identify the “shopping mission” behind every customer visit and hence we use the customer's interaction data with the products to group different visits via clustering. previous attempts at clustering have mostly focussed on using widely used clustering algorithms like the k-means clustering. however, we identify that this may not be the best suited method to exploit the binary matrix structure of the data. hence, we further propose the use of a better suited clustering method like the rank order clustering that makes use of this binary data structure. we have chosen the open source data from retail rocket, an online retail company, to validate our propositions.",clustering,,"department of industrial and systems engineering indian institute of technology kharagpur, 721302, west bengal, india parthamishra1996@gmail.com dr. jitendra kumar jha department of industrial and systems engineering indian institute of technology kharagpur, 721302, india jkjha@iem.iitkgp.ernet.in",
470,A Dual Approach To The Harmonized Model Between  Inventory Reduction And Heijyunka (Production Leveling),"a major issue in manufacturing is the low cost production and supply of products in response to variable demand while ensuring no sales opportunity is missed. in previous studies, many factors affecting production allocation, such as the number of workers and working hours, have been examined. in contrast, we have worked on the development of a new method to simply determine the production quantity “balanced (harmonized) between inventory reduction and heijyunka (production leveling),” based on the demand quantity and the inventory quantity. we have proposed a harmonized model of inventory reduction (lowering energy of inventory management) and production leveling (increasing entropy of production allocation) based on the “maximum entropy principle.” in this study, we attempt a “dual approach” to exchange the objective function and the constraint to the harmonized model and propose a new model based on the “minimum average-energy principle.” this enables multifaceted analysis of harmonized levels between production leveling and inventory reduction.",,"In this paper, we proposed a dual approach to the harmonized model between inventory reduction and production leveling (“heijyunka”) based on the minimum average-energy principle, and confirmed the validity of the proposed approach and model. By the proposed model, under the current production facilities and capabilities (given state of production leveling, that is, production allocation entropy associated with the smoothing coefficient), it will be possible to seek the optimal production quantity that minimizes the inventory management workload (energy) associated with inventory quantity. Also, multifaceted analysis on harmonized level between “heijyunka” and inventory reduction, including minimization of inventory management energy to maximization of production allocation entropy, will be possible. 211","based on the minimum average-energy principle tsuyoshi kurihara certified and accredited meteorologist hiroshima, japan tu3kurihara@gmail.com takaaki kawanaka institute for innovation in international engineering education, graduate school of engineering the university of tokyo 7-3-1 hongo, bunkyo-ku, tokyo, japan kawanaka@cce.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp hiroshi yamashita department of commerce, meiji university 1-1 kanda-surugadai, chiyoda-ku, tokyo, japan hyamas@meiji.ac.jp","References

474,An Employee Retention Model For Millennials In The  Philippine Telco Industry,"millennials in the workplace have the reputation of being job-hoppers to meet their perception of career improvement. while job-hopping may be a way to find better opportunities for these millennials, the turnover of employees in the workplace creates four different types of costs which is incurred by the company. this study aims to create a millennial employee retention model through examination of the millennial job satisfaction factors, management initiatives and the assessment of fit between the millennials and the management. the survey was participated by 318 millennial employees and the structured interview was responded by 7 companies in the philippine telco industry. chi-square tests and one-way anova were used to determine the relationships and the fit between the millennials and the management in terms of job satisfaction. results show a fit in all the job satisfaction factors which meant that the management is able to meet the job satisfaction of its millennial employees. among the eight job satisfaction factors, millennials were very satisfied with their relationship with peers/superiors. however, salary and benefits yielded an either satisfied or dissatisfied rating in the results. companies in the telco industry should implement incentive programs to improve the job satisfaction of the millennials in terms of salary and benefits. findings show that promotion and career planning, work-life balance and training/career development were the top three job satisfaction factors to retain millennials in the workplace.",job satisfaction,"Millennials in the workplace are an essential asset comprising the organization. Keeping these millennials satisfied in the workplace in terms of their job satisfaction factors is a key to retaining them in the workplace. Through the developed millennial retention model, companies can align their current programs and activities to the recommended programs of the retention model. Organizations will be able to retain millennials in the workplace by keeping them satisfied in the job they do and at the same time minimizing their turnover intention. Millennials in the Philippine Telco industry were very satisfied with their relationship with peers/superiors but were either satisfied or dissatisfied with their salary and benefits. Thus, only salary and benefits are the factors leading to millennial turnover in the workplace. Moreover, the telco companies in the Philippines were also able to meet the job satisfaction needs and preferences of these millennials which resulted to a satisfied millennial workforce in the industry in terms of all the examined job satisfaction factors.","john jerjie c. reyes and marvin i. norona school of industrial engineering and engineering management mapua university manila city, philippines johnjerjie_reyes@yahoo.com, minorona@mapua.edu.ph","references in the workplace indicating: (1)

475,Heuristic Approaches For Optimizing Multi-Echelon Multifacility Green Reverse Logistics Network Design,"in recent years, reverse logistics (rl) has received considerable attention due to business and environmental factors. the environmental context has driven many organizations to invest in green technologies, with a recent emphasis on reducing greenhouse gasses (ghg) emission. this research proposes a mixed integer linear programming model to a multi-echelon reverse logistics network design problem with multi-facility while taking account of ghg emissions. the proposed model aims at minimizing the total cost of an organization which mainly includes production, emission costs, and transportation cost and recovery cost. to consider variations in future in the network configuration; we incorporated the dynamic nature of the cost parameters. since such network design problems are np-hard problems, we proposed an enhanced benders decomposition algorithm to find the near optimal solution. we also compare the numerical results through exact solutions solved using ibm ilog cplex 12.5.","reverse logistics, carbon emissions, kharagpur",,"k nageswara reddy, akhilesh kumar department of industrial and systems engineering indian institute of technology, kharagpur west bengal, india, 721302 knreddy@iitkgp.ac.in, akumar@iem.iitkgp.ernet.in",
476,"Work-Related Psychosocial Factors Associated With Lower  Back Pain Among Male Handicraft Workers In Jaipur, India","handicraft occupation is a strenuous job, often performed in poor work settings. working in such conditions for a long period of time may lead to musculoskeletal pain in different body regions. the study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of lower back pain and their associated work-related psychosocial risk factors among the male handicraft workers in india. a self-reported questionnaire study was conducted among 286 male handicraft workers, including gemstone cutters, metalcraft workers, and miniature painters. the lower back pain was found to be the most prevalent (75.18%) and severe work-related health problem in this occupational group. work-related psychosocial factors such as high job demand and low job control showed a significant association with the development of lower back pain. the findings suggested that despite the substantial impact of the physical work with respect to the etiology of musculoskeletal pain, researchers should expand their focus to work-related psychosocial issues. preventive intervention strategies ensuring ergonomic workload and flexibility at the workplace of handicraft workers are highly recommended.","handicraft workers, lower back pain, ergonomics",,"dipayan das department of mechanical engineering malaviya national institute of technology jaipur jaipur, rajasthan 302017, india dipayandas03@gmail.com awadhesh kumar department of mechanical engineering malaviya national institute of technology jaipur jaipur, rajasthan 302017, india awdshkumar3@gmail.com monica sharma department of mechanical engineering malaviya national institute of technology jaipur jaipur, rajasthan 302017, india mncsharma18@gmail.com","References

The existing studies were reviewed and classified based on IE tool type, operational level, and system level, and case study. We found that the main IE tool that the researchers usually employ in the improvement of healthcare management in Thailand is a Lean concept. Not only Lean concept but also simulation, inventory control model, and ABC classification have been applied in this field as well. In operational level and system level, our literature survey found that most researchers published their works on the operation level in Thailand, while the works on the system level are few researches. In accordance with the case study of existing studies, most papers aimed to focus on a hospital in Thailand, especially public hospital. Also, we found that the drug department and outpatient department are the main department of research in Thailand. Finally, research gaps and future research were identified as assisting in developing future healthcare management.

478,Collision Probability Analysis In A Parallel Machines Model  When The Number Of Jobs Is Constrained,"when designing a production line, obtaining the maximum number of finished products in a given time is a fundamental requirement. to this end, the time interval for feeding materials into a line should be as short as possible. when time intervals are shortened, the probability of a collision occurring between materials increases. in a manufacturing process, such a collision might result in losses in many areas. for example, financial or time losses might be incurred if a manufacturing system shuts down. moreover, a shutdown might also increase labor costs due to the recovery required. therefore, when designing a manufacturing line, it can be very important to estimate the collision probability in the designed line. research already exists on collision probability in a manufacturing model, where an in-line machines model was assumed. this study assumes that the processing times of jobs follow an erlang distribution, and then derives a closed form formula for collision probability in a parallel machines model, where the number of jobs is the number of machines plus one or two. following on from this, we discuss whether collision probability in a parallel machines model could be described by a closed form expression for any number of jobs.",,,"taiki otsuka and eishi chiba department of industrial and systems engineering, hosei university, 3-7-2 kajino-cho, koganei-shi, tokyo, 184-8584 japan taiki.otsuka.98@hosei.ac.jp, e-chiba@hosei.ac.jp",

480,A Three Stage Dea Approach For Evaluating The  Performance Of Supply Chains: Case Study Of Public,"supply chain performance evaluation is a critical and difficult task in supply chain management. this paper presents a performance evaluation framework to evaluate and compare the performance of different supply chains. the framework is based on data envelopment analysis (dea) as a data oriented tool for evaluating the performance of several supply chains that convert multiple inputs to multiple outputs. the objectives of this study are: (a) to construct a set of aggregated indicators that best characterize the performance of supply chains (b) to estimate the relative technical, pure technical and scale efficiencies of supply chains and interpret the results, and finally (c) to estimate the magnitudes of input adjustments that would have been required to make each supply chain efficient. the proposed approach is then applied to evaluate real- life public pharmaceutical products supply chains in morocco.",,"The overarching objectives of this research are to propose a three stage DEA approach to aggregate and evaluate the performance of supply chains. The outcome of this study will assist the supply chains managers in comparing their supply chains against peers and dimensioning their resources to achieve a given level of productions. Data envelopment analysis is first used to aggregate a set of performance indicators into one composite indicator and then to measure the relative technical, pure technical and scale efficiencies of supply chains. Decomposing technical efficiency scores into pure technical efficiency and scale efficiency provides guidance on what can be achieved in the short and long term. The efficiency scores have been calculated under Constant Return to Scale (CRS) and Variable Return to Scale (VRS) with an input orientation which aims to reduce the amount of inputs for a given level of outputs. However, the proposed approach has a serious limitation as it produces the aggregated inputs targets and doesn’t allow the derivation of the original inputs targets. Thus, the process of decision making is difficult as managers can’t directly act on the aggregated indicators. Hence future researches are needed to overcome this shortcoming.

481,Sustainable Biodegradable Packaging Material:  A Solution For Decreasing Available Capacity,"plastic packaging material plays a vital role in people’s daily lives, and it is a fact that most of which are petroleum- based like the one being used in the philippines. this type of plastic is very strong, less brittle, but non-biodegradable that would take hundreds of years before it decays, which in turn decreases the available capacity of sanitary landfills. if this scenario continued, many of the sanitary landfills in the philippines will be forced to close as what the others have already been into. due to this concern, this research would introduce the use of a sustainable biodegradable packaging material which can be a substitute to the petroleum-based plastics. this research will identify various alternatives and choose among these alternatives through the application of multi-criteria decision making with consideration of valuable criteria in selecting a packaging material. the chosen alternative will then be subjected for demand and supply analysis to check the readiness of the philippines for the use of the chosen sustainable biodegradable packaging material, and check its eventual impact to the capacity of sanitary landfills.",sanitary landfill,,"of landfills in the philippines juan miguel n. dinglasan industrial engineering department technological institute of the philippines quezon city, philippines migdinglasan@gmail.com",

While the exact method cannot provide solution in a reasonable time, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is implemented to handling the complexity of the real-world problem. To solve the problem, the encoding and decoding procedures are developed for transform a particle solution into the routing of post box collection activity. Furthermore, several swap strategies are proposed to improve the solution quality. The experimental results show that the proposed PSO can effectively find the new post box collection routing which helps to reduce the total travelling time, the total travelling distance, and the total cost. In conclusion, the proposed PSO algorithm can be used as a smart decision making tool to solve similar vehicle routing problems.

485,Deepfork: Supervised Prediction Of Information Diffusion  In Github,"information spreads on complex social networks extremely fast. a piece of information can go viral in no time and can be harmful. often it is hard to stop this information spread causing social unrest. an intentional spread of software vulnerabilities in github has caused millions of dollars in losses. github is a social coding platform that enables a huge number of open source software projects to thrive. to better understand how the information spreads on github, we develop a deep neural network model: “deepfork”, a supervised machine learning based approach that aims to predict information diffusion; considering node as well as topological features in complex social networks. in our empirical studies, we observed that information diffusion can be detected by link prediction using supervised learning. this model investigates the followee-follower influence that underlay information dynamics in social coding platform. deepfork outperforms other machine learning models as it better learns the discriminative patterns from the input features. deepfork helps us in understand human influence on information spread and evolution.",link prediction,,"ramya akula1, niloofar yousefi2 and ivan garibay3 industrial engineering and management systems university of central florida orlando, usa ramya akula, niloofar yousefi, ivan garibay","References

488,A Study On A Routing Problem Focusing On Freight  Transportations,"we propose a routing model suited for freight transportation by mid- and large-size trucks. a digital road network data that includes non-arterial roads is used. passenger vehicles and lightweight trucks often run on non- arterial roads, because in many cases their destinations are residential districts. moreover, mid- and large-size trucks frequently work for deliveries from a factory to distribution stations. these stations are often located beside an arterial road. the latter type of transportation would cause air pollution, because trucks often idle on a street to wait for their scheduled time. to address this issue, we first reveal features of routing policy of mid- and large-size trucks. then, we solve a routing problem in which a penalty for left- and right-turns is taken into account. the penalty has the same characteristics as that of the route selection of mid- and large-size trucks. further, we implement a procedure for solving the constructed problem to work on a geographical information system. a simulation is conducted using a network data of both arterial and non-arterial roads in tokyo, japan. numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","routing problem, transportation",,"tatsuya komiya advanced course in production systems engineering salesian polytechnic machida tokyo 194-0215, japan s18603@salesio-sp.ac.jp yoichi shimakawa department of computer science and technology salesian polytechnic machida tokyo 194-0215, japan simakawa@salesio-sp.ac.jp hiroyuki goto department of industrial & system engineering hosei university tokyo, japan goto-h@hosei.ac.jp",

490,Risk Exposure And Factor Effect Study Of Selected Car  Accident Parameters On Accident Severity,"traffic accidents have been very costly to individuals and societies over long decades, motor vehicle collision may cause serious injuries or even deaths to drivers, passengers, or pedestrians. vehicle collision also causes car and property damage. however, there are some factors, which contribute more to the risk of car accidents that includes the vehicle itself, speeding, road conditions, and driver skills and behavior. in this work, a factor effect study using design of experiment tools has been performed to study the effect of some factors on the severity of car accidents in a city in the gulf area over a year. actual data was gathered and statistically analyzed, the factors considered in this study were basically; speeding, driver's skills and attention during driving, and driving under alcoholic condition besides studying the effect of using seatbelts on accident’s severity level. the effect of the main factors and the factor interaction was analyzed. the study has revealed that 80% of the accidents were caused by low attention and poor skills of drivers; it was also found that fastening seatbelts was very effective in reducing medium-severity accidents.","risk, severity, car accidents, factor effect","In this study, accident data were analyzed to understand the effect of some factors on the severity level of the accident as a part of the accident risk management process. Driver’s skills and attention, speeding, and driving under alcoholic conditions were considered in this study and the effect of the status of the seatbelt on the severity level was investigated. The majority (about 80%) of the moderate and low severe accidents were caused by the driver’s skills and attention. It was also found that the number of accidents resulting from some factors is affected by the levels of the other factors. For catastrophic accidents, the number of accidents observed over a year was not affected by the status of the seatbelt. Therefore, awareness campaigns are very helpful in urging drivers to pay more attention during driving.","khalid alzoubi department of industrial engineering jordan university of science and technology p.o. box 3030, irbid 22110, jordan kalzoubi@gmail.com sharaf alkheder department of civil engineering kuwait university p.o. box 5969, safat 13060, kuwait sharaf.alkehder@ku.edu.kw","references: The case of speeding of young car drivers, Accident Analysis and Prevention, vol. 97, pp. 315–325,
