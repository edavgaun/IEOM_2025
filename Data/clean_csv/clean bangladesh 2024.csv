We systematically investigated the impact of gelatin content on these composite scaffolds, revealing the intricate interplay between their chemical and mechanical properties. FTIR analysis confirmed the formation of strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds between PVA and gelatin, indicating a synergistic interaction within the scaffold structure. As gelatin content increased, the refractive index decreased, suggesting enhanced chemical integration, particularly with hydroxyl groups. This molecular-level interaction significantly influenced the scaffold’s microstructure and mechanical performance. The addition of gelatin initially boosted the PVA scaffold’s elasticity modulus, highlighting its potential for providing structural support. However, exceeding 12% gelatin content led to a decline in physicochemical performance. Our findings pinpoint PVA-12G as a promising candidate for tissue engineering due to its optimal balance of elasticity and elongation. Further refining this understanding and exploring the potential of these composite biomaterials lie at the forefront of our ongoing research. This study contributes valuable insights into composite scaffold mechanics and pioneers the development of advanced 3D bioprinting technologies. This paves the way for personalized and complex tissue engineering applications, opening doors to exciting possibilities in regenerative medicine.","performance analysis of gelatin/pva composite scaffolds by a customized 3d bioprinter khondoker safin kaosar saad, tasfia saba,kibria rahat, shahid uddin ahmed, adib bin rashid military institute of science and technology dhaka-1216, bangladesh safin.kaosar@gmail.com, tasfiasaba567@gmail.com,rahatkibria5@gmail.com, shahidshakib0@gmail.com,adib8809@gmail.com",

2,7Th Bangladesh Conference On Industrial Engineering And Operations Management  Doi: 10.46254/Ba07.20240007,"lean six sigma (lss) is a globally recognized methodology for process optimization and waste reduction, driving operational excellence in developed economies. however, its adoption in developing countries like bangladesh faces significant barriers, including resource constraints, cultural challenges, and limited awareness of process improvement techniques. this study examines the current state of lss implementation in bangladesh, identifies key challenges specific to resource-limited environments, and proposes a customized lss framework tailored to the industrial context of bangladesh. the research highlights several critical obstacles hindering successful lss adoption, including a lack of leadership commitment, insufficient training, and resistance to cultural change. furthermore, the study reveals that the low level of understanding and the absence of a systematic approach to process improvement contribute to the slow uptake of lss practices. to address these issues, the study proposes a comprehensive, context-sensitive lss framework that includes strategies for leadership engagement, capacity building, and fostering a culture of continuous improvement. the proposed framework emphasizes practical, cost-effective tools and techniques that can be implemented with limited resources, while also considering the cultural nuances that impact organizational change. by aligning lss principles with the specific needs and constraints of the bangladesh’s industrial environment, the framework offers a viable path for industries to enhance operational performance, reduce waste, and achieve sustainable growth. the findings provide valuable insights for policymakers, business leaders, and practitioners aiming to promote lss in developing countries.",lean six sigma,"To ensure efficient, effective, and consistent operations companies need to continuously invest in process improvement.(Lameijer et al. 2021). This study highlights the significant role of Lean Six Sigma (LSS) as a strategic framework for achieving business excellence across diverse industries. LSS is still an important context of strategic direction toward business excellence in various types of industries, this is what this study reflects. It allows organizations to combine millions of waste elimination and process variability reduction through Lean manufacturing and Six Sigma methodologies. What emerges from many case studies is that LSS is more than tools, and much about understanding processes and culture change. It all starts with aligning LSS initiatives with strategic business goals to make sure every project is in the main stream of the organization. This alignment creates a sense of purpose and guidance, allowing teams to direct their attention toward the areas that matter most. The paper proves the Lean Six Sigma as a holistic strategic solution of achieving business excellence through diverse industries. Lean Six Sigma blends the waste reduction of Lean with the data-driven quality management from Six Sigma to enable organizations to optimize processes and drive continuous improvement. Organizational framework linked to organizational goals, top management commitment, and in-depth training on combining the two, is the essence of successful implementation. Nevertheless, here, the challenges like availability of resources and reluctance to change must be taken into account. Organizations can only gain the full benefits of Lean Six Sigma when there is strategic alignment and cultural readiness to accept Lean Six Sigma.

3,7Th Bangladesh Conference On Industrial Engineering And Operations Management  Doi: 10.46254/Ba07.20240009,"over the past decade, integrating human factors and ergonomics (hfe) into healthcare has become crucial for improving the interactions between healthcare workers and their environments. the main goal is to enhance safety, efficiency, and overall well-being. while completely eliminating human factors in healthcare is challenging due to the complexity of tasks, their negative impact can be reduced through effective risk management and task optimization. this paper examines key hfe strategies, emphasizing the development of solutions to mitigate risk factors and implement comprehensive healthcare management systems. a major focus of these strategies is identifying high-risk jobs in healthcare that contribute to musculoskeletal disorders (msds) among workers. by prioritizing these roles and applying ergonomic improvements, the risk of msds can be significantly reduced, improving worker safety and job satisfaction. additionally, these strategies aim to prevent the future development of msds by embedding ergonomic principles into job design from the outset. implementing hfe strategies benefits both healthcare workers and patients. by fostering long-term partnerships, healthcare institutions can create an environment where safety is prioritized, worker well-being is enhanced, and cost-effectiveness is achieved. this holistic approach not only improves the quality of care but also strengthens the sustainability and resilience of the healthcare system. the paper advocates for a comprehensive approach to hfe, which addresses both immediate risks and long-term benefits, ensuring that healthcare environments are optimized for both workers’ health and patient safety.","healthcare, risk management","The following study underscores the importance of applying human factors and ergonomics principles to reduce musculoskeletal risks in healthcare settings. By addressing the high-risk tasks identified through the REBA tool and implementing targeted ergonomic interventions, healthcare organizations can significantly improve worker safety, reduce the prevalence of MSDs, and ultimately enhance the quality of patient care. Ongoing training and awareness programs will be essential to sustain these improvements and foster a culture of safety within healthcare environments. Improving efficiencies and patient safety in healthcare can be achieved by modeling how healthcare systems work while considering human factors and ergonomics. By predicting how individuals and the overall system will perform, we can enhance safety and satisfaction for everyone involved—clinicians, patients, pharmacists, and healthcare organizations. Human factors and ergonomics (HF/E) is concerned with the design of work and work systems. There is an increasing appreciation of the value that HF/E can bring to enhancing the quality and safety of care, but the professionalization of HF/E in healthcare is still in its infancy (Sujan et al. 2021). This study underscores the critical need to integrate Human Factors and Ergonomics (HFE) principles into healthcare systems to enhance both worker safety and patient care. By applying the DMAIC framework, we identified key ergonomic risks in healthcare tasks, providing a systematic approach to implement effective ergonomic improvements. The use of the REBA tool highlighted high-risk tasks, particularly patient handling and surgery postures, that contribute to musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) among healthcare workers. In adoption of a comprehensive, systematic approach to ergonomics in healthcare settings is essential for reducing MSDs and promoting a safer, more efficient work environment. The study demonstrates that addressing both the physical and cognitive aspects of ergonomics can lead to improved worker comfort, reduced turnover, and enhanced patient care quality.

In addition, it is concluded that productivity, Lead Time, percentage of material waste, and the Value Added Ratio are suitable indicators for measuring and comparing the company's performance before and after implementing the proposed improvements. The results of the initial evaluation indicated the underutilization of fabric, the presence of elements that hinder operations, scarce documentation, among others; concluding that the main problem of the company is the excessive amount of material and time waste, and the lack of initiative for its reduction, causing activities to be carried out at a much slower pace than required to meet market demand.By applying the proposal to a real system, it can be concluded that this method of verification provides much more precise and accurate information compared to a simulation with software and using historical data from the company as input. Subsequently, it is functionally validated that the application of Lean methods is successful, as evidenced by the optimization of performance indicators as well as the financial assessment of the investment.","supply chain management applying vsm, 5s and standardized work in an sme: a case study of an apparel manufacturing company piero alonso bonifaz riojas bachelor facultad de ingeniería y arquitectura, universidad de lima, perú 20180253@aloe.ulima.edu.pe https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1004-5053 fatima rivas chumpitaz bachelor facultad de ingeniería y arquitectura, universidad de lima, perú 20181618@aloe.ulima.edu.pe https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4671-6971 rafael chavez ugaz research professor facultad de ingeniería y arquitectura, universidad de lima, perú rchavezu@ulima.edu.pe https://orcid.org/ 0000-0002-9450-0158",

25,7Th Bangladesh Conference On Industrial Engineering And Operations Management  Doi: 10.46254/Ba07.20240040,"naca 4415 is the most common and studied airfoil in aerodynamic studies. incorporating flaps with naca 4415 airfoil is an effective way to improve aerodynamic performance and efficiency. this study presents a comparative numerical analysis among a standard model of naca 4415 airfoil, modified naca 4415 incorporating gurney flap, and naca 4415 airfoil incorporating bionic flap based on the coefficient of lift and coefficient of drag at various angles of attack (aoa) (i.e. -15°, -10°, -5°,0°,5°,10°,15°) and flap height of 2% of the chord length. the airfoil performance was evaluated under a constant upstream velocity of 20 m/s using computational fluid dynamics (cfd) simulations. the performance was measured based on lift coefficient over drag coefficient ratio and it is validated using velocity and pressure contour over the surface of the airfoil. the highest lift coefficient over drag coefficient ratio was found in the naca 4415 airfoil incorporating a gurney flap, then the standard naca 4415 airfoil and the least value of the ratio comes with the naca 4415 airfoil incorporating a bionic flap. for instance, the gurney flap made a big difference, boosting the lift-to-drag ratio by 49.9% at 0° aoa compared to the standard airfoil. conversely, the bionic flap reduced this ratio by 19.86%. however, in every case, naca 4415 airfoil with gurney flap outperforms than other two airfoils in this study. moreover, the velocity and pressure contour also support the result found from lift and drag coefficient.","cfd, bionic flap, gurney flap, rans","and Future Research The realizable 𝑘𝑘−𝜀𝜀 turbulent model was used in this study to analyze the aerodynamic performance of the NACA 4415 Airfoil and its modifications with Gurney and bionic flaps at various attack angles (-15°, -10°, -5°, 0°, 5°, 10°, and 15°). To find out how these changes influenced important aerodynamic characteristics such as the lift-to-drag ratio, velocity distribution, pressure distribution, and pressure coefficient, Ansys FLUENT was utilized. The NACA4415 airfoil with the Gurney flap has achieved the highest lift-to-drag ratio, increasing 49.9% above the conventional airfoil at 00 AOA. This demonstrates greater aerodynamic efficiency. In contrast, the bionic flap reduced the Cl/Cd ratio by 19.86% at the same angle of attack, indicating that it is less effective in applications that favor lift. The gurney flap exhibited low trailing edge separation, providing improved lift generation across all AOAs. NACA 4415 with a bionic flap has the lowest separation. It may be ideal for stability-focused designs, such as airplanes or UAVs, which require consistent performance in a variety of flying circumstances. The Gurney flap increased pressure at the trailing edge, which facilitated increasing lift by using trailing edges. In contrast, the bionic flap had a more uniform pressure distribution at negative AOAs, resulting in less lift. For both the bionic flap and the normal airfoil, lift was primarily produced at the leading edge. The pressure coefficient distribution of the NACA 4415 airfoil and with gurney and bionic flap designs varies significantly with angle of attack (AOA). Lower lift at negative AOAs is caused by negative pressure on the lower surface and positive pressure on the top surface. The lower surface is under higher pressure when there are positive AOAs, so they produce more lift. The pressure differential coefficient was also found to be substantially smaller at the trailing edge than it is at the leading edge, despite being substantially larger there.In conclusion, the modified NACA4415 airfoil with Gurney flaps exhibits remarkable aerodynamic performance, suggesting it is for application 295","aerodynamic performance analysis of naca 4415 airfoil incorporating gurney and bionic flap: a steady-state numerical analysis md zisanul haque bhuiyan graduate student research assistant, department of mechanical engineering, university of michigan – flint, mi, usa zisanul@umich.edu md. muqtadir fuad, masud rana, a. s. m. maruf hasan, khalid ammar undergraduate student, department of industrial and production engineering (ipe) bangladesh university of engineering & technology (buet), dhaka, bangladesh 2008079@ipe.buet.ac.bd, 1908046@ipe.buet.ac.bd, 2008036@ipe.buet.ac.bd, 2008089@ipe.buet.ac.bd","References

28,7Th Bangladesh Conference On Industrial Engineering And Operations Management  Doi: 10.46254/Ba07.20240045,"in the current unstable global economy, supply chain resilience (scr) is essential for ensuring business continuation during disruptions. this study aims to identify and prioritize barriers to supply chain resilience (scr) within the bangladeshi food industry, a sector that has traditionally had difficulties due to inadequate resilience frameworks. this research utilizes the fuzzy technique for order preference by similarity to the ideal solution (fuzzy topsis) to model the interrelationships among significant barriers, incorporating expert insights to provide a definitive hierarchy of barriers. the findings underscore the ""non-availability of a cross-multi-tasking workforce"" as the primary barrier, severely impacting the supply chain's flexibility and capacity to respond to disruptions. furthermore, barriers such as ""increased product stock time"" were identified as impactful, but to a lower degree. this study presents a strategy framework to tackle these difficulties and delivers practical insights to improve scr, especially in emerging markets such as bangladesh. these findings are significant for practitioners and policymakers, endorsing proactive initiatives to enhance scr and alleviate future risks.",fuzzy topsis,"This study aimed to identify and analyze the most significant variables affecting SCR through the application of the Fuzzy TOPSIS method. Utilizing the Fuzzy TOPSIS methodology, this study identified and ranked critical barriers according to their impact, providing a framework for prioritized action. This research uncovers critical insights into the factors influencing SCR and their relative importance. Hence the objective of this study is fulfilled. Although this study focuses on the Bangladeshi food industry, the findings have broader implications for supply chain resilience in emerging markets and beyond. The barriers identified—such as workforce limitations are not unique to Bangladesh but are common challenges faced by industries worldwide, especially in developing economies. The insights from this study can be applied to other sectors in Bangladesh, as well as in other emerging markets with similar supply chain vulnerabilities. Furthermore, the framework developed through this research applies to different industries and regions. By addressing workforce flexibility, supply chain collaboration, and logistical efficiency, businesses worldwide can enhance their resilience to disruptions, making the study's findings relevant across various contexts, including manufacturing, agriculture, and retail sectors globally. In conclusion, this study not only provides a deeper understanding of the barriers to SCR in the Bangladeshi food industry but also offers a foundation for future research that can extend these insights to other regions and industries. By taking a proactive approach to overcoming these barriers, organizations can build more resilient supply chains that are better equipped to withstand future disruptions. 6.1 Limitations and Future Work While this study offers important insights into the barriers to SCR, there are several avenues for future research. Advanced modeling techniques, such as Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) or Structural Equation Modeling (SEM), could be applied to further explore the complex interrelationships between barriers. These techniques could help clarify the causal relationships and cascading effects of various factors within the supply chain. For instance, SEM could reveal how specific barriers influence each other over time, helping to develop a dynamic model of SCR that accounts for both immediate and long-term disruptions. Moreover, future research could incorporate real-time data analytics and machine learning approaches to predict the impact of various disruptions on supply chains. These techniques would allow for a more data-driven understanding of how different barriers interact under changing 331","an analysis of barriers to supply chain resilience adoption in the bangladesh food industries: a fuzzy topsis approach ruhaniayth bin afsar, istiaqe ahamed, md. omar shadat sarker department of industrial engineering and management khulna university of engineering & technology khulna-9203, bangladesh ruhaniayth.binafsar@gmail.com, istiaqeahamed09@gmail.com, mdomarshadatsarker@gmail.com","References

29,7Th Bangladesh Conference On Industrial Engineering And Operations Management  Doi: 10.46254/Ba07.20240046,"additive manufacturing (am), commonly known as 3d printing, fabricates physical objects by successively adding layers of material. this technology is widely utilized for producing both metallic and non-metallic components. in particular, 3d printing has simplified the design, modification, and testing of non-metallic materials such as hyperelastic, thermoplastic, and rubber-like substances. however, accurate material modeling and validation are essential for analyzing these materials effectively. this study investigates the mechanical behavior of 3d-printed polylactic acid (pla) under varying temperatures through numerical validation, complementing experimental analysis. specimens were designed in solidworks according to astm d638 dimensional standards, with 100% infill density and a grid orientation angle of 0 degrees. the infill density and orientation angle significantly influence the mechanical properties of the specimens. the study focuses on three temperature conditions (20°c, 30°c, and 40°c) using a non-linear hyperelastic model (neo hookean, mooney-rivlin 2 parameter, and yeoh 3rd order). results demonstrate that temperature variations impact pla's mechanical behavior. all these models were identified as suitable hyperelastic models for these conditions, with neo-hookean offering simplicity due to its single-parameter formulation. additionally, a new equation was developed to estimate the model parameter of neo hookean for different temperatures.","infill density, hyperelasticity, pla+","This study investigates the mechanical behavior of 3D-printed PLA materials under varying thermal conditions through finite element analysis and hyperelastic modeling. By incorporating the Neo-Hookean, Mooney-Rivlin, and Yeoh models, we validated the strain-energy density of PLA at different temperatures, highlighting each model's accuracy and limitations. While the Neo-Hookean model offers simplicity, its single-parameter formulation struggles with high-strain nonlinearities. The Mooney-Rivlin model performs better across moderate strains, but the Yeoh model consistently provides the closest agreement with experimental data, especially under elevated temperatures.

To overcome these issues, the study focused on optimizing the CNC milling machine's cutting settings to reduce surface roughness and improve product quality. Our investigation comprised setting and adjusting parameters such as spindle speed, feed rate, and depth of cut to observe how they affected surface roughness (Ra). We discovered that surface roughness rises with increasing feed rates and depth of cut, whereas decreases with higher spindle speeds. Optimized cutting settings were a spindle speed of 2000 m/min, a feed rate of 700 mm/pass, and a depth of cut of 0.1 mm, resulting in a minimum surface roughness of 1.64256 μm. The key contributions of this research include optimizing CNC milling parameters using Response Surface Methodology (RSM) and regression analysis to achieve improved surface roughness on mild steel. The study offers an accurate predictive model for surface roughness, with an 80% accuracy in fitting investigated values, enhancing practical machining efficiency. For future research, the study can explore more complex materials or alloy combinations under varied CNC milling conditions. Furthermore, integrating modern optimization methods, such as machine learning algorithms, could improve the prediction accuracy of surface finishes, potentially broadening the model's application to other machining processes.","optimization of process parameters in cnc end milling of mild steel using response surface methodology rakesh roy, mohaiminul islam, mst. jeba shazida, raton kumar mollik, masum billah, shoyeb muhammad and sarojit kumar biswas department of industrial and production engineering, jashore university of science and technology (just), jashore 7408, bangladesh rakeshroy996@gmail.com, mohaiminul.islam.ie@gmail.com, jebashazida.ipe1920@gmail.com, raton.ipe17@gmail.com, masumipe7@gmail.com, sdiipgazi@gmail.com & sarojitipe@gmail.com",

When the current flow through the nichrome wire increases, the temperature increases and expands. Thus, the foam vapors fast, and the design of the foam gets distorted. On the other hand, when the current supply is low, the wire needs more mechanical force to cut, increasing the friction and providing rough surface. Also, any assumed current supply cannot get the minimum temperature fluctuations of the wire. That is why optimized cutting parameters are needed for accurate and smooth cutting, which is 0.53 mA in this case. Operating the CNC machine in this parameter provides optimum kerf width, cutting time and minimum temperature fluctuations. The optimized parameters on other types of foams can be analyzed in the future. Also, instead of using nichrome wires, the cutting parameters of other wires and their effect on surface roughness can be optimized. 392","effect of cutting parameters on performance of cnc hot wire styrofoam cutting machine md soad solaiman industrial and production engineering department military institute of science and technology dhaka, bangladesh soadsolaiman28@gmail.com md sakibul islam sakib industrial and production engineering department military institute of science and technology dhaka, bangladesh mdsakibulislam999@gmail.com md. arifur rahman industrial and production engineering department military institute of science and technology dhaka, bangladesh rahmanarifur1308@gmail.com adib bin rashid industrial and production engineering department military institute of science and technology dhaka, bangladesh adib@me.mist.ac.bd","References

In the beverage business, the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) can be useful in reducing waste, particularly in decision-making procedures where several factors must be taken into account. AHP is an organized approach to decision-making that helps in the categorization of options by methodically evaluating and contrasting factors according to their relative significance (Hassan, 2013). Kaizen, a Japanese philosophy promoting continuous improvement, can significantly aid the beverage industry in waste reduction by utilizing machine learning algorithms for process optimization and improved yield.

After systematic literature review and analysis many previous models are analyzed in the methodology section and finally using fuzzy topsis and BWM. The study will be based on questionnaire approach, so all the questionnaire are attached in the appendix section. From the responses of supply chain experts, I have found the best and worst criteria by applying the BWM method. Besides, the criteria weight was used to find the strategies ranking by the fuzzy topsis method. This study looked at adaptable SC techniques to lessen the effects of COVID-19 and modeled how these strategies relate to one another based on the opinions of experts. However, by utilizing structural equation modeling (SEM) and multiple regression based on more quantitative data, a more thorough association model can be created and validated in the future. Future comparisons between the ranking of flexible SCs tactics and other quantitative approaches are possible. Once more, the current research has investigated the adaptable strategies and combined them to recommend a single framework to enhance sustainability in the context of COVID-19. Additionally, it has several limitations. Although the data in this case was gathered from a few well-known Bangladeshi steel industries, the results might not accurately represent the entire situation. The proposed approach's conclusions are mostly concentrated on Bangladesh's steel sector, while they are intended to be relevant to other industries as well. Future research can assess the effects of employing these tactics in emerging economies' businesses. Additionally, the proposed model was created using the Bangladeshi steel industry as an emerging economy, Future research can be done on additional industries from both emerging and mature economies to generalize the results.

39,7Th Bangladesh Conference On Industrial Engineering And Operations Management  Doi: 10.46254/Ba07.20240060,"inventory control problems often arise in different types of businesses. this article presents a case study of a company dedicated to selling, installing and servicing industrial, commercial and residential air conditioning and heating. the company does not have internal control of its inventories in its product warehouses. in 2022-2023, 3,042 problems related to warehouse management were recorded, with an average of 84.49 problems/month. this caused economic problems, project delays, inadequate delivery times, and the inability to guarantee their quality certification goals in the short term. therefore, the objective of this study is to reduce these problems significantly. for this purpose, lean manufacturing tools such as 5s, kaizen, and kanban are implemented. after implementing the improvement, the company had formats for ordering and returning materials to the warehouses and a database for recording materials. in addition, warehouse problems were reduced to 79, with an average of 26.3 problems/month. this concludes that the application of lean manufacturing tools can have a significant impact on warehouse management.","warehouses, lean manufacturing, 5s, kaizen","and Recommendations Both the general objective and the specific objectives were met. Problems affecting the control and management of the company's warehouses were reduced by implementing lean manufacturing tools, such as the 5S. The specific objectives were met by reducing the problems affecting warehouse control, validating the physical stock of raw materials in the warehouses, storing the information in a new database, and establishing the use of Kaizen event formats for the company's continuous improvement. In addition, it is concluded that Kaizen, 5S and Kanban tools complement each other. To start with the Kaizen methodology, one must first have a 5S base. Based on the application sequence of the tools, raw materials and inputs can be easily located, allowing for quick and efficient inventory management. Kanban systems facilitate inventories and knowledge of raw materials and inputs moving within the company, with which products are codified, and all processes and activities are standardized. Once completed, Kaizen is applied, which allows for analyzing the problems detected in the process and their root causes. Finally, a strategy is applied to obtain the benefits of continuous improvement. This is obtained by estimating the training results with the personnel using the warehouses, allowing them to improve or find solutions before they are requested. On the other hand, it is recommended to maintain the current practices of the tools implemented, projecting them to other areas to improve the supply system. Staff should continue to receive training in new techniques and tools. It is recommended that the constant monitoring and evaluation of the improvement activities implemented continue, and the diagrams should be updated according to the changes in the procedure. In addition, it is recommended that the proposed management tools Kaizen, 5S, and Kanban be applied, as well as a checklist questionnaire every month immediately after completing the 5S process to improve the new processes within the warehouse area.","implementation of lean manufacturing tools for materials management in a warehouse arturo realyvásquez-vargas, brenda michelle castillo-ramírez, amalia carmina salinas-hernández, guadalupe hernández-escobedo department of industrial engineering tecnológico nacional de méxico/instituto tecnológico de tijuana tijuana, baja california, mexico arturo.realyvazquez@tectijuana.edu.mx, m21210032@tijuana.tecnm.mx, asalinas@tectijuana.edu.mx, guadalupe.hernandez@tectijuana.edu.mx",

The findings align closely with the research objectives. First, the analysis of waste generation, composition, and elemental characteristics revealed that 90% of RCC's solid waste is organic, with a high calorific value of 31.416 MJ/kg for food waste, supporting its energy recovery potential. This aligns with the objective of evaluating energy recovery opportunities within RCC's waste management system. Furthermore, the study identified the inefficiencies in recycling practices, as only 8.53% of recyclable waste is processed, emphasizing the need for enhanced source segregation and infrastructure. This addresses the objective of identifying challenges and proposing strategies for improved sustainability in RCC's waste management practices. The results further highlighted that integrating waste-to-energy technologies could generate approximately 7.01 MW of energy daily from organic waste. These findings underscore the feasibility of converting waste into valuable energy resources while reducing environmental impacts, fulfilling the objective of proposing actionable strategies. Despite its contributions, the study has some limitations. The analysis relied on data from a single urban center, which may not fully represent the diverse waste management challenges and opportunities across Bangladesh. Additionally, the study primarily focused on food and plastic waste, leaving other waste categories less explored. Projections for energy recovery and recycling potential were based on theoretical calculations and laboratory-scale experiments, which might differ from real-world outcomes due to technical, financial, and policy constraints. Future research could expand on these findings by exploring waste management practices across multiple cities to develop a more generalized framework for Bangladesh. Advanced waste characterization studies could also be conducted to include other waste types, such as hazardous or e-waste, to ensure comprehensive sustainability strategies. Moreover, pilot projects for waste-to-energy technologies in RCC could validate the energy recovery estimates and provide practical insights into implementation challenges and cost-benefit analyses. Lastly, examining public participation and policy interventions in waste management could yield actionable recommendations for fostering community involvement and policy alignment. This study lays a strong foundation for future initiatives in waste management, offering valuable insights for policymakers, researchers, and practitioners aiming to enhance energy recovery and environmental sustainability.","study of energy and environmental benefits from household solid waste in rajshahi city corporation md. kamrul hasan chowdhury, tapas barai nazrul islam, md. saddam hossain department of mechanical engineering, rajshahi university of engineering and technology, rajshahi 6204, bangladesh rimonchowdhury17@gmal.com, tapasbarairuet@gmail.com, shakilnazrul67@gmail.com, rohanruet09@gmail.com debashis biswas department of electrical engineering, national institute of technology, silchar, india debashis.bs@hotmail.com md. saimon chowdhury department of economics, jahangirnagar university, dhaka, bangladesh. saimonchowdhury99@gmail.com md. tanvir siraj department of mechanical engineering, bangladesh university of engineering and technology, dhaka, bangladesh tanvir25392@gmail.com",

FlexSim software helped to make car coating and assembly more efficient. When coating and assembly are done in separate plants, producing 500 cars takes 73.38 hours. In a combined plant, this time drops to 35 hours, saving 38.38 hours. This substantial time saving shows how combining processes can make work faster. Machine efficiency also improves from 73.24% in separate plants to 85.26% in the combined plant. While the quality rate (or yield ratio) is a bit lower in the combined setup, going from 98.62% to 93.96%, the trade-off is worth it because of the major gains in time and efficiency. These changes make production faster, more competitive, and more cost-effective. Also, according to iteration 29, it takes 35 hours to produce 500 automobiles. Thus, the production rate becomes 500/35= 14.28 ≈ 14 automobiles per hour. On 1 July 2018, Elon Musk tweeted that Tesla company had made 7000 cars in 7 days. According to it, the production rate was 7000/ (7*24) = 41.67 ≈ 41 automobiles per hour. From this data, it can be realized that our optimized production rate is realistic.

The simulations offered valuable insights into material flow, stress distribution, and thermal behavior during extrusion, revealing how parameters such as die geometry, ram speed, and friction coefficient impact extrusion performance. Optimal conditions were identified, including a friction coefficient of 0.08, a die angle of 20°, and a ram speed of 1.5 mm/s, resulting in a minimized extrusion force of 556,291 KN. Analysis of the extrusion speed effect highlighted maximum temperatures of 600°C for the die and 1030°C for the billet at ram speeds of 1-2 mm/s. The temperature-stress relationship analysis indicated peak stress at 1000 MPa at 20°C and minimal stress at 90 MPa at 1050°C. The integration of DEFORM 3D with MINITAB proved to be an efficient approach for optimizing process parameters, enhancing the quality and efficiency of extruded products. Future research could explore varying die geometries and temperature settings to further reduce extrusion forces. To further enhance the extrusion process, future research should explore varying die geometries, advanced cooling strategies, and the effects of different material compositions.

The NCACS transforms efficiency, productivity, and safety in a variety of industrial sectors by enabling the frictionless, accurate, and hygienic transportation of commodities and planar objects through the creative application of pneumatic technology. The non-contact shipping method used by the NCACS reduces wear and tear and enhances product quality by removing the possibility of damage to fragile items. When combined with sophisticated sensor technology and exact control algorithms, this frictionless operation guarantees precise alignment and positioning of transported objects, enabling high-precision movement with little deviation. Additionally, the NCACS has major advantages in terms of cleanliness and hygiene since it reduces physical contact with the conveyor surface, which lessens the buildup of dust, debris, and pollutants. This function is especially helpful in sectors like food processing, pharmaceuticals, and electronics production where hygienic conditions are crucial and cleanliness standards are very high. Because of its modular design and configurable features, the NCACS provides flexibility, adaptability, and scalability in addition to its operating advantages.

Ergonomic deficiencies, such as outdated machinery, poorly designed workspaces, and health concerns, contribute to reduced productivity and increase the risk of musculoskeletal disorders and respiratory issues. Unlike developed nations, where ergonomic practices are prioritized, Bangladesh's garment industry has yet to fully address these challenges due to a reliance on inexpensive labor and limited awareness. Through the application of the Analytical Network Process (ANP), the study reveals that the work environment has the most substantial influence on productivity (0.68), followed by individual characteristics (0.24) and health issues (0.08).

Blockchain technology improves traceability, operational efficiency, and security. Pilot testing in an actual RMG supply chain setting might be used for further validation in order to evaluate performance in an operating setting. 5. Conclusion The implementation of blockchain technology in Bangladesh’s RMG sector represents a critical advancement toward addressing key supply chain inefficiencies such as transparency, accountability, and fraud prevention. This study underscores the effectiveness of Hyperledger Fabric as a permissioned blockchain solution tailored to meet the specific needs of the RMG supply chain, allowing for secure, immutable record-keeping and real-time visibility across stakeholders. Such implementation of the proposed prototype promises transparency in raw material sourcing as it can be used to document, enable the manufacturer to get opinions from suppliers as well as select from their proposed deals. By enhancing data accuracy, reducing reliance on intermediaries, and automating compliance through smart contracts, blockchain presents a robust alternative to traditional systems, paving the way for enhanced stakeholder trust and reduced operational delays. As for the proposed smart contracts, their implementation will make documentation and compliance safer and more efficient. The comparative analysis reveals that blockchain’s distributed architecture minimizes risks related to single points of failure and upholds a streamlined, resilient supply chain that aligns with international compliance standards. Despite challenges such as initial implementation costs and technological integration, the study highlights blockchain’s transformative potential in modernizing the RMG industry, ensuring both sustainable growth and competitiveness on a global scale. Future research should explore the integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) with blockchain to provide predictive insights and further enhance the responsiveness of the RMG supply chain. Although the proposed model has the potential to improve the accuracy of real-time tracking and inventory control, the lack of an implementation environment caused a partial part of the objective of real-time tracking and inventory control to be accomplished. Although after the full buildup of the prototype we can easily integrate it in RMG industries to check its accuracy regarding real-time tracking.","implementing blockchain technology in the supply chain of rmg industries in bangladesh syed junayed ahmed niloy1, *, md. iftekhar alam1, shahed karim2, mohammad sarwar morshed1, tahmim alam1, nure arfi3 1department of mechanical and production engineering 2department of computer science and engineering 3department of textile engineering ahsanullah university of science & technology (aust), dhaka, bangladesh *syedniloy1996@gmail.com, ornabmd@gmail.com, info@shahedkarim.com, m.morshed.mpe@aust.edu, sat.tahmimalam@gmail.com, arfiya.arfi17@gmail.com",

Conclusion This study on optimizing coating thickness parameters in the low-pressure cold spraying (LPCS) process highlights the significant potential for achieving superior coating thickness compared to traditional thermal spraying methods. The research shows that adjustments in parameters such as powder feeding, carrier gas selection, and standoff distance have a substantial effect on coating thickness and overall quality. Confirmation experiments demonstrated that optimal settings, including the use of an Argon feeder, aluminum alloy substrate, 110 psi stagnation pressure, 400°C air temperature, and a 4.5 mm stand-off distance, resulted in a consistent coating thickness of 1.63 mm, within the predicted confidence interval. These results emphasize the importance of carefully selecting process parameters to achieve high-quality, durable coatings, especially in industries requiring precise performance. Future research should explore further improvements in powder distribution, separation distances, and the integration of advanced process control technologies to refine coating consistency and reduce material waste. Additionally, investigations into alternative gas feeding strategies and the effects of different substrates could expand the versatility of the Cold Spray process. The study also suggests that optimizing stagnation pressure and temperature can enhance particle velocity and softening, improving coating uniformity and adhesion. These findings provide valuable insights for enhancing the economic feasibility, durability, and overall performance of Cold Spray coatings in industrial applications.","optimization of coating thickness parameters and prediction of optimal range in the cold spray process rotan kumar saha1, md. tareque hasan1, safayet hossain1, md. nazmul hasan1, tuhin hosen1, md. shabaz abir kazi1, md. rahat bhuiyan1 1department of industrial and production engineering, dhaka university of engineering & technology, gazipur, gazipur-1707, bangladesh rotansaha@duet.ac.bd, tareque.me2019@gmail.com, safayetridu@gmail.com, nazmulhasan207015@gmail.com, tuhinhosenipe@gmail.com, abirkazi563859@gmail.com, brahat9880@gmail.com",

75,7Th Bangladesh Conference On Industrial Engineering And Operations Management  Doi: 10.46254/Ba07.20240107,"bangladesh faces a persistent energy crisis despite its abundant solar irradiation of 4.5 kwh/m² per day. rural electrification efforts have achieved limited success due to high costs and infrastructural constraints. this paper proposes a sustainable and cost-effective dc photovoltaic (pv) water pumping system designed to address irrigation demands in rural areas. by directly connecting a pv array to a dc water pump, the system avoids the need for an inverter, significantly reducing both initial and operational costs. the system incorporates maximum power point tracking (mppt) to optimize energy utilization, a dc-dc boost converter to enhance current delivery, and a battery to ensure reliable operation during inconsistent sunlight conditions. all components are locally sourced, minimizing 841",,", the integration of MPPT, a boost converter, and battery storage significantly improves energy efficiency and provides a more reliable water pumping solution, particularly in regions with unpredictable sunlight. 5. Conclusion The performance of solar water pumping systems depends significantly on their design. In this analysis, we compared two systems: a directly coupled solar water pumping system with Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) and a system that includes both MPPT and battery storage. Both systems were modeled and simulated using MATLAB/Simulink. In the directly coupled system, the rotor speed, flow rate, and armature current are directly proportional to solar irradiation. As solar irradiation fluctuates, these parameters also change, affecting the performance of the Permanent Magnet DC (PMDC) motor. The efficiency of the PMDC motor depends on its rotor speed, with peak efficiency achieved at a specific speed determined by its characteristic curves. Moreover, the water demand often limits the input power to the rated capacity of the PMDC motor, which may require selecting a motor with a higher horsepower (HP) rating. This increase in HP raises both capital costs and the need for a larger water storage tank to accommodate the extra power generated, further escalating the system’s costs. In contrast, a solar water pumping system equipped with battery storage and a regulating boost converter offers superior efficiency. This system allows the motor to operate at a more consistent speed, improving its efficiency and enabling it to function closer to its optimal performance point. The battery storage stores excess energy, providing a buffer during cloudy days and enhancing the system’s reliability. Consequently, a motor with a lower horsepower rating can be selected, which reduces the initial capital investment and allows for a smaller water storage tank, compared to the directly coupled system. While integrating battery storage and a boost converter may increase initial capital costs, the enhanced efficiency and reliability of the system ultimately outweigh the benefits of the directly coupled approach. Operating at a consistent speed led to higher motor efficiency, lower horsepower requirements, and reduced storage tank size, making the system more cost-effective and efficient overall. Future work will focus on further optimizing the system's design, particularly the integration of IoT-based monitoring for real-time performance tracking and predictive maintenance. This will enable better monitoring of system health and improve long-term reliability, ensuring that the system remains a viable solution for irrigation and other applications in rural areas.","analysis and dynamic modelling of a solar water pumping system md.suruz ali department of electrical and electronic engineering pabna university of science and technology, pabna, dhaka, bangladesh suruz.eee.pust36@gmail.com md.ebrahim khallil department of electrical and computer engineering tennessee technological university, cookeville, tennessee, usa ebrahim140232@gmail.com md. hanif reza department of electrical and electronic engineering pabna university of science and technology, pabna, dhaka, bangladesh hanif.rezapusteee@gmail.com md ariful islam department of electrical and electronic engineering khulna university of engineering and technology (kuet), ,khulna, bangladesh arifislam044@gmail.com md. rubel department of electrical and electronic engineering rajshahi university of engineering and technology (ruet), rajshahi, bangladesh mrh.rueteee@gmail.com",

A short-term risk management plan (1- 3 months) offers the best balance between timeliness, feasibility, and flexibility, making it the best option for successfully mitigating supply chain risks, according to our assessment of five major risk criteria: operational, financial, environmental, social, and market risks. Validation methods, such as consistency checks, which show the model's resilience and dependability, provide more credence to this view. The incorporation of neutrosophic values into the AHP framework improves the model's capacity to manage uncertainty and offers a more thorough tool for supply chain risk. This work could be further done in the future by adding more criteria and carrying out longitudinal studies to track the changing effects of particular risk management strategies.

First of all, the key problems of the current embankment systems in Bangladesh are identified. Then, the hydraulic stability and performance of Traditional cubes, Tetrapods, and Accropodes under various environmental conditions is assessed. Besides this, a comprehensive economic analysis was done to determine the cost-effectiveness of each armor unit. Those assessments conclude that among the three armors, Accropodes is the most stable and economically beneficial. Enhancing the design such as adding rough surfaces can ensure the sustainability of armor units. Apart from improving the efficiency of the measures taken for the coastal protection, this approach combined helps to achieve economic viability, an issue of import for such a country as for instance Bangladesh with its restricted fund base. Given that Accropodes are relatively new to the coast defense system in Bangladesh, the techniques used in constructing these structures are unique hence may need specialists with revelation knowledge to apply. So, identifying appropriate methods for incorporating Accropodes within the existing structure of the embankment systems is necessary. Future studies should aim at the development of the combined design that uses the benefits of current embankment systems integrated with the features of Accropodes. The results show that Accropodes represent the best option for improving coastal protection in Bangladesh.

This innovation focuses on rapid cooling and boasts a compact, lightweight design, allowing users to enjoy their beverages at the ideal temperature in no time. The selection of a Peltier module as a small and lightweight temperature-regulating device proves to be highly effective. One notable advantage of the Peltier module is its lifespan of over 200000 hours, alleviating concerns about the reliability of a portable device. When the Peltier module is in operation, one side becomes cold while the opposite side becomes very hot. To prevent damage to the Peltier module from overheating, an active heat sink is utilized to properly manage the hot side. Maintaining the Peltier module's operating temperature below 39.4 °C will contribute to its longevity. In addition, incorporating Bluetooth or Wi-Fi functionality for wireless power and control can enhance user convenience by enabling remote monitoring and management via a smartphone app. Offering a fresh perspective on portable cooling, the Mini Portable Cooling Cup harmoniously combines portability, efficiency, and eco-friendliness. While the Peltier module is a compact cooling solution, it has a relatively low cooling capacity and requires more time to cool objects. To advance deep and rapid cooling systems, the incorporation of nanotechnology heat insulators for temperature regulation, along with upgraded p-type and n-type connections, could be explored.

88,7Th Bangladesh Conference On Industrial Engineering And Operations Management  Doi: 10.46254/Ba07.20240147,"this study analyzes bangladesh's electricity growth trends with a focus on renewable energy development over the past two decades. descriptive statistical methods, including linear trends, were employed to assess growth rates, percentage contributions, and global rankings of renewable and non-renewable energy capacities. data from international renewable energy agency (irena) (2000–2023) were utilized. key variables, such as installed capacities and energy source contributions, were categorized by type (solar, hydro, wind, bioenergy) and grid status (on-grid, off-grid). the results reveal an annual growth rate of 1,012.57 mw for non-renewable energy and 33.73 mw for renewable energy, highlighting the disparity in development. renewable energy's share in total capacity declined from 5.23% in 2000 to 3.53% in 2023. solar energy dominates bangladesh's renewable capacity (76.32%), followed by hydropower (22.87%). however, the country ranks 39th globally in total electricity capacity but only 107th in renewable capacity, reflecting limited progress in diversifying renewable sources. the findings emphasize the need for strategic policy interventions to enhance renewable energy development in bangladesh.",renewable energy,"The findings of this study address the research gap identified at the outset, which highlights the lack of a comprehensive understanding of Bangladesh’s renewable energy growth trends and its global standing in electricity capacity. The results reveal that while Bangladesh has made significant strides in increasing its overall electricity installed capacity, the progress in renewable energy development remains disproportionately low. The decline in the percentage contribution of renewables, from 5.23% in 2000 to 3.53% in 2023, underscores the persistent challenges in achieving sustainable energy growth.The study's objectives of examining electricity capacity growth, assessing global rankings, and analyzing the composition of renewable energy sources have been systematically addressed. The analysis demonstrates that solar energy dominates Bangladesh's renewable portfolio, contributing over three-quarters of the total renewable capacity, with negligible bioenergy and wind energy contributions. Furthermore, the country’s global ranking in renewable energy capacity (107th) is significantly lower compared to its total electricity capacity ranking (39th), indicating a stark disparity in its renewable energy advancement. These insights align with the study’s aim of highlighting Bangladesh's inadequate focus on renewable energy development. The findings emphasize the need for policymakers to prioritize renewable energy expansion to bridge the gap between Bangladesh’s overall electricity growth and its renewable energy contributions. Closing this gap is essential for achieving the objectives of SDG 7 and promoting long-term energy sustainability.This study lays a foundation for future research and policy interventions by highlighting the dominant reliance on solar energy and the limited growth of other renewable sources. To achieve a balanced and sustainable energy mix, targeted efforts to diversify renewable energy investments and enhance off-grid systems are essential. These strategies will enable Bangladesh to improve its global renewable energy standing, mitigate the impacts of climate change, and promote energy equity.","bangladesh's electricity growth: is bangladesh truly advancing in renewable energy? spandan basak payel, shah ikthiar alam, mirza lakitul bari, syed salman saeed, and md. tanvir siraj department of mechanical engineering bangladesh university of engineering and technology (buet) dhaka, bangladesh spandanbasak@gmail.com, ikthiar.alam@outlook.com, tusharmirza.tm@gmail.com, salmansbuet@gmail.com, tanvir25392@gmail.com",

Linear regression performed better than exponential smoothing among the tested methods, which makes it a suitable option for demand prediction in this context. Applying these forecasts to an inventory model demonstrated improvements in cost efficiency and supply reliability. There is a lot of potential for optimizing supply chain operations, reducing expenses, and enhancing service delivery in the pharmaceutical industry by integrating demand forecasting and EOQ for inventory management. Stochastic modeling, AI, real-time data tracking, and collaborative forecasting are all important fields where innovation can keep pushing the envelope of what is feasible. Pharmaceutical companies can achieve more effective, responsive, and sustainable inventory management systems by addressing the particular difficulties faced by the industry, such as perishability, regulatory complexity, and demand variability. However, the analysis was based on a limited dataset, which may restrict the breadth and reliability of the results across different contexts. The analysis could include a larger dataset to increase forecasting accuracy and offer a more in-depth understanding of demand trends.

126,7Th Bangladesh Conference On Industrial Engineering And Operations Management  Doi: 10.46254/Ba07.20240204,"bagasse fibers, like other natural fibers, exhibit geometric irregularities. their diameters vary not only between individual fibers but also along the length of each fiber, leading to considerable variation in tensile strength. in a previous study, we analyzed the deformation, stress, and strain behavior of bagasse fiber-reinforced composites in ansys workbench, assuming the fibers had a cylindrical shape. this study builds on our previous work by incorporating the effects of geometric irregularities. the bagasse fibers were first examined under an optical microscope, and images were processed using imagej software to measure fiber diameters at multiple points. these measurements were then used to model the fibers in ansys, employing blend tool features to create geometrically irregular fiber structures. the results indicate that variations in fiber geometry significantly affect the deformation, stress, and strain behavior of the composites. 1209",,"A linear-elastic finite element model is employed to understand the effect of bagasse fiber geometric irregularities on the deformation, strain, and stress behavior of bagasse fiber-reinforced composites. The findings of this research are summarized below: The level of diameter variation significantly influences the tensile behavior of the fiber-reinforced composite material. The bagasse fiber is found to carry the majority of the applied load. The stress in the bagasse fiber is roughly 2.32 times higher than that in the epoxy matrix. This is because the bagasse fiber is much stiffer (with higher tensile strength and Young's modulus) than the epoxy resin, and thus carries most of the applied load. The strain in the matrix is about 2.15 times higher than that in the bagasse fibers. This is due to the lower Young's modulus of the matrix, which causes it to deform more to accommodate the displacement, resulting in higher strain. The level of geometric irregularities in the bagasse fiber significantly influences the tensile properties of both the fiber and the composite. Both stress and strain gradients are high in regions where sharp geometric irregularities are observed. The fiber weakens in these stress-concentrated zones, leading to a decrease in the fiber's breaking load. Acknowledgment We would like to express our gratitude to Ahsanullah University of Science and Technology (AUST) for providing the research grant (Project ID: ARP/2022/MPE/03/08) that enabled this work.","modeling the effects of geometrical irregularities in bagasse fibers on composite behavior using ansys workbench abdullah al masud, md. rayhan chowdhury and saimul hossen sikder department of mechanical and production engineering ahsanullah university of science and technology dhaka-1208, bangladesh abdullahmasud0208@gmail.com dr. md. kharshiduzzaman department of mechanical and production engineering ahsanullah university of science and technology dhaka-1208, bangladesh kharshid.mpe@aust.edu dr. m. azizur rahman associate professor brac business school brac university bir uttam rafiqul islam avenue, merul badda, dhaka-1212, bangladesh azizur.rahman@bracu.ac.bd dr. md. shahnewaz bhuiyan department of mechanical and production engineering ahsanullah university of science and technology dhaka-1208, bangladesh newaz.mpe@aust.edu",
127,7Th Bangladesh Conference On Industrial Engineering And Operations Management  Doi: 10.46254/Ba07.20240205,"welding is a process where two similar or dissimilar metals are joined to create a complex joint used in various fields. among the many welding methods, arc welding stands out as one of the best. in arc welding, two metals are brought into contact, and the junction is heated, causing the metal to melt and fill the gap between the parent metals. this study aims to identify the most effective edge joint for arc welding and optimize the process parameters for welding bsrm a 415 square bars. optimizing welding parameters is crucial because they significantly influence the quality of the weld. without determining the optimal values, the experiment cannot be accurately completed, and the resulting prod- ucts may lack long-term sustainability. bsrm a 415 square bars were chosen due to their quality billets, guaranteed strength, safe welding properties, and iso certification. they are ideal for intricate structural designs and offer both strength and cost efficiency. four input parameters were selected for the welding process: welding current, voltage, travel speed, and electrode diameter, with hardness and ultimate tensile strength as output responses. the study used the taguchi orthogonal array and grey fuzzy methods to analyze and optimize the parameters. these methodologies, along with various tools and techniques, helped achieve the desired outcomes effectively.","edge joint, arc welding, taguchi method","Taguchi method used signal to noise ratio, ANOVA analysis. From SN analysis we see that Groove angle is the highly impact parameter and voltage is less important parameter in terms of ultimate tensile strength, for hardness groove angle is also very high significant parameter and voltage is very low significant parameter. From ANOVA testing we see that groove angle has highest contribution on the output parameters for ultimate tensile strength and for hardness groove angle has also highest contribution on the output parameters. For grey fuzzy method to find out the optimal solution we followed some steps, these are data normalization, deviation sequence, grey relational coefficient and finally Grey fuzzy reasoning grade. From each and every step we noticed that in experiment no 24 we got our optimal solution. The solution is current(I)= 170A, voltage(V)= 16V, Travel speed (TS)= 11mm/min, welding diameter (D)= 2.5mm, groove angle = 60 degree. This research opens several avenues for further exploration. Future studies could focus on a broader range of material types, including advanced alloys and composites, to assess how different welding edge configurations affect performance across various industries. Additionally, examining the impact of dynamic welding conditions, such as temperature and humidity, on edge types and joint angles could yield valuable insights for real-world applications. Long-term performance analysis of welded joints with optimized edge configurations is an- other important area for future research. Conducting durability and fatigue tests will help understand how these joints perform over time. Furthermore, exploring the effects of modern welding techniques, like laser welding and friction stir welding, on edge performance can lead to innovative solutions and applications.","analyzing the best arc welding parameters following the best edge joint using taguchi and grey fuzzy method md. riafedul islam rifat, md. saiful islam safi, md. ahamed hossain yousuf, md. ariful islam department of industrial & production engineering rajshahi university of engineering & technology, rajshahi-6204, bangladesh rifat1805060@gmail.com, safisaiful99@gmail.com shukdev bhowmick department of mechanical engineering rajshahi university of engineering & technology, rajshahi-6204, bangladesh shukdev.me.ruet@gmail.com",

135,7Th Bangladesh Conference On Industrial Engineering And Operations Management  Doi: 10.46254/Ba07.20240213,"rotodynamic type pumps, particularly centrifugal pumps, enable lifting of liquid from a lower to higher level by developing dynamic pressure. the effect of the blade exit angle on centrifugal pump efficiency is a crucial aspect of pump design and operation as it has significant effects on flow dynamics, energy transfer, and pressure performance. so, careful design and optimization of this parameter is important for substantial improvements in pump efficiency and operational effectiveness. the study focuses on adjusting the blade exit angles and analyzing their effects on the pump's hydraulic performance. using pumps with varying blade exit angles, a number of tests were carried out under close observation of important performance metrics like discharge rate, flow velocity, and overall efficiency. impellers were designed using solidworks 2020, and fabricated using additive manufacturing by polylactic acid (pla) to measure the performance of a centrifugal pump with different blade exit angles ranging from 40° to 90°. the experiments were carried out with a motor running at around 2990 rpm. the results showed that the efficiency of the centrifugal pump was significantly affected by the blade exit angle, with a maximum efficiency obtained at a blade exit angle of 40o. as the blade exit angle decreases, the efficiency of the centrifugal pump increases. when the fluid flowed through the impeller, it gained kinetic energy and was directed towards the pump volute where the kinetic energy was converted into pressure energy. by decreasing the impeller blade exit angle, the fluid was directed more effectively towards the volute and there was less recirculation, resulting in an increased pump efficiency. however, decreasing the blade exit angle too much could also have negative effects on pump performance. it is also concluded that the metallic impeller has a better discharge rate and flow velocity than non-metallic impellers but is very close in terms of efficiency with the impeller of a similar angle. however, the cost of the impeller made using additive manufacturing by polylactic acid (pla) is far lower than metallic impellers of the same parameters. the experimental study sheds light on how changing the blade exit angle of the impeller affects the efficiency of a centrifugal pump. impellers with various exit angles were fabricated using additive manufacturing, their efficiencies were determined, and different parameters were analyzed to successfully conduct this experimental work.","centrifugal pump, blade exit angle, pump efficiency","The experimental study investigated how variations in the blade exit angle of an impeller affect the efficiency of a centrifugal pump. Impellers with different exit angles were fabricated, and their efficiencies were measured alongside the analysis of key parameters. The primary findings are as follows: Among the three impellers tested, the one with the smallest blade exit angle achieved the highest efficiency at 51.40%, followed by 50.52% for the 70° impeller and 49.95% for the 90° impeller. This suggests that decreasing the blade exit angle enhances efficiency up to an optimal point for centrifugal pumps. The 70° impeller had the highest discharge rate at 279.2 cm³/s, followed by the 90° and 40° impellers, which produced discharge rates of 253.4 cm³/s and 213.7 cm³/s, respectively. Therefore, the 40° impeller demonstrated the lowest discharge rate. The study also compared metallic and non-metallic impellers, concluding that while the metallic impeller exhibited superior discharge rate and flow velocity, its efficiency was only marginally better than that of a non-metallic impeller with a similar blade angle. While the 40° impeller delivered the highest efficiency for a half-horsepower centrifugal pump, its fabrication was more complex and costly, and it exhibited the lowest discharge rate. Conversely, the 70° impeller, although slightly less efficient, achieved the highest discharge rate, with a higher fabrication cost than the radial impeller. Considering all factors, the 70° blade exit angle impeller is the most suitable option for a ½ hp centrifugal pump, with efficiency comparable to that of the gunmetal impeller. The results further suggest that while traditional gunmetal impellers still provide the highest efficiency and durability, impellers made from PLA using additive manufacturing are a more cost-effective solution for small production lines where similar efficiency is required, but high manometric head or extended longevity are not as critical. The experiment demonstrates that PLA impellers manufactured through additive processes offer efficiency on par with gunmetal impellers, with the added benefit of lower cost. Further research is recommended to address the challenge of lower head performance to improve the applicability of PLA impellers. 1245","experimental study on the effect of blade exit angle on centrifugal pump efficiency md. muhaimenul haque mechanical engineering department khulna university of engineering and technology khulna, bangladesh muhaimenul042.me.kuet@gmail.com masuka mahnur oishy mechanical engineering department khulna university of engineering and technology khulna, bangladesh masukamahnuroishy@gmail.com","References

Our research found that while the open-circuit voltage stayed mostly the same, the short-circuit current decreased as the distance between the electrodes increased because of higher resistance. Increasing amount of electrolyte improved the current flow which improve high number of ion movement. However, over time the organic electrolytes became less effective as their acidity dropped due to microbial growth. To solve this, an electrolyte flow system was added, which improved ion circulation, stabilized the voltage, and slowed down discharge, making the battery more efficient and lasting longer. The idea of electrolyte flowing system reduces the fast discharge rate and stables the voltage at a certain level. Moreover, this idea can be implemented in industry on a greater scale by using improvised techniques which will provide power as well as potentially abandon the environmental impact of liquid waste by reducing its acidity. Future work could focus on improving the stability of these electrolytes, making the flow system work for larger setups.

After thorough research and collaboration, we unanimously agreed that photovoltaic (PV) solar panels are the optimal choice for electricity generation. While the upfront installation costs may be significant, the long-term savings on energy bills make this investment not only economically viable but also environmentally responsible. In an era of dwindling natural resources, this approach offers a self-sustaining, energy-efficient, and eco-friendly pathway to achieving a truly Zero Energy building. Strategically placing the solar panels on the south-facing backside of the building maximizes sunlight absorption, ensuring peak performance and efficiency. As Bangladesh advances in integrating solar panels, promoting natural sunlight for lighting, and adopting solar heating systems to reduce dependency on air conditioning, the country is paving the way for sustainable development. We recommend that, in addition to BNBC guidelines, Bangladesh formulates a comprehensive master plan and enforces robust policies for Net Zero Energy Buildings (NetZEBs).

Analytics showed seasonality by year; Q1 peaks and July-August production dips were prominent. This is likely the monsoon season and shows how the weather impacts factory production in Bangladesh. While there were signs of some movement generally up in production, this was more suggestive of a mild growth scenario for the heavy industries category. This very modest trend is a harbinger for further growth and more broadening opportunities. SARIMA (1,1,1) (1,1,1,12) Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE): 34.84 % and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 16,349 MT Model Performance: Moderate forecasting accuracy The preliminary model SARIMA (1,1,1) (1,1,1,12) production is a challenging combination of capturing significant patterns in the data while also identifying the substantial variability in productions. The fact that the best we can do is to extend those error bars into the future reflects the wide confidence intervals in our six-month forecast, especially for those later months. Such undetermined nature mirrors the intricate and lively role of the elements that determine output within its heavy industry sectors in Bangladesh.","demand forecasting of steel industries’ finished product using arima model: bangladesh perspective ehsanul karim, m s rabbi, s c banik department of mechanical engineering, chittagong university of engineering & technology, chattogram-4349 rabbi@cuet.ac.bd",

The primary data retrieved from respondents categorized three namely: development of students’ academic performance, students’ international relevance, and economic development of the institution. In the former category, it was revealed that the most dominant benefits of adopting 4IR tools in higher education institutions by developing students’ academic capacity factors are the development of new learning & thinking skills and better communication between students & lecturers. Good relationship between the lecturers and students coupled with the development of new learning & thinking skills in HEIs, improves teaching, student’s achievements and lowers the number of students who drop out because lecturers can easily provide tutorial support via the internet through e-mail and forums. Other benefits are that students would use an electronic forum. The university can be ranked as one of the best universities globally, universities contribute to the country's economy, and lecturers will provide tutorial support. The students’ international relevance has the following benefits: advancement of international linked programmes and improved academic performance has the highest benefits. The latter category (Economic development of the institution) has the following benefits in the order of hierarchy: High rate of student admissions; Universities contribution to social development and a low dropout rate of students. 1552","the benefits of adopting fourth industrial revolution (4ir) technologies in higher education institutions (heis)- a case of south african institutions thalente nkosi, sibongile dlamini department of civil engineering durban university of technology pietermaritzburg, rsa thalentelungile4@gmail.com, mabongidlamini84@gmail.com morena william nkomo department of construction management and quantity surveying university of johannesburg johannesburg, rsa mnkomo@uj.ac.za","References

Of the 20 case studies analyzed, the Certainty Factor method managed to achieve an accuracy level of 95%, while the Dempster-Shafer method achieved an accuracy level of 90%. Although both methods show strong ability in diagnosing cassava diseases, these results indicate that the Certainty Factor method is slightly superior in terms of accuracy compared to the Dempster-Shafer method. These findings provide valuable insights for practitioners in choosing the most effective method for precise diagnosis of cassava disease. In addition, the difference in accuracy between these two methods can also provide guidance for further research to optimize the use of each method in different contexts. Although the Certainty Factor shows superiority in accuracy, the Dempster-Shafer method still has strong potential, especially in situations involving high uncertainty and incomplete data. Both approaches can be used complementarily, depending on the specific condition and the need for diagnosis. Thus, this study not only highlights the advantages and limitations of each method, but also opens up opportunities for further development in the integration of the two methods, in order to improve the accuracy and effectiveness of cassava plant disease diagnosis in the future.","an in-depth comparative analysis of dempster-shafer and certainty factor approaches for precision cassava disease diagnosis sufiatul maryana management informatics, vocational school pakuan university bogor 16134, indonesia sufiatul.maryana@unpak.ac.id irma anggraeni and muhammad mahdavikia department of computer science pakuan university bogor 16134, indonesia irmairhamna@unpak.ac.id, mahdavikia.065119233@unpak.ac.id",
