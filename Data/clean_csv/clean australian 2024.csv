We can see the most problem of ship transport is associated with energy efficiency of ships. It is important to improve the ship energy efficiency and reduce the ship emissions. Various emission reduction measures have been proposed to reduce the ship emissions. Fuel efficiency also make a lot of effect to environments and management cost. From the analysis, we see that the major hotspot for environmental effect comes from the operational process.

If this sample is not representative of the entire population of small and middle-scale logistics and warehousing enterprises, the study's generalizability may be limited. Furthermore, many survey questions rely on the views and judgements subjected to respondents. Although these insights are useful, there's a likelihood that they might insinuate elements of subjectivity and even bias into the answers. The study's primary reliance on survey data, a single form of data gathering. he exclusive use of this method may constrain the depth of insights that can be gained. Finally, the study did not deeply explore the specifics of implementation and the potential hurdles that may be encountered during the execution of the proposed solutions. Moreover, it is imperative to acknowledge specific limitations. Firstly, the study's findings and recommendations are subject to the fast-paced evolution of technology and industry trends. This inherent time sensitivity implies that the applicability of the suggested solutions may wane over time if they are not continually revised and tailored to adapt to evolving circumstances. Secondly, the generalizability of the study's findings may have constraints rooted in the context and the sample used for the survey. It is plausible that the results may not universally apply to all small and middle-scale logistics and warehousing enterprises. Additionally, the implementation of the proposed solutions might face limitations due to the availability of resources, including financial, technological, and a skilled workforce. The market dynamics, governmental regulations, and economic conditions are examples of external elements that can affect the effectiveness of automation technology implementation. These outside variables may affect how successfully the suggested remedies work and are outside of the enterprises' control. 6. Conclusion In conclusion, this project has effectively addressed the research questions and has successfully achieved the research objectives. The analysis of survey data have yielded valuable insights into the formidable challenges encountered by small-scale warehouses as they strive to implement automation for optimizing their processes. Chief among these challenges is the substantial financial burden that often obstructs the adoption of automation solutions in small-scale warehouses. These establishments frequently grapple with limited capital and investment capacity, serving as a significant impediment. Our findings have shed light on potential solutions, including government intervention and the imperative need for pilot runs. Pilot tests have proven to be instrumental in shifting prevailing mindsets and facilitating the transition towards automation. Furthermore, our research has delved deeply into the contribution of various automation technologies towards enhancing efficiency and productivity within small-scale warehouses. Despite the prominent barriers, especially the challenge of securing adequate funding, our study underscores the critical need to extend opportunities and trust to Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). This empowerment is crucial for SMEs to make meaningful contributions to economic growth and transformation. A compelling aspect that has emerged is the remarkable synergy among barcode scanners, Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs), and OCR scanners. These technologies effectively complement each other, streamlining processes within small-scale warehouses and delivering tangible benefits. The collaborative approach optimizes inventory management, enhances order fulfillment accuracy, and reduces operational costs. Our exploration of effective strategies and best practices for implementing automation in small-scale warehouses has also provided essential insights. The survey results underscore the significance of conducting pilot tests to assess the feasibility and benefits of automation. Furthermore, reskilling and educating employees are vital components of successful automation adoption.

Now we have reviewed how some of the optimal technologies are changing key sectors such as demand planning, inventory management, warehouse management and real time visibility of the supply chain. Almost all the drawbacks of classical approaches to inventory management, such as inaccuracy in forecast, lack of visibility, and reliance on manual work, are solved by the use of AI technologies. These modern solutions contribute to higher results and organizational effectiveness, accompanied by increased accuracy and lower costs, as noted with regards to the overall improvement of organizational performance and customer satisfaction. The findings from our implementation results in this analysis are consistent with the structure across the different industrial sectors, thus showing the potential gains of the AI application in inventory management, where there is greater accuracy on the forecast in addition to inventory cost reduction, a boost in the storage section, and overall supply chain robustness. Using the AI system to manage inventories is not easy, but the return on investment for these businesses is relatively worth the effort. In fact, as mentioned in the previous sections, the implementation of such interventions is conditioned by proper planning, effective data management, and subsequent continuous evaluation of the process and its improvement. In modern business, therefore, the integration of AI in inventory management is not an option but a necessity in today’s dynamic digital world. Any business that is able to incorporate these technologies will stand to benefit from the increasing flexibility in the market environment, thereby fulfilling customer needs and widening the competitive gap.

Contributions to the field of study include the empirical validation of an integrated Lean Manufacturing and TPM model specifically for SMEs in the plastics sector, a segment that faces unique challenges due to its scale and limited resources. This study expands the existing literature by demonstrating that the combination of these philosophies can be successfully adapted to SMEs, achieving significant improvements in operational efficiency and reducing defects and downtime. Additionally, the methodological approach employed can serve as a basis for future research and applications in other industrial sectors, contributing to the development of more effective and sustainable management practices. Finally, some observations and suggestions for further studies are offered. Additional research exploring the implementation of the model in different industrial and geographical contexts is recommended to validate its applicability and effectiveness under various conditions. It would also be valuable to investigate the integration of emerging technologies, such as Industry 4.0, into the proposed model to further enhance the efficiency and responsiveness of SMEs. Moreover, future studies could focus on measuring the long-term impact of implementing these practices on the sustainability and economic growth of companies, providing a broader perspective on the associated benefits and challenges.","enhancing operational efficiency in plastic manufacturing smes through lean manufacturing and tpm: a case study jampier anderson navarro-bendezu bachelors in industrial engineering facultad de ingeniería, universidad de lima, peru 20193147@aloe.ulima.edu.pe smith nicacio serna-granados bachelors in industrial engineering facultad de ingeniería, universidad de lima, peru 20191914@aloe.ulima.edu.pe",

The rate of delay in the delivery of goods was reduced by 65.67%, from 67% to 23%. The rate of defective products decreased by 23.08%, from 26% to 20%. The reprocessing rate also experienced a reduction of 27.27%, dropping from 22% to 16%. Productivity notably increased by 84.62%, from 13 to 24 units per day. Additionally, the cycle time was reduced by 25%, from 26.8 minutes to 20.1 minutes. These results indicate that the model not only improved operational efficiency but also increased the final product quality and production capacity. The research conducted is of great importance because it comprehensively addresses the critical challenges faced by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the textile sector, especially regarding efficiency and quality in production. The implementation of Lean Manufacturing techniques, such as the 5S methodology, Methods-Time Measurement (MTM), and line balancing, proved effective in solving common problems in SMEs, such as high rates of defective products, prolonged cycle times, and low productivity. Adopting these practices not only improves internal processes but also contributes to the economic and competitive sustainability of companies in an increasingly demanding market. The contributions of this study to the field of industrial engineering are significant. The proposed synergistic production model integrates various Lean Manufacturing tools, demonstrating that their joint application can generate more robust and sustainable results than the isolated implementation of each tool. This holistic approach provides a practical and applicable framework for SMEs, particularly in the textile industry context, allowing for continuous improvement in their production processes. Additionally, the study offers empirical validation of Lean Manufacturing techniques, providing concrete evidence of their benefits in terms of operational efficiency and product quality. Finally, final observations and suggestions for future studies are offered. It is recommended to explore the adaptability of the proposed model to other industrial sectors to evaluate its effectiveness in different production contexts. Future research could also focus on the long-term impact of implementing these tools on the economic and environmental sustainability of companies.

After performing detailed time studies and implementation of lean principles, considerable improvements were achieved in two cells, where the overall cycle time was reduced by 30 minutes in Cell 2 and Cell 3 effectively, showcasing efficiency gains of 2.75% and 5.68% respectively. The significant gains were achieved by eliminating non-value-added activities and optimizing work processes. The focus was to reduce setup times and streamline the overall material handling process. Further scope of research would help in addressing constraints and opportunities of the other workstations. Overall, process optimization along with the use of lean manufacturing tools demonstrated how productivity can be increased and processes can be streamlined in various manufacturing settings.","takt time reduction of genset assembly line using process optimization and lean manufacturing tools ninad joshi and kuldeep agarwal, ph.d. department of automotive and manufacturing engineering technology minnesota state university mankato, mn 56001, usa kuldeep.agarwal@mnsu.edu",

Successful results were observed after the successful implementation of the suggested improvisations. • To find the bottleneck station, a time study was conducted for each station on the assembly line while also documenting the performance of the operators. • Solder station was the bottleneck station in the current phase where most of the negative impact was due the inefficiency of operator “F”. • Operator “F” was replaced with operator “X” and the overall cycle time of the process was reduced to 42.5 seconds which meant that the updated bottleneck station was heat stake station. The production efficiency was increased to 76 %. • To reduce the cycle time on heat stake station, one of the suggested changes was to replace the heat stake machine with the updated machine which will reduce the cycle time of the station to 36 seconds. • Another suggested change was to include another heat stake machine in the line which will reduce the cycle time of the station to 23.2 seconds and the updated bottleneck station will be the solder station with a cycle time of 42.5 seconds. The successful implementation of the DMAIC process has increased the production numbers by nearly 200 units per shift, which could be improved if the suggested improvements are implemented.","optimizing production in an electronics manufacturing industry using six sigma: a dmaic approach to process enhancement shubham parekh, kuldeep agarwal and pawan bhandari department of automotive & manufacturing engineering technology minnesota state university mankato, mn 56001, usa kuldeep.agarwal@mnsu.edu",

The specific objectives were to build a virtual representation of the existing local train service, evaluate the effects of introducing an express train service on key performance metrics, and identify the stations that should be included in the express train route. All these objectives were successfully met, and the study provides several unique contributions to the field of urban transportation systems. First, a detailed virtual representation of the existing local train service was developed using the discrete-event simulation software FlexSim. This virtual model accurately mimics the current system's operational dynamics, including train schedules, passenger arrival rates, and capacity constraints, serving as a robust platform for further analysis and scenario testing. Second, introducing an express train service was thoroughly evaluated in terms of its impact on the average stay time of passengers, the average number of passengers on the station platform, and train capacity utilization. The simulation results demonstrated that the express train service significantly reduced the average stay time of passengers and the average number of passengers on the station platform, thereby alleviating congestion and improving passenger experience. Moreover, the capacity utilization of trains was improved, indicating a more efficient use of the available resources without the need for additional trains. Third, the study identified the alternative combinations of stations for inclusion in the express train route based on total foot traffic. By focusing on stations with the highest passenger volumes, the express service effectively balanced the demand between peak and lean periods, enhancing overall system efficiency. All the alternatives were proven to be more effective than the current system. The study recommends alternative 5 for having the highest utilization efficiency, which accounts for 67% of daily foot traffic. This option could also provide balance since more stations for the express service would also mean more costs to be incurred in the construction. The study recommends further investigating the cost considerations in detail by providing a feasibility study. In conclusion, the introduction of an express train service, as illustrated by the simulation model, offers a viable solution to the pressing issues of overcrowding and inefficiency in local train services. The MRT-3 management can refer to the study for considerations of the results and use the base simulation model in case other scenarios are preferred to be tested in the future. The methodology developed, which includes simulation modeling of introducing an express train route without buying new trains and a decision-making framework through considering foot traffic, 309","introducing an express train service to mass rail transit systems: a simulation-based approach for demand-driven station selection gabriel john l. de leon and luke michael i. cruz department of industrial engineering university of the philippines los baños (uplb) laguna, philippines gldeleon@up.edu.ph, licruz@up.edu.ph","References

To accurately measure the service life and evaluate the performance of the CSPs, three UoMs, i.e. 𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂, 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶, and 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸, were constructed and employed, the last one of which is firstly applied in RGA on CSP with the working mechanism informed, and thus can better measure the service life. Laplace Test indicated the decreasing trends of the failure rates of the CSPs during the impeller material transition at the 0.105 significance level. Two GoF hypothesis tests, i.e. CVM Test and CBH Test, validated that the failure and overhaul data of the five of six combinations between UoM and impeller fitted Power Law Model, which furtherly revealed the wear-out failure patterns of the CSPs, at the significance level of 0.2 and 0.1, respectively. Based on the adjusted Power Law parameters, economical life models were established to determine 𝑇𝑇𝑂𝑂 and 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑂𝑂 in the selected combinations, the overhaul policies based on which were simulated in the actual working scenario to identify the one offering the best cost optimization. Finally, it is recommended to implement the CSPs overhaul policy in the interval of 1.49E+05 (kw.h) by using the metal impeller and 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸 to minimize the total cost, i.e. achieving over 96.5% cost reduction compared to the existing eight-calendar-weeks overhaul policy with using both metal and rubber impeller. This study successfully validated the feasibility of conducting RGA based on the high-quality field data, and moreover can serve as a standard procedure and technical guide to widely conduct RGA on other critical repairable systems, such as conveyor belt, in processing plants for substantial cost reduction, which will not only revolutionise the existing Preventive Maintenance (PM) strategies and tactics on repairable systems in the processing plant, to furtherly lay a solid foundation for Preventive Maintenance Optimisation (PMO), but also work as one of two cornerstones or pillars in the best industrial practices in reliability engineering and asset health or management sector, including but not limited to Reliability Block Diagram (RBD), Fault Tree Analysis (FTA), Markov State Space (MSS) and Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS), and more importantly comply with the latest Australian Standard (AS) and International Standard (IS), i.e. AS/NZS IEC 61710:2020 and IEC 61710:2013, to furtherly unlock the hidden value of the existing assets. Future research should involve more data sets with larger scales and employ more localized UoMs strongly correlated to the most dominant failure modes, such as energy dissipation, the integral of thermal and vibration signals over time, to further improve the accuracy of RGA and thus reduce the total cost to the maximum extent. Moreover, detailed cost-benefit analysis and Life Cycle Cost (LCC) modeling should be conducted to further optimise the maintenance strategies of the CSPs.

In an effort to reduce these emissions, the government issued a policy MOA No. 38 of 2020 related to the ISPO (Indonesian Sustainable Palm Oil) standard. The Advanced Oxidation Process (AOP) Nanobubble method, which can oxidize various types of contaminants, is one of the alternatives for POME management. The feasibility analysis reveals that commercializing POME processing using AOP Nanobubble is viable, as evidenced by its NPV value of IDR 2,240,332,703, IRR of 65.85%, ROI of 64.22%, and payback period of 1 year and 4 months. Therefore, the palm oil industry can apply AOP Nanobubble technology to treat POME, anticipating a more efficient and eco-friendly wastewater treatment solution.","commercialization analysis of pome (palm oil mill effluent) with aop (advance oxidation process) nanobubble using business model canvas yasmin nur izzati, nararya rizqi alika and ershyanda khatayusha yunarzad prasetya department of ict business, faculty of economics and business telkom university, jl. telekomunikasi. 1, terusan buahbatu – bojongsoang telkom university, sukapura, kec. dayeuhkolot, kabupaten bandung, jawa barat, 40257 indonesia yasminizzati8@gmail.com , nararyaalika@gmail.com , ershyanda65@gmail.com",
52,3Rd Australian Conference On Industrial Engineering And Operations Management  Doi: 10.46254/Au03.20240120,"adaptive reuse of buildings plays a key role in achieving circularity in the built environment. despite the number of studies that focus on the adaptive reuse of built environments on different scales, a limited focus has been given to conceptualizing the adaptive reuse of buildings as a circular economy accelerator. it is important to grasp how adaptive reuse aligns with circular economy in built environment. as the first step, this paper reviews the existing body of knowledge on adaptive reuse buildings as a circular economy accelerator. this study employed the preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta-analysis (prisma) methodology to conduct the systematic literature review (slr). scopus and web of science databases were utilized to search articles, and 60 peer-reviewed journal articles published between 2013 and 2024 were retrieved for further analysis. descriptive analysis of selected studies revealed that the majority of the publications were from italy (25%). this study classified three key research themes based on extant literature: (1) policy and planning for adaptive reuse and circularity, (2) sustainability attributes for circularity, and (3) multi-criteria decision and evaluation tools for circularity. this study provides insight into how circularity can be integrated into adaptive reuse building projects. as an emerging field, findings herein are significant for academics and industry practitioners to broaden the knowledge of current status, research gaps and emerging trends on the adaptive reuse of buildings as a circular economy accelerator.","adaptability, adaptive reuse, buildings, built environment, construction","Adaptive reuse of buildings has been identified as a promising approach for promoting a circular economy in the built environment. This study has explored the emergence of literature on the adaptive reuse of buildings as a circular economy accelerator. PRISMA protocol was employed for article selection, and 60 peer-reviewed journal articles spanning from 2013 to 2024 were selected for the analysis. Descriptive and bibliometric analysis of selected articles discover the trends and key themes in extant literature. Globally, adaptive reuse is a growing concept in the built environment. However, it has been revealed that most of the research was carried out in Europe, which opens up the debate about the need for more research on adaptive reuse building projects to accelerate the circular economy in other regions of the world. The keyword co-occurrence network revealed three clusters, which denote key research themes in the adaptive reuse of buildings research from a circular economy perspective. These clusters are Cluster (1) Policy and Planning for Adaptive Reuse and Circularity, Cluster (2) Sustainability Attributes for Circularity, and Cluster (3) Multi-criteria Decision and Evaluation Tool for Circularity. This research contributes to the body of knowledge by providing a comprehensive overview of the current status of the research in the adaptive reuse of buildings from a circular economy perspective and provides valuable insight into adaptive reuse practices towards circular economy transition. The key research themes revealed in this study provide theoretical implications and future research directions. Accordingly, there are opportunities to develop future research on (1) developing policies and protocols to overcome barriers identified in these studies and for efficient transformation of adaptive reuse projects towards circularity, (2) integrating modern technologies and tools for achieving optimized circularity performance, (3) applying project planning approaches aside from disassembly sequence planning, (4) developing advanced approaches to verify the environmental and economic impact (5) simulating a regenerative capacity in order to achieve social sustainability and (6) establishing macro-level circularity indicators for adaptive reuse projects based on different geographical context. These observations can guide scholars, practitioners, and policymakers in understanding various aspects of the circular economy and promote adaptive reuse building projects as circular economy accelerators. This research has inherent limitations related to systematic literature reviews, such as being limited to two databases, Scopus and WOS.

This work proposed a framework with DPF as a solution to this challenge, fulfilling the stated research objective. The strategic depth of this approach is reinforced by the model’s implementation and validation, which paves the way for future developments, including the integration of real-time market data. Such expansion can significantly enhance the model’s predictive capabilities and its adaptability to dynamic market conditions. The preliminary outputs of the model serve as a platform for devising dynamic pricing strategies that encapsulate the true fair value of critical minerals extracted through diversified, sustainable practices. The model’s capacity for data integration positions it to conduct thorough assessments of ESG compliance and evaluate macroeconomic and geopolitical risks, emphasizing the strategic advantage of diverse sourcing methodologies.

56,3Rd Australian Conference On Industrial Engineering And Operations Management  Doi: 10.46254/Au03.20240124,"the automotive supply chain (asc) industries in south africa (sa) are thriving to eliminate the bottlenecks by implementing lean manufacturing (lm) techniques in the production line. the paper seeks to identify the bottlenecks by gemba walks and develop methods to eliminate the eight wastes using the theory of constrains (toc) and the strength, weakness, opportunities and threats (swot) analysis techniques. the bottleneck is exploited using the (toc), error proofing poka yoka and intelligent jidoka tools on the production machines. the use of green materials, trained personnel, good housekeeping, and inventory control together with a safe and health work environment increased throughput rates to meet customer needs and job satisfaction. the total productive maintenance (tpm) was used to correct the looming machine failure and improve the overall equipment effectiveness (oee). kew words bottlenecks, gemba, subordinate, elevate, standardize. 1. introduction 1.1 background of study companies that manufacture automotive parts are finding stiff global competition when it comes to strength, reliability, and quality of their products. this is worsened by another handicap, the bottleneck phenomenon that shrinks production and causes customer and worker dissatisfaction. the auto parts manufacturers supply popular automotive assembly companies namely nissan, ford, volkswagen (vw) and toyota that require thousands of auto parts for one model of a car. the parts are manufactured by different specialized companies and brought to the assemble line for assembly just in time (jit) to avoid build-up of bottleneck. a good and reliable supplier must deliver enough materials to be used per shift to the customer in time to reduce inventory. the supply of products from one production center is demanded by say four companies where manufacturing tools are not the same and need to 437",,"and Recommendations This section has conclusions and proposed recommendations for future use when applying the LM principles by academics and industry. This study showed that eliminating bottlenecks is critical to increase the throughput rate. Adopting LM improves the procurement of raw materials, personnel skills, housekeeping, equipment uptime, inventory control and provides a good health and safety environment for finished goods delivery to customers. A sustainable increase in productivity was driven by collaborating with all stakeholders. Good housekeeping is safe, fast and has no delays due to pileup. Trying to increase productivity on the back of employees posed costly safety problems hence the need to consult, involve and engage for any change in strategy to get their vital opinions. Sharing knowledge by providing training to collaborating companies and suppliers created a synergy for achieving the overall goals. Regular Value Stream Mapping (VSM) and Gemba walks uncover hidden bottlenecks that were remedied by a change in technology, manufacturing equipment, materials, or techniques to provide the highest value gain. Line balancing using the available resources offsets the bottlenecks. Investing in intelligent technologies such the Jidoka to sense a looming bottleneck is recommended for small auto parts. Automation has high repeatability and produces identical parts that have the same quality in terms of shape, size and finish. Most automatic machine tools have sensors that can detect a looming error and show by an amber light. When the error is not corrected the sensor will shut down the machine to prevent any rejections. Similarly, automation can self-adjust the speed, federate when there is an anomaly. For each machine standard operating conditions are developed, set, and adhered to by all machine operators. The standards will reduce the non-value adding processes like motion, transport and overprocessing. This will increase the OEE, productivity, job satisfaction and financial gains. 6.1 Recommendations for future use The study recommends frequent Gemba walk and VSM to identify the resources that cause a bottleneck.

The simulation results are confirming that the magnitude of the Boron diffusion profiles is decreasing with increasing texturing angles. The diffusion depths are also decreasing with increasing texturing angles. Therefore, the optical efficiency will be significantly impacted. The use of Pearson IV model in implantation and diffusion equations provided Boron diffusion profiles that are in good agreement with experimental profiles found in recent literature. We will study the impact of texturing with random pyramids on the diffusion of Boron in double- sided textured solar cells in our future work. 470",accurate modelling and simulation of boron diffusion in textured solar cells a. el boukili school of science and engineering al akhawayn university in ifrane morocco a.elboukili@aui.ma,"References

AI holds the promise of reshaping competitiveness, agility, and sustainability within manufacturing, yet its deployment remains uneven across different industry sectors. This disparity is exacerbated by high initial costs, technological readiness gaps, and organizational resistance to change, all of which hinder transformative outcomes. Moreover, leveraging AI effectively to enhance product design, cost optimization, and quality management necessitates overcoming logistical complexities and adapting swiftly to evolving market demands. Issues such as insufficient infrastructure support for AI deployment, cybersecurity risks, and ethical considerations further complicate implementation efforts. Additionally, disparities in digital literacy across workforce segments and the imperative for continuous upskilling present critical challenges as manufacturing enterprises endeavor to harness AI for improved inventory management, supply chain efficiency, and customer responsiveness. Addressing these multifaceted challenges is crucial to unlocking the full potential of digitization and AI in driving sustainable growth, innovation, and global competitiveness across the manufacturing sector.
