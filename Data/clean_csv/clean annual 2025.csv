However, taking S&P/BMV Total México ESG index, this relationship is not identified since 35 companies that compose this index, belong to different sector of activities and their relation is much niched by resource use system with short connectedness with at least one connection in average. Hence, in general the sustainability supply chain-based policy is not appropriate to induce sustainability in Mexico, however, Walmart and Chedraui S.A de CV can be good points to star with.

3,Doi: 10.46254/An15.20250015  Extending The Horizons Of Fmea: An Mcdm Approach,"failure mode effect analysis is popularly called as fmea. fmea is a pro-active tool to access potential failure modes and also evaluate the possible effects arising due to these failures. typically, a risk priority number (rpn), is evaluated for the identified failure modes. traditionally, this rpn is computed as the product of three values namely, severity, occurrence, and detectability. the range of this rpn value is from 1 up to 729. the rpn value helps the decision maker, prioritize the potential failure modes and take appropriate action/s to mitigate the risks. as rpn considers only severity, occurrence and detectability, there are chances that some significant criteria might be missed out or is not considered for evaluation. in this work we consider more than 21 criteria, which can help evaluate/quantify the potential failure modes. while, we do not claim that these criteria form an exhaustive list for the evaluation of failure modes, but will help provide a near holistic view of the problem at hand. with more than 21 criteria for performance evaluation, the rpn value will range from 1 up to 1.09419 x 1020. this is a very large number and will create computational complexities and hence very difficult to develop priorities of the failure modes. this will further have a cascading effect on developing potential strategies for mitigation of risks. here, we propose an approach to evaluate the modified rpn, by using mcdm technique/s. this approach will provide a realistic range of modified rpn, and hence help in proper evaluation of the potential failure modes. thus, this approach helps the decision maker to develop realistic strategies for mitigating risks. in this work, we not only enlist the different criteria for modified rpn evaluation, showcase the developed approach, but also illustrate the procedure with a hypothetical and real-life example. it can also be seen that, with minor modifications in the proposed procedure, this system fmea approach can be applied to process fmea as well. we hope that this work will help the decision makers make better and near holistic evaluation decisions.","fmea, mcdm approach. 29",,"prof. omkarprasad s vaidya indian institute of management, lucknow india osv@iiml.ac.in",
4,Doi: 10.46254/An15.20250011  A Mixed-Integer Programming Model For Supply Chain,"the supply chain network is a complex, interconnected system. any disruption in the flow of products or information within this network will have ripple effects, impacting other industries and partners in the supply chain. a disruption to one component of the network can lead to the isolation of certain industries. to analyze these impacts, a mixed- integer programming (mip) model is proposed. this model aims to measure the effects of disruptions on the flow of transactions between industries in saudi arabia, and how such disruptions affect the economic interdependencies across sectors. the study focuses on the 10 sectors most representative of the saudi arabian supply chain network. to evaluate the model's effectiveness, two different disruption scenarios were implemented. first, hundreds of random disruptions were generated, with one sector fully disrupted at a time. this allowed identification of the most vulnerable sector - sector 10. then, targeted disruptions were applied to specific sectors, and the results showed varying levels of impact on other affected sectors, demonstrating the complex, interdependent nature of the supply chain. this study highlights the significant impact that disruptions in one economic sector of the saudi arabian supply chain can have on other interconnected sectors, due to the high degree of interdependency within the network.","economic sector, interdependency","Disruption to any of the elements within the supply chain network, such as the nodes or transportation links, will influence the performance of many components of the supply chain network. This impact will not necessarily manifest as physical discontinuity, but rather as indirect constraints caused by the economic interdependencies that exist across the interconnected networks. In this study, the findings from the targeted and random disruption scenarios provide valuable insights into the vulnerabilities and interdependencies within the supply chain network of Saudi Arabia. The targeted disruption results demonstrate the strong connections between the Transportation Sector and the Agriculture and Chemical Products Sectors, highlighting the significant cascading impacts that can occur when these critical sectors are disrupted. Additionally, the analysis reveals the high dependency of the Food Products Sector on the Agriculture Sector, underscoring the need to address vulnerabilities in this area. The random disruption scenario further confirms the Transportation Sector as the most vulnerable economic sector, with its average performance dropping below 15% due to the disruptive impacts. These insights can inform the development of targeted strategies and policies to enhance the overall resilience and robustness of the supply chain network, ultimately improving the economic stability and sustainability of the region. By addressing the identified vulnerabilities and strengthening the interdependencies between sectors, supply chain managers and policymakers can better prepare the system to withstand and recover from potential disruptions, ensuring the continuous flow of goods and services within the Saudi Arabian economy. For future work, each sector should examine strategic approaches to expand and diversify their supplier base. This will help reduce the effects of interdependency and mitigate the risk of shortages in required elements during disruption events in any related sector. Additionally, due to the limitation in finding data for tangible products or commodities, the current model does not consider disruptions in the transportation system. Obtaining such data would improve the efficiency of the model, and the outcomes would be more beneficial for supply chain decision-makers.","resilience: identifying vulnerable sectors and interdependencies in saudi arabia mastoor m. abushaega department of industrial engineering, college of engineering and computer science, jazan university, jazan, kingdom of saudi arabia mabushaega@jazanu.edu.sa",
5,Doi: 10.46254/An15.20250017  Agent-Based Distributed Job Scheduling Algorithm,"present-day application of metaheuristic algorithms for job scheduling is highly centralized. however, the onset of industry 4.0 is rapidly changing the manufacturing paradigm from ‘centralized’ to ‘de-centralized’ production through technologies such as cyber-physical systems and industrial iot. this mandates a new generation of distributed methodologies to perform operations planning. thus, a novel decentralized algorithm, known as an agent-based job scheduling algorithm (abjs), is proposed in this work to perform the scheduling of jobs in a manufacturing flow shop environment. the problem of flow shop scheduling is solved by minimizing makespan under wide-ranging scenarios using machine agents and a scheduling agent. the abjs algorithm's superior performance for many jobs signifies its usefulness in real industrial applications.","scheduling, job sequencing. 30","This research proposes a decentralized algorithm for job scheduling in a manufacturing flow shop environment, treating the shop floor as a network of intelligent assets capable of autonomous decision-making. The problem of flow shop scheduling is addressed to minimize makespan. It is tested under various scenarios by varying three parameters: the number of jobs, the number of machines, and the variability in processing time for each job on each machine. Through simulations and evaluations, the algorithm has demonstrated comparable performance with established centralized algorithms, such as tabu search and hybrid genetic algorithm, for small problem sizes. Notably, its superior performance for a large number of jobs makes it a promising solution for real industrial scenarios. However, it is important to acknowledge certain limitations, such as for smaller problem size makespan obtained by ABJS are comparable to convention methods but the computational time may be more, due to agent to agent communication. Also, if any of the agents becomes inactive or fails to respond then the algorithm will not work. Several directions for further exploration are presented, including upgrading the optimization problem to be multi- objective by incorporating factors such as optimizing job holding time. Additionally, there is potential for expanding the scope of the algorithm by including more industrial agents, such as job agents, maintenance agents, inventory agents, etc., for more comprehensive agent-based distributed decision-making. Further improvements in the original algorithms are possible by exploring criteria to decide hyperparameters, for instance, determining the number of jobs shortlisted for each position as a function of the total idle time.

From the study results the following conclusions were drawn:  The bending posture is statistically significant difference between mortar spreading and bricklaying, while twisting body posture is insignificant with these task types.  The body postures (bending and twisting angles) were significantly different with four examined working heights during mortar spreading task. The outcomes revealed that higher working heights significantly reduced both bending and twisting angles of this task.  Bending posture was significantly different with four working heights in bricklaying task. In contrast, twisting posture was insignificant with different working heights during this task.  Bending angles were reduced due to increased working heights for both mortar spreading and bricklaying tasks, while twisting angles were not reduced significantly with higher heights during bricklaying task. This research found the significant impact of varying working heights on the bending and twisting postures during wall construction tasks. Consideration of working height in designing workstations, tools and equipment are recommended to minimize the risk of musculoskeletal problems in construction workers.","construction tasks: investigation of bending and twisting movements md. sumon rahman and tatsuru yazaki division of transdisciplinary sciences graduate school of frontier science initiative kanazawa university kakumamachi, kanazawa, japan rahman@stu.kanazawa-u.ac.jp, h299792@stu.kanazawa-u.ac.jp takanori chihara faculty of frontier engineering institute of science and engineering kanazawa university kakumamachi, kanazawa, japan chihara@staff.kanazawa-u.ac.jp jiro sakamoto professor, division of transdisciplinary sciences graduate school of frontier science initiative kanazawa university kakumamachi, kanazawa, japan sakamoto@se.kanazawa-u.ac.jp",

10,Doi: 10.46254/An15.20250023  Inventory Cost Management Analysis Using Order Quantity,"this study intends to evaluate the inventory strategy analysis of manufacturing firms, particularly applied steel product manufacturing companies engaged in manufacturing for the zinc or steel industry utilizing crc (cold rolled coil) in two countries in the asean region: thailand and indonesia. the sample companies in this study are companies producing applied steel products sized 020 x 914 x c (h) and 020 x 762 x c (h) in greater jakarta (jakarta, bekasi and tangerang) industrial area in indonesia and bangkok, thailand. the expected outcome of this study is that the determination of raw material control policies under the eoq (economic order quantity) approach is more optimal and efficient than the determination of raw material control using conventional methods. this study is using order quantity that includes the digital price setting to analyze the raw materials purchasing. it figures out how many orders are cost-effective for each order with a set frequency and when to reorder to minimize total inventory cost. thus, inventory efficiency runs well and an optimal number of ordering units can be achieved by keeping costs to a minimum. the results elucidate that, at a certain point, although the cost of salary is more expensive in thailand, 72",,"Based on the results of research on the application of EOQ (Economic Order Quantity) in inventory management in manufacturing companies in the Jakarta, Indonesia and Bangkok, Thailand areas and its effects, it can be concluded as follows: 1. According to research conducted on the reordering of CRC raw material inventories required by zinc and steel manufacturers in the Jakarta, Indonesia and Bangkok, Thailand regions, there is no significant difference in quantity. Particularly in Indonesia, certain types are considerably varied. 2. Poor inventory management causes frequent shortages and surpluses of critical raw materials (CRM) for Indonesia's zinc and metal manufacturers. In the case of a significant decline, safety stock can serve as a valuable safety net. 3. Inventory management of firms in Thailand is likely more efficient because internet costs are cheaper even though it has a higher speed than in Indonesia and affects order costs. Meanwhile, in Indonesia, manpower costs are less and affect storage costs. However, the storage cost component is greater in hoist and electricity costs than labor. If assumed to use digital warehousing equipment. 4. Based on the research conducted at a zinc and steel manufacturing company in Indonesia, it can be inferred that EOQ method is away more plausible than the conventional approach currently used. The EOQ method can effectively estimate future purchasing and reduce the risk of running out of CRC in both countries, Thailand and Indonesia.

12,Doi: 10.46254/An15.20250026  Scrum And Dmaic Integration,"most operational excellence corporate initiatives fail to yield the desired results: many organisations are struggling to turn their operational excellence efforts into a success, citing lack of leadership, changing business focus, internal resistance, and availability of resources as the main impeding factors. while a lot of focus is usually put on the technical side, the leadership, organisational and cultural impacts are often an afterthought, causing failure down the line. the design-measure-analyse-improve-control (dmaic) framework is the problem solving approach that has been at the core of the six sigma methodology since its inception, while scrum is among the most known and adopted agile methods, characterised by teams given significant authority and responsibility for many aspects of their work. although it may seem that dmaic and scrum tend to pull organisations in different directions, with scrum favouring flexibility and adaptability and dmaic favouring process standardisation instead, this conceptual paper shows the two methodologies and can work well together, proposes a practical framework for their integration, and defines the leadership’s traits needed for their successful integration.","agile, dmaic, leadership, lean six sigma","The purpose of this paper is to illustrate how Scrum and DMAIC methods can be integrated to benefit organisations: after illustrating their commonalities and differences, a practical framework intended for their integration has been presented, followed by the Leadership’s traits for a successful integration. This paper advances the literature on Operational Excellence in two practical ways: first, articulating the practical knowledge, artefacts, and tools where Scrum and DMAIC can came together, at each stage of a project, to facilitate the delivery of high-quality and customised products/services in the fastest time and at the lowest cost. A second practical contribution, in comparing the Leadership characteristics for Scrum and DMAIC, suggests there is an overlap, with two additional Leadership traits needed for Scrum deployments: the ability to empower self-organised teams and an iterative mind-set. As this was a conceptual paper, it needs to be empirically validated with research in the field, in order to build a systematic understanding of Scrum and DMAIC integration: a mixed method approach, combining qualitative and quantitative methods, is suggested, together with a case study of real application of DMAIC knowledge and tools into a Scrum project. Integrating Scrum and DMAIC may be a challenge for organisations that tend to compartmentalise knowledge, and professionals that have specialised in either one, requiring enlightened Leadership to balance among the speed of Scrum and the rigour of DMAIC, but the rewards will be the capability to adapt and adhere to constantly changing customer demands.","alessandro laureani independent lean six sigma scholar dublin, ireland alaureani@hotmail.com",
13,Doi: 10.46254/An15.20250034  Evaluating Sustainability Efficiency Of Alternative Fuel Buse,"this study evaluates the sustainability efficiency of alternative fuel buses within the public transportation system using an integrated model combining life cycle sustainability assessment (lcsa) with principal component analysis (pca) and data envelopment analysis (dea). this study evaluates six buses that run on diesel, electric, and compressed natural gas (cng) and are produced and recycled in different nations to comprehend the societal, economic, and environmental effects. with the aim of understanding their environmental, economic, and social impacts. thirteen sustainability indicators were assessed, including global warming potential (gwp), particulate matter formation (pmf), water consumption, and total tax. pca was used to reduce the complexity of these indicators, and dea was employed to assess the relative efficiency of each bus type by using the environmental impacts as inputs and the socioeconomic impacts as model outputs. the resulting sustainability scores were clustered into three categories: poor (3), fair (2), and excellent (1), reflecting the overall sustainability performance of each bus type. the clustering analysis revealed that cng buses from turkey recycled in china and india clustered as excellent and fair categories, with sustainability scores of 1 and 0.8798, respectively. due to their balanced environmental and economic profiles, while electric and diesel buses were clustered as poor, primarily due to high life cycle costs and greater 144",,"The study results show notable differences in the sustainability performance of alternative fuel buses according to the type of fuel, country of manufacture, and recycling location. The LCSA framework was enhanced with the combination of PCA and DEA to provide a comprehensive approach for evaluating the complex sustainability profiles of different bus types. Using thirteen sustainability parameters such as GWP, PMF, LCC, water consumption, human health impacts, employment, and compensation, the research evaluated three main fuel alternatives: CNG, diesel, and electric buses. In terms of life cycle impacts, the results show that CNG buses, especially those made in Turkey and recycled in China or India, consistently performed better than other bus types. Among all the analyzed buses, these had the lowest LCC and the fewest adverse effects on the environment in most categories. The great success of CNG buses is due to their lower pollution and lower operating costs, both of which make them much more environmentally friendly. The clustering investigation verified that CNG buses offered a good mix of environmental benefits and financial efficiency, as indicated by their high sustainability scores. Despite their low direct emissions, electric buses could have performed better in the sustainability assessment due to high life cycle costs and more significant resource consumption, particularly regarding water use and land footprint. This was consistent across manufacturing and recycling countries, highlighting that electric buses' current operational and production framework is not optimized for sustainable performance in Qatar. Their poor sustainability score is due to the energy mix situation in the operational country since natural gas is Qatar's primary electricity production source. Diesel buses, in contrast, were repeatedly identified as the most environmentally harmful alternative. They were the most inefficient and damaging to the environment, with the highest GWP, PMF, and water-related impacts, as well as significantly higher life cycle costs. The potential socioeconomic benefits of CNG buses outweigh the severe environmental impacts, even if diesel buses significantly influence employment and tax revenue. The study concludes that diesel buses should be replaced with more environmentally friendly ones. In summary, the results highlight that CNG buses are the most environmentally friendly and economically viable option for Qatar's public transportation system. While electric buses do less damage to the environment than traditional buses, they still need some work in production and operational efficiency by adopting renewable resources in electricity production. This research will be invaluable to policymakers as Qatar moves toward a more environmentally friendly public transportation system. Using a life cycle perspective provides a solid basis for comparing the sustainability of different transportation alternatives.","using life cycle sustainability assessment noura elagouz research assistant, qatar transportation and traffic safety center college of engineering, qatar university doha, qatar noura.elagouz@qu.edu.qa nuri onat associate professor, qatar transportation and traffic safety center college of engineering, qatar university doha, qatar onat@qu.edu.qa muhammet enis bulak assistant professor, department of industrial engineering, uskudar university istanbul, turkey muhammetenis.bulak@uskudar.edu.tr murat kucukvar associate professor, department of business ethics and legal studies, daniels college of business, university of denver denver, co, usa murat.kucukvar@du.edu",

15,Doi: 10.46254/An15.20250030  Enhancing Equipment Availability Through Lean-Tpm,"the global poultry processing industry faces significant challenges related to equipment availability, particularly due to insufficient maintenance practices. this study aimed to address these issues by integrating lean manufacturing and total productive maintenance (tpm) methodologies in a poultry processing plant. the main problem identified was frequent machine breakdowns, especially with the lincoln plucking machine, which caused over 30% of total downtime. to tackle this, the investigation applied a combination of autonomous and preventive maintenance, along with the implementation of a poka yoke device for optimizing rubber finger placement. the study resulted in a 6.81% increase in equipment availability and improved overall equipment effectiveness (oee) by reducing downtime and operational errors. these improvements had significant socio-economic impacts, decreasing costs and increasing production stability. this research highlights the effectiveness of lean-tpm integration in enhancing operational performance and calls for further exploration into automating other critical processes to achieve even greater efficiency.","lean manufacturing, poultry processing",". The study identified the primary causes of downtime in the poultry processing plant, with the Lincoln plucking machine being the most affected, accounting for 34.93% of total downtime in 2023. This downtime was primarily caused by frequent replacement of rubber fingers and feather accumulation, which together contributed to over 80% of machine stoppages. The proposed solution involved applying Lean and Total Productive Maintenance (TPM) tools, including Poka Yoke, autonomous maintenance, and preventive maintenance practices. These tools successfully addressed the root causes of the downtime, leading to measurable improvements in equipment availability and overall plant efficiency. The importance of this research lies in its contribution to addressing key operational challenges in the poultry processing industry. By enhancing machine availability, the plant's productivity increased significantly, reducing unplanned stoppages and ensuring smoother operations. The introduction of structured maintenance practices not only reduced machine failures but also fostered a culture of continuous improvement within the plant, positively impacting operational efficiency. This research contributed to the field of industrial engineering by integrating Lean Manufacturing and TPM principles in a poultry processing context, offering a novel approach to increasing machine availability. The use of Poka Yoke to reduce human errors in equipment handling and maintenance, combined with the autonomous maintenance practices that empowered operators to perform basic machine upkeep, provided a comprehensive strategy for improving operational performance. In conclusion, the study demonstrated that the Lean-TPM model was effective in reducing machine downtime and increasing equipment availability. However, further research could explore the integration of automation technologies in other areas of the poultry processing plant, such as the feather removal process, to further optimize operations. Additionally, refining the preventive maintenance schedule to address other recurring issues could lead to even greater improvements in plant efficiency. Continuous monitoring and adaptation of these strategies will be crucial for sustaining these improvements over time, ensuring long-term operational success.","integration: a case study of a poultry processing plant in peru dorita victoria aguilar-orbegoso bachelors in industrial engineering facultad de ingeniería, universidad de lima, perú 20163764@aloe.ulima.edu.pe yván jesús garcía-lopez research professor facultad de ingeniería, universidad de lima, perú ygarcia@ulima.edu.pe",

This study was conducted with data from ten sample developed countries, during the period between 2011 and 2020. The rate of economic growth is heavily influenced by technological progress. Technological advancement primarily refers to the development of new and improved production methods, as well as the upgrading of existing ones. The indiscriminate use of natural resources is the result of technological advancement. Technical advancements lead to increased productivity. The growth of economy in the developed countries is considered very much crucial because only when the developed countries do achieve the target in their economy’s growth, then these countries could lend a helping hand to developing countries. According to the study, the variables such as Carbon dioxide emissions, GDP per capita, industrialization, and population are all co-integrated, and with a long-run equilibrium relationship. Hence to minimize the rate of carbon emissions, the government should take appropriate measures. Since all four variables are co- integrated, reduction in carbon emission would increase the country’s GDP while industrialization would increase the rate of carbon emissions. The scope for further research is a comparative study, which can be done with other macroeconomic factors and economic growth on carbon emissions, with the help of renewable energy, financial sectors, and institutions. The same study can be used to investigate the relationship between regional- and sector-specific studies, as well as the same or different macroeconomic variables. Furthermore, the study can be used to predict future carbon emissions and greenhouse gas emissions over various periods using various analyses.","carbon emission in developed countries dr. s. vanitha professor and head, chair, school of business studies, department of commerce and financial studies, bharathidasan university, tiruchirappalli-620 024, tamil nadu, india vanitha@bdu.ac.in. n. thangaiyarkarasi ph.d.

20,Doi: 10.46254/An15.20250044  Optimizing Resilience: Facility Location And Fortification In,"in an increasingly interconnected global marketplace, the resilience of supply chains is crucial for ensuring the uninterrupted flow of goods and services. this paper addresses the reliable facility location problem (rflp) within a two-echelon supply chain network, focusing on the fortification of facilities to mitigate risks posed by potential disruptions. we model the decision-making process for locating and fortifying facilities at candidate sites, incorporating fixed location costs alongside two distinct fortification cost functions: linear and non-linear. the objective is to minimize total costs related to facility location, fortification, and transportation while ensuring that each customer is served by both a primary and a backup facility. the model with the linear fortification cost function employs a two-reliability framework, allowing for either fully fortified or unfortified facilities. in contrast, the non- linear fortification model introduces complexity by allowing for partial fortification, thus reflecting more realistic scenarios. both models are solved using a lagrange relaxation method, yielding near-optimal solutions. our findings emphasize the strategic importance of investing in facility fortification as a means of enhancing supply chain reliability and resilience against disruptions. this research contributes to the development of robust supply chain networks capable of navigating the complexities of modern logistical challenges, highlighting the need for effective strategies in facility location and risk management.","reliable, fortification",,"supply abdulrahman alenezi associate professor in industrial and management systems engineering college of engineering & petroleum, kuwait university kuwait abdul.alenzi@ku.edu.kw",

Specifically, the OTIF index, which reflects the percentage of orders delivered on time and in full, increased from 81.5% to 94.26%, representing a 15.66% improvement. Additionally, the procurement rate improved by 23.29%, and there was a notable reduction in product returns, decreasing by 41.18%. The analysis of root causes, followed by the introduction of standardized work procedures and error-proofing systems like Poka Yoke, contributed directly to these positive outcomes. This approach helped the company reduce dispatch times by 138 minutes, increasing operational efficiency by 40%. The importance of this research lies in addressing critical operational inefficiencies that negatively impacted the SME’s performance. The study highlights the significant role of Lean Six Sigma in streamlining logistics operations, which is crucial for pharmaceutical companies that operate in a highly competitive and regulated environment. The need for SMEs to adopt methodologies that ensure timely and accurate deliveries while maintaining quality is evident, given the industry's demands for efficiency and compliance with regulatory standards. This research contributes to the field of industrial engineering by demonstrating the applicability of Lean Six Sigma methodologies in pharmaceutical SMEs, an area often neglected in favor of larger enterprises. The combination of process improvement tools with Kotter's change management model ensures that these improvements are not only implemented but also sustained. The study provides a practical framework for SMEs in similar sectors to optimize their logistics operations and improve their competitive standing. Moreover, the integration of Poka Yoke and standardized work serves as an effective method to reduce human error and enhance consistency in the logistics process. Future studies should explore the long-term sustainability of the improvements achieved in this research, particularly focusing on the scalability of Lean Six Sigma in other areas of the supply chain beyond logistics. Additionally, research could investigate the integration of advanced digital technologies, such as automation and artificial intelligence, into Lean methodologies to further enhance process optimization in pharmaceutical SMEs. This would allow companies to remain competitive in an evolving market that increasingly demands both efficiency and innovation.","change management to improve logistics performance: a peruvian pharmaceutical sme case study xiomi alexandra maldonado-condezo bachelors in industrial engineering facultad de ingeniería, universidad de lima, perú 20162225@aloe.ulima.edu.pe angie margoth quispe-palacin bachelors in industrial engineering facultad de ingeniería, universidad de lima, perú 20161178@aloe.ulima.edu.pe alberto enrique flores-pérez research professor facultad de ingeniería, universidad de lima, perú alflores@ulima.edu.pe",

The results of the empirical study demonstrated the practical feasibility of the proposed approach, filling a gap in preventive maintenance for the build-up process in IC substrate production. An empirical study conducted at a leading IC substrate manufacturing company in Mainland China further validated the solution. First, a checklist of decision elements, combined with domain knowledge, was used to clarify the existing maintenance issues of the stripping machine and to identify key features. Second, XGBoost hyperparameters were optimized using BOA, where the surrogate model was iteratively refined by incorporating all observations of the target function. This process enabled the XGBoost model to better approximate optimal hyperparameter settings, resulting in improved performance and enhanced robustness in varying conditions and data complexities. The proposed framework addresses common features that can be applied to various processes and industries. The empirical study on the vertical stripping machine in IC substrate manufacturing has demonstrated the practical feasibility of this approach, supporting smart manufacturing initiatives and advancing Industry 3.5. Proper threshold settings are essential to accurately detect changes in machine conditions. Future research should focus on continuously collecting new data to increase the sample size and incrementally update the training dataset. This approach will help maintain model effectiveness, enhance decision agility, and improve the quality of on-site maintenance decisions.

By applying unsupervised learning methods, the autoencoder model demonstrated outstanding performance in detecting anomalies in equipment operations, effectively identifying abnormal situations. Additionally, the health score transformation model quantified the health status of the equipment. The application of optimized machine scheduling algorithms further enhanced the system's energy efficiency, achieving the goal of reducing energy consumption and operational costs. The key outcomes of this research include:  Anomaly Detection: Utilizing the autoencoder model, the system successfully detected anomalies in unlabeled data and quantified equipment status through health scores.  Data Preprocessing: The deseasonalization process effectively eliminated the impact of seasonal fluctuations on the data, improving model accuracy.  Energy Efficiency Optimization: Through Principal Component Regression and the Random Search Algorithm, the machine fleet scheduling was optimized, significantly reducing energy consumption.  User Interface Design: A health score dashboard UI was implemented, allowing users to monitor equipment status and system energy consumption in real-time. 283","maintenance and optimal configuration of air compressors in the semiconductor industry tai-ching hung master student at department of industrial engineering and engineering management national tsing hua university, hsinchu, taiwan, roc eddy112034558@gapp.nthu.edu.tw kuo-hao chang professor at department of industrial engineering and engineering management national tsing hua university, hsinchu, taiwan, and deputy director at national science and technology center for disaster reduction, taiwan, roc chang@mx.nthu.edu.tw jing-wei chen researcher at industrial technology research institute, hsinchu, taiwan, roc jingweichen@itri.org.tw jing-yao jhang researcher at industrial technology research institute, hsinchu, taiwan, roc itrib20638@itri.org.tw","References

47,Doi: 10.46254/An15.20250086  A Comparative Study On The Performance Of Order Release,"scheduling plays a vital role in optimizing the performance of wafer fabrication facilities. order release control (orc) policy is a key scheduling component, as it determines the type, quantity, and timing of new orders released into the system. over the years, several orc policies have been developed specifically for semiconductor wafer fabrication. evaluating these policies for their performance efficiency is essential, as it provides valuable decision support for practitioners. this paper compares the performance of 17 existing orc policies designed for semiconductor wafer fabrication facilities, focusing on three due date-based performance measures: with the objective of minimizing total weighted earliness/lateness (twe/l) and total weighted tardiness (twt) and maximizing the on-time delivery (otd) rate. the mimac test bed dataset, also known as the mini fab or intel mini fab, is used to develop the simulation model of wafer fabrication, and simulation experiments are conducted using arena simulation software. the simulation results reveal that the work-in-process load control (wiplctrl) policy is the best-performing policy for minimizing twe/l, while the parametric workload regulating (pwr) policy is the best- performing policy for each of the minimizing twt and maximizing otd rate. it appears that no single orc policy emerged as the best-performing policy across all three performance measures. therefore, an average ranking approach is employed to assess the overall effectiveness of each policy. the final rankings identify starvation avoidance (sa), constant work-in-process (conwip), and revised conwip (rconwip) as the best-performing policies, while total cycle time (total_ct) and constant load (conload) are the worst-performing.","intel mini fab, simulation model","This study conducted simulation experiments to analyze the due date-based performance impact of ORC policies on the semiconductor wafer fabrication facility. A total of 17 ORC policies were evaluated, involving CONWIP, SA, WR, DEC, CONLOAD, PWR, TOTAL_CT, FRCP, DRCP, RCONWIP, Droll, EWIP, WIPLCtrl, EWC, CONSTWL, CONSTBWL, and SWC. Simulation results were discussed based on the three due date-based performance measures: TWE/L, TWT and OTD rate. The best-performing ORC policies were identified for each of the three performance measures, and their improvements over the other policies were evaluated. WIPLCtrl was the best-performing policy for the TWE/L measure, while the PWR policy emerged as the best-performing policy for both the TWT and OTD rate. The performance analyses revealed that no single ORC policy consistently outperformed others across all the three due date-based performance measures considered. Due to this, the average ranking of each ORC policy over the three due date-based performance measures was calculated to determine the overall best- and worst-performing policies. Accordingly, it was identified that policies like SA, CONWIP, and RCONWIP were the best-performing policies across all three performance measures, demonstrating their effectiveness in achieving balanced outcomes. Further, TOTAL_CT and CONLOAD were identified as the worst-performing policies. This study focused solely on ORC policies, while other shop floor control strategies, such as dispatching control, also play a crucial role in wafer fabrication. Evaluating ORC policies in integration with dispatching rules when applied to the wafer fab's different workstations, like lithography and diffusion furnace workstations, would offer a more comprehensive analysis of shop floor control strategies in wafer fabrication.","control policies in semiconductor wafer fabrication facility – a simulation approach ragupathi t and mathirajan m department of management studies indian institute of science bangalore 560012 ragupathit@iisc.ac.in, msdmathi@iisc.ac.in",

49,Doi: 10.46254/An15.20250069  Integrating Robotic Process Automation In Healthcare:,"robotic process automation (rpa) is software-based robotics which automates and offloads unnecessary processes performed by human workers. rpa was introduced by hospital x primarily to support the operations team in making informed decisions about procurement as well as to notify vendors to bill for the consumed items. before the implementation, the process was straightforward but tedious. after implementation, the process was considerably shortened. instead of manually tracking and informing individual vendors, staff could simply submit a report to the rpa bot. however, inefficiencies remained in the procurement process. in this paper, we identify the operational inefficiencies that arise from rpa implementation using lean six sigma methodology. we map the current and to-be process and brainstormed for improvements. finally, we compare the advantages and disadvantages of manual processes versus rpa to determine which one is more superior and analyzed the time savings from implementing rpa. rpa essentially automates some of the most mundane and repetitive computer-based tasks and processes in the workplace. it promises to boost efficiency by taking over tasks that were previously handled by humans. this paper contributes to the extant literature on rpa implementation and how lean six sigma and dmaic methodology helped hospital x to transition from manual to automated process and improve its procurement process.","lean six sigma, healthcare, procurement","and Recommendations 5.1 Conclusions This study aimed to evaluate the post-implementation efficiency of Robotic Process Automation (RPA), identify areas for improvement, and compare the performance of manual processes with RPA. • Objective 1 sought to assess whether the RPA system effectively streamlined processes and reduced workload. The findings revealed that the current RPA implementation fell short of expectations, failing to achieve significant workload alleviation. • Objective 2 focused on identifying solutions to overcome the challenges and limitations observed post-RPA deployment. To achieve the desired outcomes, the study explored opportunities for enhancing the RPA system and proposed a training plan tailored to address the specific needs of the nursing team. • Objective 3 compared the strengths and weaknesses of the manual process and RPA. Surprisingly, the manual process proved more effective in its current state, as the RPA system failed to deliver the anticipated workload reductions. Unlike artificial intelligence, RPA lacks adaptive learning capabilities. Its rigidity, while limiting in some aspects, also ensures it processes data according to predefined standards - a characteristic that can be advantageous with appropriate enhancements. 5.2 Recommendations To improve the current system, key recommendations include: • Modifying the RPA system to provide informed procurement decisions based on usage balance and accurate purchase order identification. • Ensuring continuous system operability to avoid delays in procurement decision-making and invoice processing timelines. Proactive maintenance by Tech Company “S” is critical to preventing unplanned downtime. • One major limitation of RPA is that it requires human initiation in certain steps due to security constraints. Excessive human intervention, however, has hindered the system’s ability to achieve its full potential. Eliminating unnecessary user involvement is essential for maximizing efficiency. To address this, it is crucial to ensure the information in charge forms is accurate, complete, and consistent with data in Epic. Once a successful match is established between charge forms and Epic, the RPA system can generate and submit reports autonomously. • A verification layer within the Hospital X database can safeguard data accuracy, eliminating the need for manual checks, modifications, and reconciliations. This improvement will enhance process efficiency, reduce workload stress, and ensure the RPA system fulfills its intended purpose.","challenges and opportunities jalene ng chu lin, miti garg and tan yan weng logistics and supply chain management programme school of business, singapore university of social sciences singapore jaleneng001@suss.edu.sg, mitigarg001@suss.edu.sg, ywtan@suss.edu.sg",

The study's findings underscore a 59% reduction in mold change time, achieved by systematically identifying and transforming non-value-added (NVA) activities into more streamlined processes, resulting in a decrease in both the number of operational steps (from 20 to 14) and movement distance (from 272.76 meters to 133.16 meters). This level of improvement directly translates to higher production capacity, reduced machine downtime, and cost savings, which are critical factors for competitiveness in the automotive manufacturing sector. A key outcome of this study is the demonstration of SMED's effectiveness in converting internal setup tasks to external ones, allowing for a more seamless operation with less interruption to machine utilization. Integrating ECRS (Eliminate, Combine, Rearrange, Simplify) principles further optimized these setups by reducing redundant activities and reordering steps to maximize efficiency. For instance, combining temperature stabilization tasks with other setup activities effectively minimized idle time without compromising quality. The findings of this research not only offer immediate practical applications for rubber injection molding in the automotive industry but suggest broader implications. The methodologies outlined could be adapted for other complex manufacturing setups requiring frequent changeovers or equipment adjustments. Additionally, this study advocates for a proactive approach to continuous improvement, emphasizing that investments in advanced technologies (such as preheating stations) and well-structured training for staff can yield sustainable benefits. 516","molding for automotive suspension components using smed and lean manufacturing techniques wichian jueram systems engineering program, school of industrial engineering suranaree university of technology nakhon ratchasima, thailand. wichian.jueram@gmail.com jongkol srithorn school of industrial engineering suranaree university of technology nakhon ratchasima, thailand. jongkol@sut.ac.th","References

The findings reveal that the implementation of the proposed TPM-based maintenance model significantly improved operational efficiency and equipment reliability. Through the structured approach, the case study demonstrated a 13.85% increase in operational efficiency and a 25.58% reduction in non-conforming products, highlighting the model’s effectiveness in enhancing production processes. The autonomous and planned maintenance strategies were particularly impactful, empowering operators to take ownership of routine maintenance tasks while introducing a systematic framework for preventive actions. These improvements collectively contributed to a more reliable production environment and greater alignment with industry standards. The importance of this research lies in its focus on addressing specific operational inefficiencies prevalent in the battery manufacturing sector. By adapting Total Productive Maintenance (TPM) principles to the unique requirements of small and medium-sized enterprises, the study offers a practical solution to persistent issues such as high downtime and quality deviations. The findings underscore the relevance of autonomous and planned maintenance as effective methodologies for sustaining operational gains and ensuring long-term stability. Moreover, this research underscores the value of employee involvement in maintenance activities, which not only enhances equipment reliability but also fosters a proactive and engaged workforce, crucial for achieving sustained improvements in a competitive market. This research contributes to the field by filling a critical gap in the literature regarding the application of TPM methodologies in small and medium-sized battery manufacturers. Existing studies often focus on large-scale organizations or more established industries, leaving a void in understanding how these maintenance strategies can be adapted for smaller enterprises with limited resources. The study’s contributions lie in demonstrating how TPM tools can be tailored to fit the operational and financial constraints of SMEs while delivering significant improvements in key performance indicators. By providing a scalable framework that integrates autonomous and planned maintenance, this research offers valuable insights for other SMEs in the automotive sector facing similar challenges in maintaining production efficiency and quality standards. The findings and methodologies discussed in this study lead to several key observations and recommendations for future research. First, the successful implementation of the TPM-based model suggests that small and medium-sized manufacturers can achieve substantial gains by adopting structured maintenance approaches. However, it is essential to emphasize the role of continuous training and capacity building in sustaining these improvements over time. Without ongoing employee engagement and periodic reviews of maintenance practices, the initial gains may not be maintained. Future studies should explore ways to enhance the model’s adaptability to other manufacturing contexts, focusing on sectors with similar operational constraints and challenges. Additionally, the study highlights the need for more comprehensive metrics to assess maintenance effectiveness beyond traditional indicators such as operational efficiency and availability rates. The inclusion of metrics related to sustainability and resource utilization could provide a more holistic view of the model’s impact. Moreover, further research could investigate the integration of advanced digital tools, such as predictive maintenance algorithms and real-time monitoring systems, to enhance the proactive maintenance capabilities of the model. Such advancements would not only improve the accuracy of maintenance interventions but also align the model with current trends in Industry 4.0 and smart manufacturing. In conclusion, this study presents a robust framework for improving the operational efficiency of small and medium- sized automotive battery manufacturers through the tailored application of Total Productive Maintenance principles. The findings indicate that adopting autonomous and planned maintenance strategies can significantly reduce equipment downtime and enhance product quality, thereby boosting competitiveness in an increasingly demanding market. While the proposed model has shown promising results in the case study, its broader applicability to other SMEs in the automotive sector and beyond remains an area for further exploration. Researchers and practitioners are encouraged to build upon this study by refining the model and exploring its potential to drive sustainable improvements in different manufacturing contexts. 492","in automotive battery smes: a case study in peru herzan antonio lino-uribe bachelors in industrial engineering facultad de ingeniería, universidad de lima, perú 20090616@aloe.ulima.edu.pe lucy stephanie schultz-lajo bachelors in industrial engineering facultad de ingeniería, universidad de lima, perú 20153333@aloe.ulima.edu.pe alberto enrique flores-pérez research professor facultad de ingeniería, universidad de lima, perú alflores@ulima.edu.pe","References

This improvement will be optimized if they provide the shop floor workers with a smart board to enter and organize their work. Smart boards help in dealing with dynamic environments like shop floors where unnecessary stops may occur and delay the production process. Most of the workers in the company complain about the amount of paper they make, so switching to paperless will be a big advantage to them. However, some of the workers still believe that paper is essential, and they cannot deal with computerized systems for work. Resistance to change exists in their workers, and special training is required to ensure smooth transition to paperless.

The project utilized Systematic Layout Planning (SLP) and simulations with Flexsim Healthcare to create and evaluate three layout alternatives for the temporary operating room. Results indicated that Layout Alternatives A and c had comparable efficiency, with both reducing unnecessary travel and workflow delays. However, Layout Alternative A was recommended due to practical constraints, such as limited staff availability, structural considerations, and budgetary restrictions. The proposed Layout met performance standards without requiring significant engineering modifications, thus ensuring efficient use of resources. The post-occupancy evaluations, conducted one month after the Layout's implementation, demonstrated that environmental conditions, including temperature, humidity, and air pressure, met WHO standards. Additionally, no pathogen growth was detected, confirming good air quality in the operating room. User satisfaction was also high, with an overall satisfaction level of 88.88% for Layout a, highlighting the Layout's suitability for efficient and safe operations.

Conclusion This paper highlights the current state and challenges of implementing Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) solutions in SME´s in Germany. Despite its potential, the implementation level remains very low due to limited investment in IIoT-related research and development, driven by an imbalanced cost-benefit ratio. Internally, top management, IT, and sales teams act as key supporters, while external drivers are shaped by market trends, profitability, and availability. However, a significant obstacle lies in the digital infrastructure, where the abundance of diverse IIoT solutions leads to compatibility and integration challenges. IIoT offers promising opportunities, such as cost reduction and enhanced transparency in customer relationships, but it also faces various challenges. These include a lack of collaboration on the shopfloor, organizational hurdles like demographic changes and knowledge gaps, and difficulties in selecting suitable IIoT platform providers. To address these issues, several measures are recommended, including political support through simplified funding models, organizational initiatives like fostering innovation circles and training employees, and technological advancements focusing on the standardization of interfaces. In conclusion, unlocking the potential of IIoT requires coordinated efforts across political, organizational, and technological domains to overcome existing barriers and drive adoption.

In the case of using IoT data with AI-driven predictive models, some advantages were observed in both, the ability to predict and the system performance. After a large number of experiments, LSTM model beat the benchmarks like Rule based system, Decision tree, Random Forest in terms of precision, recall, F1-score, accuracy etc. In particular, the LSTM model provided the accuracy of 97. 5%, precision of 95. 3%, recall of 93. This was followed by a precision of 95%, recall of 94% and an F1-score of 2%. 2 percent, so it can be considered as a very effective instrument for the predictive maintenance in industrial conditions. The comparative analysis showed that the traditional approaches were unable to handle long-term dependency in time series data which is very much essential in the industrial systems. The LSTM model was able to have a better performance in terms of time and accuracy when it comes to predicting system failures because of the memory units that is inherent to the model. This capability led to better operation efficiency with a decrease of downtime with 30% compared to 15% in conventional methods. The LSTM framework also resulted in significant improvement in the reduction of maintenance cost, which was cut by 25%. 4%, as well as response time that was enhanced from 250ms to 100ms proving the usefulness of real-time decision making. Furthermore, the LSTM model has been tested for various industrial applications and the generalization between the training and testing datasets suggest that it has the potential of being implemented in other fields. The proposed framework has a significant amount of operational advantages in that it decreases the probability of system failures and consequently decreases the costs of potential system downtimes; especially in industries where predictive maintenance is crucial for maintaining constant operations and cost effectiveness.","framework for enhanced decision-making in industrial automation abdullah alghuried assistant professor, department of industrial engineering, faculty of engineering, university of tabuk saudi arabia aalghuried@ut.edu.sa",

The company faced a shortfall in production of up to 53%, largely due to a calculation method that was not aligned with real-world conditions, leading to inaccurate values for the production capacity and cycle time. This issue was attributed to the variations in components used for the different wheelchair models. With a focus on Model A, it was found that the initial calculation of 55 wheelchairs per hour was an overestimate, with the actual output being 35 units per hour. To address this problem, ECRS principles were applied to reduce bottlenecks and inefficiencies in the process, and Excel VBA was used to standardize the time calculations. Moreover, simulation techniques were applied to statistically analyze and compare data with real system metrics. A data validation process showed a normal distribution with a P-value exceeding 0.05, and performance indicators showed that the percentage relative difference (real vs. simulation) had a minimal deviation, aligning with the initial assumptions. A new capacity model was developed, resulting in a production capacity of 46 wheelchairs per hour post-line balancing. This optimization led to a 31.43% increase in capacity and improved the line efficiency from 64.70% to 107.65%. As a result, the company’s income increased from 455,000 baht per hour to 598,000 baht per hour, a gain of 143,000 baht.","efficiency for a wheelchair assembly process: a case study pharunya phonin, supasak eiamsaard, dawan worasan and nara samattapapong school of industrial engineering, institute of engineering, suranaree university of technology, thailand, 30000 nara@sut.ac.th thatsani yaemmanat division of student affairs, suranaree university of technology, thailand, 30000 thatsani.yaem@sut.ac.th vicharinee sawasdee and wichuda mingsakul department of digital technology and media convergence and department of logistics technology, faculty of social technology, rajamangala university of technology tawan- ok, chanthaburi, thailand, 22210 vicharinee_sa@rmutto.ac.th, wichuda_mi@rmutto.ac.th",

Current lighting, noise, temperature control, spatial layout, and furniture arrangements at the nurse stations significantly differ from established ergonomic standards. Low lighting in some parts of the hospital makes it difficult to perform specific tasks; high noise levels, fluctuating temperatures, lack of space, and inadequate furniture design lead to physical stress, reduced work output, and a higher likelihood of MSDs among nursing professionals. Improvements in lighting intensity, noise reduction measures, temperature stability, adjustable furniture, and optimized workstation layouts are all recommended to address these issues. These changes would go beyond improving the comfort and efficiency of the nurses to benefit patient care by making the nurses' work safer and more effective. Hospitals that ergonomically align nurse stations will reduce occupational health risks to workers and promote increased job satisfaction among healthcare workers. Ultimately, this commitment to ergonomic improvements will help grow a healthy, safe, and productive work culture for staff and patients in the long run.","philippine tertiary-care hospital adriana feliz l. yap-eo, chelsea ann c. boado, justine renzo o. rivera and eliezer jethro d. torrecer students, industrial engineering school of engineering and architecture, saint louis university-baguio city philippines 2226568@slu.edu.ph, 2004600@slu.edu.ph, 2220472@slu.edu.ph, 2213617@slu.edu.ph michelle s. cariño-adiwang professor and head, industrial engineering school of engineering and architecture, saint louis university-baguio city, philippines mcadiwang@slu.edu.ph",
90,Doi: 10.46254/An15.20250166  Study Of Information And Communication Technology With,"advanced technical solutions known as ""smart warehousing systems"" use a variety of automation components to boost warehouse efficiency and accuracy. modern technologies like artificial intelligence, machine learning, edge computing, and the internet of things (iot) have the potential to improve smart warehouse operations by boosting output, lowering errors, and boosting efficiency. as the demand for prompt and effective order fulfillment increases, businesses are turning to smart warehouse solutions to boost overall efficiency and streamline processes. due to the exponential growth of data generated in modern warehousing processing, cloud-edge-terminal (cet) computing— which represents a paradigm shift in the way data is processed and managed, particularly in the context of the internet of things (iot)—has become the dominant trend for warehousing information technology. in order to maximize cloud-edge-terminal computing speed, data compression is essential. in situations where bandwidth is scarce and data redundancy is high, edge devices can preprocess data by compressing it before transmission, which not only lowers the volume of data transmitted over the network but also improves the effectiveness of data processing in the cloud. particularly in mission-critical applications, the use of sophisticated compression methods can greatly reduce the data footprint while guaranteeing the preservation of important information. the main objective of this study is to examine the test bed for a smart warehousing system, particularly for e-fulfillment centers, using databases, sensors, communication protocols, and generally accessible development platforms. the smart warehousing system's information and communication technology (ict) will be examined, with a focus on areas like computation, data transfer, and imaging processing that might profit from data compression. the results have several ramifications: they can be used to develop ict for smes using easily accessible technologies, establish a paradigm for future research into the smart warehousing system, and enhance ict performance in general, including data processing and transfer in smart warehousing environments.","internet of things, edge computing, taiwan",,"edge computing in the smart warehousing system gary yu-hsin chen department of logistics management national kaohsiung university of science and technology kaohsiung 82445, taiwan garychen@nkust.edu.tw ping-shun chen department of industrial and systems engineering chung yuan christian university chung li 32087, taiwan pingshun@cycu.edu.tw",

The results showed that a 4-year training period produced the best ROC-AUC value. However, no specific trends were observed between the length of the training period and the detection accuracy for other durations. For PR-AUC and Recall@k, all classification models showed the lowest values when the training period was set to 3 years, indicating that detection accuracy may decrease when the training period is too short. In contrast, extending the training period improved the PR-AUC and Recall@k for certain lengths, which varied 773","accounting fraud detection models natsuki sato phd student, course of engineering graduate school of engineering, kanagawa university kanagawa, japan r202370185cu@jindai.jp ayuko komura assistant professor, department of industrial engineering and management kanagawa university kanagawa, japan komura-a@kanagawa-u.ac.jp hirohisa hirai professor, department of industrial engineering and management kanagawa university kanagawa, japan hirai@kanagawa-u.ac.jp","References

Predictive maintenance as an Industry 4.0 development. The core areas are easily limited by the process of accumulating data over a long period of time, making it difficult to obtain enough data for effective predictive analysis and model building in the early stages. At the same time, equipment maintenance data may contain sensitive business information, making companies reluctant to share it with other companies. The federated predictive maintenance architecture constructed in this study hopes to use the advantages of federated learning to allow multiple clients to collaboratively train models without sharing data to solve data privacy and sharing issues, and benefit from the historical experience of other clients to improve model performance. The results validated the efficacy of the proposed federated learning framework in addressing predictive maintenance challenges. Key findings include 1) Federated learning enhances predictive accuracy by integrating insights from multiple clients. 2) The federated model maintains high performance even with limited training data per client. 3) The federated model is resilient to reductions in client participation during training. 4) The federated model demonstrates strong generalization to new, unseen data. Based on these findings, the framework's ability to balance data privacy, efficiency, and model performance underscores its suitability for real-world smart manufacturing deployments. In future work, federated predictive maintenance will not only require continued improvements in predictive model performance. It is necessary to consider the communication costs caused by information exchange during the aggregation process of the model, and reduce unnecessary information transmission to improve communication efficiency. In addition, the collaborative process of federated learning is vulnerable to attacks by malicious participants or tampering with information, leading to system paralysis or errors. Therefore, the implementation of strong security protection mechanisms such as encryption technology is also one of the important tasks in the future. Through these efforts, the practical application value of federated learning can be further enhanced and ensure its widespread application in the field of smart manufacturing.","federated learning chao-lung yang, hwai-chen qiu and cheng-ye yang graduate institute of intelligent manufacturing technology national taiwan university of science and technology (ntust) taipei, taiwan clyang@mail.ntust.edu.tw, d11251004@mail.ntust.edu.tw, m11101t07@mail.ntust.edu.tw",

101,Doi: 10.46254/An15.20250190  Logistics Optimization For The Use Of Solid Urban Waste As,"the cement industry is a significant contributor to global carbon dioxide (co₂) emissions. to reduce these emissions, the industry is increasingly utilizing municipal solid waste (msw) and turning it into refuse-derived fuel (rdf) as an alternative fuel source in cement kilns. this initiative not only seeks to reduce the need for traditional fossil fuels but also addresses critical waste management challenges. this paper develops a mixed integer programming (mip) model to optimize the cost-benefit ratio associated with processing, transporting, and utilizing msw as fuel across multiple cement plants. the model aims to minimize logistics costs while addressing the complexities of waste processing and transportation, offering a systematic approach to decision-making. the collaboration with a cement company, which receives urban waste from the government for use as fuel, highlights the importance of efficient operations. while the plants have the capacity to process the waste, logistics have historically been managed manually. to improve efficiency, a mathematical model was created to minimize both logistics costs and co₂ emissions through deterministic multi-objective optimization. 865",,"With increasing concerns about achieving sustainability in highly polluting industries like cement manufacturing, it becomes crucial to incorporate these aspects into daily operations. Moreover, implementing semi-automated decision- making processes is essential for companies with complex operations, as finding optimal solutions without optimization tools can be extremely challenging. This is particularly relevant when evaluating economic and environmental impacts in scenarios involving numerous variables. In this study, a mathematical model was developed to address both economic and environmental factors. A significant focus was placed on the practical application of the research, analyzing a cement company's operations and its integration of circular economy principles by repurposing waste as an alternative fuel. Key findings from the model's use and validation include the following: - The model effectively reduces costs, demonstrating that a well-optimized process with designated software could lower operational expenses compared to current practices. This was especially true when RDF plants operated at a higher utilization. - The optimization of the current operation successfully reduces the CO₂ emissions throughout the complete process, highlighting the environmental benefits of these practices. - The model´s results indicate that under current constraints, CO₂ emissions are not highly sensitive to the optimization process, so the primary focus should remain on minimizing costs, as this approach has the biggest impact. - Validation results showed that the model’s results were consistent with actual outcomes but with higher efficiency. For example, the model’s optimization in transportation and processing capacities led the company to reduce the number of trucks required, which translates to significant cost savings and improved resource utilization.

This study aims to prototype a highly effective data-driven DNN-based approach for early detection of power theft and electrical anomalies in the new generation telecommunications base stations. Random Forest emerged as the most reliable model in terms of accuracy across all outlier levels, while DNN showed competitive performance with lower RMSE in noisier datasets than logistic regression. Logistic regression, being a simpler model, struggled with the complexity introduced by outliers. The study highlights the importance of the selection of electrical theft and anomaly detection models based on the characteristics of the dataset, and underscores the potential benefits of hybrid models and advanced preprocessing techniques. Future work can focus on optimizing these approaches and exploring new methodologies to further enhance model robustness and accuracy.","detection of electricity theft and anomalies in 4g and 5g telecommunications base stations malebo l.g maboko m.sc (eng) student school of mechanical, industrial, and aeronautical engineering university of the witwatersrand (wits) johannesburg, south africa 672871@students.wits.ac.za mncedisi dewa, ph.d. senior lecturer school of mechanical, industrial and aeronautical engineering university of the witwatersrand (wits) johannesburg, south africa mncedisi.dewa@.wits.ac.za",
106,Doi: 10.46254/An15.20250206  Assessing The Challenges And Opportunities For Blockchain,"shipping companies have played a significant role during the covid-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdowns. however, they face challenges in terms of data visibility and transparency within the complex shipping network. this paper conducts a systemic review of the challenges including real-time visibility issues, fragmented data, limited information sharing, complex regulations, cybersecurity risks, lack of standardized processes and technologies, and trust issues. this paper also details the explored solutions to resolve the challenges and details the trending technologies evaluated for adoption. this paper uses the prisma technique to explore the challenges and blockchain adoption in the supply chain industry. qualitative content analysis is performed on the collected articles. the paper extensively discusses the integration of blockchain technology into current research solutions, encompassing conceptual models and real-life case studies. furthermore, these articles provide insight into the inherent constraints of existing frameworks and assist in pinpointing areas that can be addressed through the implementation of the new blockchain framework which seems to be missing from the existing literature. this paper will be a valuable input for future researchers as it summarized the existing technologies and implementations. research gaps identified in the existing market will be helpful for future research to resolve the industry challenges.","transparency, data visibility, challenges","On performing a systemic review of the challenges with the shipping supply chain, it is evident that transparency and data visibility have been major concerns in the industry. It also exposes the issues with a lack of transparency in the shipping supply chain. The existing research papers present gaps like low precision, cost, and compatibility in existing frameworks and technologies which results in non-transparency. Few of the researchers went the extra mile to find various solutions that will help resolve the transparency issue and increase data visibility across the transitions of the goods from origin to destination. It is evident that most of the findings revolve around utilizing new technology to overcome the associated challenges. Researchers explored different technologies like Barcode, NFC, GPS/GIS, WSN, RFID, IoT and Blockchain, and a few of them explored the combination of technologies to design a solution for transparency issues. Blockchain has proven to be a robust and effective framework and has positive characteristics. Hence much of the focus was on exploring its potential in this area which benefits the industry in adopting. There are surveys that expose the interest rate in adopting the blockchain into the supply chain. Some articles have even conducted thorough analyses of various solutions and frameworks which adds more value to Blockchain adoption. Though there are many processes to be adopted by the supply chain industry to improve transparency, the industry is still lacking with demonstratable or adaptable framework. It is evident that none of these research papers presented a functional prototype or framework specifically tailored for the shipping supply chain in recent years. Considering the complexity of the shipping supply chain, the development and implementation of a new technology or framework in the Shipping industry is always problematic and has budget constraints. A prototyped application or a framework could help the industry in trailing Blockchain adoption to resolve transparency issues. Understanding that the existing research papers haven’t provided a working prototype, the future work of this research naturally shifted towards embracing blockchain adoption as a viable solution and developing a blockchain-based application that can be adopted by the Shipping industry. Conducting interviews with industry experts will help gather more information that can be used as inputs for framework development or enhancement. Evaluating the developed framework could be the future research path to enhance the transparency and visibility of data.","adoption: a systematic review of the shipping supply chain deepa parthiban research higher degree student, school of engineering & technology central queensland university, sydney, australia deepa.parthiban@cqumail.com srimannarayana grandhi associate professor, school of engineering & technology central queensland university, melbourne, australia s.grandhi@cqu.edu.au wei li senior lecturer, school of engineering & technology central queensland university, rockhampton, australia w.li@cqu.edu.au",

The literature review also discusses the current method of identifying unpaid superannuation and the implementation of blockchain technology as a remedy for superannuation payment fraud. This research-in-progress paper presented the literature review results. However, blockchain application is yet to be presented to demonstrate its suitability in preventing superannuation fraud. As this study used the Australian Superannuation problem as a case, this concept will therefore be restricted to the Australian business environment. In conclusion, the proposed solution will be useful in determining whether the superannuation contribution was successful when using dependable and durable technology like blockchain.

The manual system was exposed to issues such as human errors, material damage, methodological inefficiencies, equipment shortages, and environmental concerns. These challenges necessitated a shift to a more reliable and efficient system. In the “Plan” phase, the team identified the key issues and developed a comprehensive strategy to address them. The “Do” phase involved implementing a digital registration system using Microsoft Excel, integrating it with existing laboratory instruments, and conducting extensive staff training. Pilot testing and feedback collection were crucial in refining the system before full-scale implementation. The “Check” phase focused on evaluating the system’s performance through data analysis, user feedback, and comparison with industry benchmarks. This evaluation helped identify successes and areas for further improvement. Finally, in the “Act” phase, the team standardized the new processes, rolled out the system across the laboratory, and established continuous training and feedback mechanisms to ensure ongoing improvement. The adoption of the digital registration system has led to significant improvements in data accuracy, turnaround time, and user satisfaction. By standardizing processes and incorporating continuous feedback, CAL has created a more efficient and user-friendly sample registration process by standardising processes and incorporating continuous feedback. This transition not only enhances operational efficiency but also aligns with the organization’s sustainability goals, contributing to cost savings and corporate social responsibility. The Value-Added Time (VAT) was reduced by 57.47% from 151.32 minutes to 64.35 minutes and the Non-Value-Added Time (NVAT) by 99.96% from 2643.18 minutes to 0.92 minutes. CAL enhanced percentage process efficiency from 5.41% to 98.59%. Physical activity also has been removed, saving time, decreasing strain, increasing accuracy, boosting accessibility, simplifying procedures, and promoting sustainability. Through the adoption of the Kaizen mindset, CAL is committed to implementing lean operating principles. Ongoing discussions with JPG’s Digital Division team aim to enhance the sample registration system to new levels. Additionally, discussions have begun on developing an in-house Laboratory Information System (LIS). This new system will be integrated with existing ecosystems, such as SAP S/4HANA (financial planning, budgeting, and reporting), SAP Ariba (purchasing and contract management), and KPlant (operation data platform), among others. This initiative highlights CAL’s and JPG’s commitment to continuous improvement and operational excellence. Overall, the successful implementation of the digital registration system at CAL demonstrates the importance of embracing digital transformation in modern laboratories. It highlights the benefits of systematic planning, thorough evaluation, and continuous improvement in achieving long-term operational excellence.

The results show: The degree of human-machine collaboration has a significant impact on situational awareness. Initially, more automation boosts situational awareness but further increases in automation lead to a decline. This implies excessive reliance on automation can harm an individual's task environment awareness. There is a remarkable correlation between the degree of human-machine collaboration and trust and acceptance levels. As automation grows, individuals' trust and acceptance of automated systems increase, suggesting higher automation may enhance users' trust and receptivity. With the increase in the degree of human-machine collaboration, the overall performance of the subjects improves significantly. 1031","degree on situational awareness and trust within the context of automation technology xiaofang yuan school of management, xi’an university of science and technology, xi’an 710054, china yxf@xust.edu.cn kexin han school of management, xi’an university of science and technology, xi’an 710054, china 15590679443@163.com","References

119,Doi: 10.46254/An15.20250225  A Study Of The Effect Of Multi-Page Display On Search,"to explore a more reasonable way of displaying information on the page of the vdt control system, the way of displaying information on the page is the object of study, and it is divided into three types of pages according to different types of information display, which are: complete page, information-graded page, and block-separated page. this paper adopts a combination of subjective evaluation (scale data: nasa tlx scale) and objective evaluation (behavioral data, physiological data: eeg, eye movement) to compare the reaction time, correct rate, cognitive load, and cerebral load of the subjects when they perform target search on the three types of pages, and concludes that the use of information-graded pages is the most effective, followed by complete pages, and the effect of the page with separate blocks of diagrams is less effective. the results of the study suggest that either the full page or the information-graded page can be used when designing the page, both of which can ensure high search efficiency and at the same time enable the manipulator to maintain relatively low cognitive and mental load and reduce human errors. the results of the study can provide a certain reference basis for the optimization of information presentation in vdt control systems.","multiple pages, search efficiency","This paper presents an exploratory study on page display in VDT control systems. The aim is to investigate the relationship between the manipulator's search efficiency and the way pages are displayed in VDT control systems. The study draws the following conclusions. In a VDT control system, complete information is displayed on a single page when space permits. Although the manipulator is presented with a large amount of information, familiarity with the page increases over time, leading to improved search efficiency and reduced cognitive load. The increase in pages for the information-graded page did not reduce the total amount of information. Categorizing the information on different pages was an improvement in search efficiency based on behavioral data. Based on the eye-movement and EEG data, it can be concluded that compared to the other two display methods, the cognitive and brain load on the manipulator is lower when the information-graded page is used. Therefore, the information-graded page is the most effective display method among the three. Based on the feedback from the subjects, the block separation page is impractical and difficult to use. Based on the information provided on the block separation page, it appears that this page may not be ideal to create informational target search tasks. Instead, it may be better suited to display graphic or icon search tasks. Further investigation is recommended. In summary, when designing the page for a VDT control system, one can either concentrate all the information on a single page or integrate and design information with a large amount of data and regular type of information as a information-graded page. Both of these pages can ensure high search efficiency, enable the user to maintain a low cognitive and brain load, reduce human error and improve work efficiency.","efficiency in vdt control systems xin-yi zhang graduate student,school of management, xi’an university of science and technology, xi’an 710054, china lin-hui sun professor, college of safety science and engineering,school of management, xi’an university of science and technology, xi’an 710054, china",
120,"Doi: 10.46254/An15.20250226  Integrating Smed, Preventive Maintenance, And","the low productivity levels in the metalworking industry, particularly in casual and small industries, are often attributed to the long times it takes to carry out a changeover, the recurrent machine downtime as well as overexertion of rework tasks. prior research studies undertaken have shown the usefulness of lean manufacturing tools such as smed, regular maintenance and formatted work in eliminating such wastages. hence, this study sought out to solve these issues by looking at the design and application of a new production model in a chrome roller making sme. some of these included employing smed, so as to reduce changeover processes; great or increased reliability of equipment through preventive maintenance; and the reduction of operational variability through standardized operating procedures. the results obtained were significant change; a 22.9% reduction in change over time, a 65.4% reduction in rework and a massive 76.4% reduction in machine downtime which resulted into a 30.9% increase in productivity levels. these findings demonstrate the feasibility of the model to be effectively employed for improvement of other business parameters in a company. further studies that incorporate complex technologies are welcomed, aimed at developing effective and unique solutions for different manufacturing environments.","productivity, standardized work, productivity","This research reveals that substantially increased productivity and operational effectiveness were achieved as a result of the introduction of the SMED, the preventive maintenance programs and the standardized work practices in one of the metalworking SMEs. These measures tackled the significant challenges of long changeover times, machine breakdowns and high rework levels. Among the notable improvements were a reduction in changeover time from 429 to 331 minutes, in rework time from 179 to 62 minutes and equipment downtime due to breakdowns from 246 to 58 minutes. Besides, productivity registered a marked improvement as the time needed to produce the chrome-plated roller was minimized from 25.25 to 17.45 hours. These improvements indeed attested to the potential of the proposed production model in improving resource and process reliability. The findings bring to the fore the need to embed the application of lean tools within the operational setting of SMEs, especially in diverse and complex environments. Through process rationalization and the culturing of continuous improvement, the author shows how such measures can turn operational problems into growth opportunities. Emphasis on application and provision of workers with standardized methods not only minimized the chances of errors but optimized their flexibility and willingness to meet greater production targets. Such an all-rounded view ‘operationalizes’ the dichotomy between abstract models and their actual use in everyday life, thus reaffirming the practicality of lean approach in pursuit of excellence in operations. Looked at more broadly, the results are of great importance to the branch of industrial engineering as they serve as a distinct evidence-based literature on the impact of lean type production tools in a small-scale manufacturing context. The research strengthens the need for SMED and standardized work as fundamental of being able to respond quickly and effectively to changes while avoiding unnecessary work that adds no value. In addition, the preventive maintenance program enhances continuous operational integrity by mitigating unforeseen downtimes, reducing maintenance expenses in the end and increasing the operational life period of significant assets. Such insights are critical for industry and researchers in a bid to make SMEs enhance their productivity and competitiveness in such environments. Reliably, the publication presents a well-structured theory that can be modified and used in different industries to combat the challenges that impede productivity. Further studies could look into the possibility of including more cutting-edge technologies like IoT based predictive maintenance or predictive simulation-based maintenance software to increase the range of these activities. Also, longitudinal studies focusing on the sustainability and the possibility for the further commercialization of the used tools would help to better understand their benefits over time. In those relationships between the business activities and institutions further development of lean practices can be expected which would guarantee constant enhancement in the ever-changing environment of the manufacturing sphere. 1060","standardized work practices: a study of productivity gains in metalworking smes sebastian gabriel condeso-rossiter bachelor in industrial engineering faculty of engineering, university of lima, peru 20192630@aloe.ulima.edu.pe jorge axl javier moreno-arce bachelor in industrial engineering faculty of engineering, university of lima, peru 20193125@aloe.ulima.edu.pe juan carlos quiroz-flores research professor faculty of engineering, university of lima, peru jcquiroz@ulima.edu.pe","References

By integrating data analysis, queuing theory, simulation, and machine learning, the project addresses inefficiencies in traditional queue systems, such as prolonged waiting times and resource misallocation. The study utilized data from the airport, including passenger arrival patterns, service times, and queue lengths. Simulation techniques ensured the realism of the data, and a machine learning model was developed to predict waiting times based on key parameters like queue count and service times. The results demonstrate that peak congestion occurs between 12:00-18:00 and 18:00-24:00, with waiting times correlating directly with queue size. The machine learning model achieved an accuracy of 88%, effectively predicting waiting times in most cases, though some deviations were observed for higher durations. By implementing this smart queue management system, the airport could significantly reduce waiting times, optimize resource allocation, and improve passenger satisfaction. Real-time queue updates, priority-based scheduling, and adaptive allocation of resources are some of the key features that enhance operational efficiency. Furthermore, the proposed system is scalable and adaptable to other airports, providing a long-term, sustainable solution to queue management challenges. Future work aims to further enhance the model accuracy and scope of the proposed system, making it adaptable to different environments with further refinement to enhance efficiency and customer experience in high-demand environments.","airport security checkpoints for bagging inspection waad mubarak alshahrani, sara osama sallam, maymona awn abdullah and raneem abdulaziz alshahrani undergraduate students, industrial engineering department king khalid university abha, saudi arabia waadmubaraka@gmail.com, sara.sallam123s@gmail.com, maymonah.awn@outlook.com, raneemazalshahrani@gmail.com mohammed al awadh assistant professors, industrial engineering department king khalid university abha, saudi arabia mohalawadh@kku.edu.sa",

Despite the existing gaps and variance between ICT deployment in Africa and the rest of the world, there is need for Africa to fully embrace ICT and the fruits that come with it. Engineering professionals are the heartbeat of this dream and we should be number one on the list. Incorporation of ICT in engineering designs as demonstrated above will yield optimum results and will save the client some significant costs. Engineers should embrace ICT in all their designs for the benefit of Africa and the entire world. This paper recommends the use of ICT in all engineering designs especially in modern day designs of green buildings. The paper also calls upon the nations and the entire world to close all the existing gaps in the ICT sectors despite the milestones made. This will lay down a solid foundation for enhanced application of ICT in economic recovery, Growth and combating effects of climate change as well as any unforeseen pandemic(like COVID 19) that may arise in the future. The simulation results above were able to bring out the visualization of how technology will be used in energy management system and parking system. The results have demonstrated the important role played by ICT in running systems. Further exploration of the study can be enhanced to include various aspects of the systems especially uncertainties and unreliability in mains power supply, system maintenance and increased load demand. 1112","driver towards post pandemic economic recovery and growth in africa- milestones and challenges joel nadebu ouma senior superintending engineer state department for public works nairobi (kenya) p.o. box 41191 – 00100 nairobi, kenya joelnadebu@gmail.com","References

A reduction of more than 30% in preparation times was obtained, achieving a better order delivery time to customers. This reduction contributed to a significant improvement in operational efficiency, reflected in an increase in customer satisfaction by receiving a better level of delivery service. On the other hand, the validation of the improvements through simulations demonstrated the viability and sustainability of the changes made, which allows to anticipate and mitigate possible inconveniences before their actual implementation. Thanks to this improvement, the reduction of delivery times allows to meet around 50 % more than the current demand, according to the simulation in Arena. These results confirm that the combination of standardization and SLP tools presents an effective approach for operational improvement in fast food restaurants, establishing a more robust business model, capable of meeting increasing customer demands without compromising quality and efficiency, and positioning the restaurant favorably in a competitive environment.","restaurant through standardization and slp berenice olenka arce guzmán and nicole alejandra ríos villegas universidad de lima, facultad de ingeniería lima, perú 20193797@aloe.ulima.edu.pe, 20194509@aloe.ulima.edu.pe josé antonio taquía gutiérrez universidad de lima, facultad de ingeniería lima, perú jtaquia@ulima.edu.pe",

The implementation of traceability leads to greater procurement efficiency and optimization. By digitizing procurement processes, organizations can better manage supply chain risks, improve transparency, and foster stronger and more sustainable relationships with suppliers. Qualitative impacts, such as improved risk management, increased supplier accountability, and better decision making, help companies achieve their sustainability goals while maintaining a robust procurement strategy. This study will help procurement to focus more on value-added activities to achieve cost efficiency, budget control, and sustainability. The revamp of procurement procedures aims to increase efficiency, improve compliance, and align the procurement processes with sustainability goals. This revamp focuses on modifying the ordering threshold flow and leveraging digitalization to optimize procurement sustainability. While the findings offer valuable insights, this study acknowledges several limitations. First, this study examines a single case study of PT XYZ, which limits the generalizability of the findings to other industries with different procurement regulations and challenges. Second, this study focuses on short-term efficiency gains instead of long- term sustainability impacts of digital transformation, such as supplier resiliency or carbon footprint reduction. Future studies could enhance the findings by longitudinally examining the impact of digital transformation on more comprehensive sustainability performance metrics.","digitalization transformation towards sustainability evi rahayu izzah and erlinda nusron yunus sekolah tinggi manajemen ppm jakarta, indonesia erl@ppm-manajemen.ac.id",

144,Doi: 10.46254/An15.20250261  Role Of Religiosity And Subjective Norms In Forming Social,"this study investigates the differential impact of intrinsic and extrinsic religiosity on an individual’s intention to start a social enterprise through subjective norms. even though entrepreneurs have started exploring the role of religion in starting a social enterprise, research has yet to examine how different religious motivational dimensions — intrinsic and extrinsic religiosity — might influence one’s social entrepreneurial intention. using structural equation modelling on a valid sample of 210 respondents from india, results show that extrinsic religiosity positively influences social entrepreneurial intention via subjective norms. however, intrinsic or extrinsic religiosity does not directly influence social entrepreneurial intention. our model indicates that individuals’ intention to start a social enterprise partly depends on their extrinsic religiosity and subjective norms. our findings present interesting theoretical implications for social entrepreneurship literature and practical implications for organizations that seek to promote entrepreneurship. 1250",,"The main goal of this research is to explore and predict social entrepreneurial intention, focusing on two motivational aspects of religiosity—intrinsic and extrinsic—as well as subjective norms. The proposed model demonstrated a good fit. Among the five hypotheses tested, only two were not supported, while the remaining three received strong support. This research has theoretical and pragmatic implications too. First, it shows that extrinsically motivated religious individuals adhere to subjective norms related to social entrepreneurship and are more prone to start a social enterprise. Second, we provide an empirical contribution by testing our model in an Eastern context that includes an understudied country, such as India, with a focus on non-Abrahamic religious affiliations. Thus, we add to the very limited literature on religion and entrepreneurship, which has focused on Western developed countries with their dominant religion as Christianity (Rietveld and Hoogendoorn, 2022). Third, this paper, with its multi-focus on intrinsic and extrinsic religiosity and subjective norms, fulfils the calls of past researchers to consider multiple psychological determinants simultaneously to develop a holistic and deeper understanding of social entrepreneurial intentions (Balog et al., 2014).

By employing process mining techniques, we identified prolonged promotion timelines for women and Mizrahi faculty, demonstrating the utility of innovative analytical tools in uncovering hidden disparities. The research successfully met all its objectives, including the development of a novel database, dynamic dashboards, and an equality index to evaluate diversity within academic institutions. The project achieved its primary goal of creating a robust platform for data collection and analysis. This platform integrates a comprehensive database with dimension and fact tables, designed to support future expansions to include additional institutions. Using the Celonis software, we developed an interactive dashboard capable of detailed, real- time analysis of promotion processes, facilitating the identification of gaps and opportunities for equity improvements. A key outcome of this work is the development of an equality index that compares the demographic composition of academic staff with the broader workforce. This tool provides academic institutions with actionable insights to assess and enhance their diversity efforts. It also offers a comparative framework for tracking progress toward inclusivity at both institutional and national levels. While this study is limited to data from two institutions—Ben-Gurion University and Sapir Academic College—it establishes a scalable foundation for future research. Expanding the database to include more institutions will enable broader evaluations of diversity in Israeli academia, contributing to the development of national strategies for equity and inclusion. The tools, insights, and indices generated by this research offer significant potential for driving institutional reforms and fostering a more inclusive academic environment. By addressing the disparities identified, academic institutions can enhance fairness, support underrepresented groups, and strengthen the broader academic community.","career progression sagit kedem-yemini logistics department sapir academic college sderot, israel sagity@mail.sapir.ac.il sigal nagar-ron and tammy razi multi-disciplinary studies sapir academic college sderot, israel sigalro@sapir.ac.il, tamarr@sapir.ac.il",

149,Doi: 10.46254/An15.20250276  Evaluating Manufacturing Systems Effectiveness,"this paper evaluates the effectiveness of manufacturing systems operating under random failures and quality disturbances. each manufactured part was inspected to be good or non-conforming. the non-conforming parts can be scrapped or reworked, considering its implications on system effectiveness. three quality strategies are considered depending on specific industrial contexts: 1- reworking non-conforming parts until they meet specifications, 2- reworking parts with the possibility of scrapping them, and 3- scrapping parts even when they could be reworked. to analyze and evaluate the dynamic and stochastic behavior of these manufacturing systems, the paper presents analytical formulations based on a markov chain approach. simulation models replicating the real dynamic and stochastic behavior of these production systems were developed to validate the accuracy of the proposed analytical formulations. finally, comparative studies, based on system effectiveness and economic aspects, were carried out between these considered quality strategies.","random failure, scrap-rework, markov chain","This study evaluated the effectiveness of unreliable manufacturing systems by examining different approaches considering quality issues, including rework and scrap. A new Markov chain model was proposed to assess the system effectiveness where non-conforming parts are scrapped even when rework is possible. This model was validated through comparison with simulation results. The proposed approach is also compared against strategies that prioritize rework. The results reveal that systems employing rework consistently outperform those relying solely on scrap in terms of effectiveness, regardless of the quality parameters α and β. Interestingly, under certain conditions, the rework-with- scrap approach exhibited effectiveness levels comparable to the scrap-only strategy. Although rework theoretically offers significant advantages in terms of effectiveness, it also incurs additional costs that, in some cases, may exceed the costs associated with rejection of non-compliant products. These findings highlight the need to align the chosen approach with the specific objectives of the manufacturing system, whether it is to maximize effectiveness or optimize costs. Future research could delve deeper into the cost implications of these strategies and expand the models to address more complex production environments, including multi-products, multi-machines, and buffer stocks. Adding environmental considerations could further enhance the models by addressing sustainability challenges, balancing resource use and material consumption, and reducing emissions. This aligns global sustainability goals and promotes eco-efficient manufacturing systems.","under random failures and quality disturbances amel hajji riftsi laboratory, ensit, university of tunis, tunis, tunisia industrial engineering department, enit, university of tunis el manar, tunis, tunisia amel.hajji.12@gmail.com karem dhouib riftsi laboratory, ensit, university of tunis, tunis, tunisia karemdhouib@yahoo.fr ali gharbi c2sp laboratory, école de technologies supérieure (éts), montréal, canada ali.gharbi@etsmtl.ca.",

The 5S methodology, by encouraging cleanliness and order, contributes to an appropriate organization of the workspace, resulting in a significant reduction in idle times and errors during storage and picking processes. Additionally, the optimized layout proposed through the SLP approach reduces product transfer times to the picking area, thereby increasing daily dispatch productivity. Adopting a continuous maintenance plan based on the TPM approach improves the availability of machinery, such as packaging machines and transfer equipment, by reducing failures and operational errors while fostering a preventive maintenance culture that ensures long-term operational sustainability. These results align with findings reported in specialized literature, validating the initial proposal, and reinforcing the effectiveness of this integrated approach to improving warehouse management.

154,Doi: 10.46254/An15.20250281  Skills Development To Reduce Process Improvement Failures,"process improvement is a critical endeavor for organizations seeking to achieve sustainable performance in today's competitive market. however, a high failure rate of about two-thirds of process improvement projects remains a significant concern, negatively affecting organizational resources and undermining performance. leadership emerges as one of the most vital factors influencing the success or failure of these initiatives. this study explores the role of leadership in contributing to process improvement project failures and highlights the technical and non-technical skills essential for reducing such failures. to achieve this objective, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 12 process improvement practitioners from the manufacturing and service sectors. the findings reveal key leadership roles in failures, including lack of interest and support, ineffective communication, poor understanding of team dynamics, and inappropriate leadership styles. additionally, the study identifies skills such as statistical analysis, structured problem-solving, communication, adaptability, and emotional intelligence, which are critical to driving process improvement teams toward success. organizations can use the insights from this study to assess the competencies of their process improvement teams and design skills development training programs to bridge any gaps, focusing on the specific skills needed for successful improvement outcomes.","process improvement, lean six sigma, leadership, skills development","This study highlights the critical role of leadership in shaping the success or failure of process improvement projects. The findings highlight several leadership deficiencies contributing to failure, including lack of active involvement and visible support, misalignment of process improvement initiatives with organizational strategy, and insufficient alignment of process improvement and long-term goals. This aligns with (Antony et al., 2022; Bader et al., 2023), who identify such deficiencies as critical failure factors. Inadequate communication and a failure to empower teams were identified as critical leadership shortcomings that undermine motivation, creativity, and accountability. Hence, effective leadership extends beyond simply guiding teams; it involves aligning organizational priorities, fostering collaboration between operational and improvement teams, and ensuring sustained interest in process improvement initiatives. Leaders need to adapt their leadership styles according to the situations and challenges they face. This underscores the need for leaders to be dynamic, aware, and responsive, ensuring their approach aligns with both the immediate challenges and long-term objectives of their organization. To address these challenges, the study emphasizes developing technical skills such as statistical analysis and problem- solving and non-technical skills such as communication, collaboration, and team building for effective process improvement implementations in accordance with (Netland, 2016). Still, our findings underscore a shift towards more holistic, adaptable, and people-centric skills in process improvement roles. The study emphasizes the importance of understanding the specific industry in which process improvement project is applied to tailor the methodologies to the unique challenges and processes within a sector. Proficiency in software tools like Minitab and SPSS is essential for data-driven decision-making, allowing practitioners to conduct advanced statistical analysis, monitor process performance, and generate actionable insights to drive improvements. As process improvement projects often involve uncertainty, the ability to assess, mitigate, and manage risks is becoming increasingly important to anticipate potential issues, create contingency plans, and minimize the impact of unforeseen challenges. Adaptability is crucial in today’s fast-paced business environment. A mindset of continuous learning is essential for both personal and organizational growth. Process improvement practitioners must be committed to staying updated on new methodologies, tools, and best practices to drive ongoing process improvements and ensure long-term success. Beyond problem-solving, practitioners need the ability to think critically and innovatively. This allows them to approach complex challenges from multiple angles, find creative solutions, and drive forward-thinking improvements. This study serves as part of a larger effort to address process improvement project failures, contributing to the broader field by offering insights into the intricate relationship between leadership and project success. By integrating these findings, organizations can focus on equipping leaders with the necessary competencies to overcome common failure factors, enhance team performance, and achieve sustainable improvements. However, the study’s findings are based on qualitative data from interviews that are subjective and may reflect participant biases.

demands to remain competitive in the market. This study offers valuable insights for businesses, enabling them to 
comprehend the prevailing consumer preference for upcoming trends. Specific strategies are therefore recommended: 
• 
Adoption of E-wallets by these micro enterprises to reduce dependencies on the cash payments, hence 
improving financial tracking and transparency and to ensure adoption, cash back strategies should be offered 
to entice new users. 
• 
Leverage on E-wallet features such as QR codes to simplify payments by printing and displaying cards at the 
counter for easy access and payment. 
• 
Transaction history should be leveraged to improve and/or streamline financial tracking, specifically the cash 
flow and inventory tracking. This can be worked side-by-side with various analytics platforms, for easy 
analysis of operations and sales of these micro enterprises. 
• 
Another key feature that can be maximized is the In-App marketing tool dedicated to businesses, helping 
these micro enterprises to optimize sales activities by leveraging discounts, cashbacks, as well as push 
notifications for proactive promotion. 
 
Strategic Framework for Policymakers: 
Given the findings, both the national and local governments should spearhead the task of E-wallets integration by 
these micro enterprises to ensure the attainment of high scale adoption by society, attaining a digital society. Specific 
strategies are therefore recommended: 
• 
Strategic implementation of tax incentives to the micro enterprises who will integrate E-wallets into their 
system. This requires the help of the Business Processing and Licensing Office (BPLO) by actively 
monitoring these micro enterprises.  
• 
Government agencies and arms such as BLPO, Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), and other bureaus 
under the Department of Finance (DOF), should spearhead the task of organizing regular webinars and 
workshops, aimed at promoting digital financial literacy and inclusion, to ensure the widespread adoption of 
E-wallets from both the businesses and the consumers. 
 
Roadblocks Mitigation Recommendations: 
The goal of this recommendation is to improve the level of trust as well as digital literacy, pivotal in reinforcing the 
adoption rate of E-wallets. 
• 
Overcoming Cost Barriers:  
o 
Consortium should be made between the fintech firms digital payment providers to offer fee waivers 
such as transfer fees for first few quarters for MSME who integrated the E-Wallet for the first time.  
o 
Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) and the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) should provide 
incentives and subsidies such as transaction volume-based tax rebates for the MSMEs, specifically 
in the form of refundable tax credits which depend on the volume of digital transactions by these 
businesses.  
• 
Security & Fraud Prevention:  
o 
Launch monthly webinars to improve the digital literacy of both MSMEs and consumers, regarding 
the most common as well as new fraud schemes such as phishing via SMS high-jacking, and fake 
payment confirmations which can be mobilized primarily by the Department of Information and 
Communications Technology (DICT). 
o 
Implement a dedicated fraud support helpline by institutionalizing a 24/7 fraud hotline to cater to 
the specialized needs of MSMEs. This will allow the businesses to promptly report suspicious and/ 
or anomalous transactions. This will potentially increase the consumers’ confidence in using the 
digital payment platforms. 
As a direction for future research, this study can serve as a valuable resource for future researchers seeking to 
advance the understanding and development of e-wallet use in various enterprises, including Small Enterprises, 
Medium Enterprises, or MSMEs in general. Future researchers may consider examining the potential benefits of 
increasing the sample size and focus their research on alternative regions within the Philippines that exhibit a 
substantial concentration of Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs), such as Region 4A - 
CALABARZON and Region 3 - Central Luzon, and more based on the 2022 List of Establishments (LE) of the

Food Safety held the highest priority with a weight of 38%, followed by Quality (23.4%) and Reliability (15.6%). Other criteria, such as Reputation, Pricing, Variety, and Flexibility, were considered less significant in the overall ranking. 5.2 Discussion Why Food Safety is Paramount in Chiangrai The dominance of food safety as the top criterion for supplier selection in Chiangrai’s hotpot restaurants is shaped by a confluence of regulatory frameworks and cultural values, further amplified by post-pandemic consumer behavior: Regulatory Factors Thailand’s national food safety regulations, including the Food Act B.E. 2522 (1979) and subsequent amendments, establish strict hygiene standards for food handling, storage, and preparation. In Chiangrai, these regulations are rigorously enforced by the Provincial Public Health Office, which conducts unannounced inspections and mandates certifications for suppliers (Kongnim et al., 2023). Hotpot restaurants, due to their communal dining nature, face heightened scrutiny. For instance, suppliers must provide traceability documentation for raw ingredients, such as meat and seafood, to comply with post-pandemic amendments requiring transparency in supply chains (Yang et al., 2020). Non-compliance risks penalties ranging from fines to operational suspensions, compelling restaurants to prioritize suppliers with robust safety protocols. Cultural Factors Thai culinary culture places immense emphasis on “safety through freshness” (Yu et al., 2014), particularly in communal meals like hotpot, where shared ingredients symbolize trust and social cohesion. A lapse in food safety not only endangers health but also disrupts “samakki” (harmony), a core Thai cultural value. Furthermore, Buddhist principles of “metta” (compassion) and “ahimsa” (non-harm) implicitly influence consumer expectations, driving demand for ethically sourced and hygienically handled ingredients. Surveys indicate that 76% of Chiangrai diners associate food safety with a restaurant’s “moral integrity,” linking it directly to repeat patronage (Sittivangkul & Tiwong, 2022). Market Realities In Chiangrai’s tourism-dependent economy—where foodservice contributes 18% of local GDP (Statista, 2021)—a single foodborne illness incident could tarnish the city’s reputation. Post-COVID-19, 82% of tourists rank food safety as their primary concern when dining out (Chiangrai Tourism Authority, 2023). To differentiate themselves, restaurants increasingly advertise suppliers’ certifications (e.g., Thai FDA approval or Global G.A.P.), turning safety compliance into a competitive asset. This creates a self-reinforcing cycle where regulatory compliance, cultural expectations, and market competition collectively elevate food safety as the foremost supplier criterion. Analysis The prioritization of Food Safety reflects the critical importance of ensuring the safety and hygiene of ingredients in the food service industry, particularly in the post-COVID-19 era. For hotpot restaurants, where customers directly handle raw ingredients, maintaining high food safety standards is essential to prevent health risks and build customer trust. Similarly, Quality and Reliability are crucial for delivering a consistent and enjoyable dining experience, which directly impacts customer satisfaction and repeat business. 1461","thailand requires thorough examination of quality, cost, and reliability zijian feng international logistic and supply chain management, school of management mae fah luang university chiang rai, 57100, thailand eric19970620@gmail.com sunida tiwong* international logistic and supply chain management, school of management mae fah luang university chiang rai, 57100, thailand sunida.tiwong@gmail.com","References

These improvements are realized through enhanced process efficiencies, reduced waste, and increased employee ownership of improvement initiatives. For instance, Valspar's implementation of Rapid Action teams (Rapid action case study) resulted in 59 teams deploying 354 solutions, engaging 325 employees, and achieving $2.1 million in annualized savings. However, for these efforts to achieve their full potential, they must be complemented by effective tools and practices that facilitate communication and collaboration. Visual boards, when strategically implemented, serve as dynamic information hubs that enable real-time tracking of key performance indicators and foster transparency across teams. Regular huddles, in turn, provide the platform for addressing challenges, sharing updates, and aligning goals in a structured and timely manner. Together, this combination of frontline empowerment, Lean Six Sigma training, and robust visual management practices creates a synergistic framework for driving continuous improvement and sustaining operational excellence. Organizations that embrace this holistic approach stand to benefit not only in terms of measurable performance outcomes but also in cultivating a culture of innovation and accountability at every level of their operations. There are some specific areas which still need to be studied as dynamics are changing very fast, below are some recommendations for further studies: • Cross-Industry Comparisons - Comparative studies across industries, such as healthcare, manufacturing, and IT services, can help identify industry-specific challenges and best practices in frontline engagement and visual management. • Integration of Digital Technologies - Investigate how advancements in digital tools (e.g., AI-powered dashboards, augmented reality visual boards) can enhance the effectiveness of Lean Six Sigma practices. 1487",six sigma success rajiv kumar tiwari associate general manager – business excellence t.en global business services private limited rajiv.tiwari@ten.com,"References

From the study, the important conclusions are as follows: • SR is varied from 1.35µm to 2.61µm. POT was the most influential factor, whose contribution for evaluation of SR is 47.83% followed by POT and SGV with 8.30% and 4.72% respectively. • For GE the CPR shows the most important factor with 82.83% contribution. However, the SGV shows the significant (3.75%) effect on the GE. • ANOVA shows that POT is main remarkable factor for SR and GE. CPR plays the pivotal role followed by POT. • Cracks, voids, and globules of debris were found in SEM analysis.

171,Doi: 10.46254/An15.20250319  Development Of A Database System To Support Preventive,"the electronics industry in thailand heavily relies on machinery for large-scale production to enhance efficiency and reduce costs. as a result, a dedicated maintenance department is crucial to ensure proper machine upkeep, which includes maintaining a record of maintenance history. a study conducted at an electronics printer production unit, part of the plastic parts manufacturing department at an industrial plant in nakhon ratchasima, thailand, identified inefficiencies in managing maintenance data for 21 types of machinery, totaling 833 machines. the maintenance data recording process was found to be time-consuming and lacked a systematic management approach, resulting in operational inefficiencies. this paper aims to improve the process and method of data entry to enhance efficiency and reduce recording time. a fishbone diagram was used to identify the root causes of these inefficiencies. improvements were implemented based on the principles of eliminate, combine, rearrange, and simplify (ecrs). microsoft access was chosen to replace microsoft excel for maintenance data recording, as it is better suited for managing complex datasets. after implementation, the average data recording time per session decreased from 66 minutes to 30 minutes, representing a 54.55% reduction. additionally, the time to record individual machine maintenance data was reduced from 15.1 minutes to 7.2 minutes per session, a reduction of 52.32%. these results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in optimizing maintenance data management within the electronics industry.","database, microsoft access, 7wastes","The development of a database system to support preventive maintenance for machines demonstrates that an efficient database system can enhance the management of maintenance data, reduce process steps, and decrease data recording time as per the objectives. Additionally, the system provides valuable information for decision-making in machine repair processes and minimizes the risk of production disruptions in the electronics industry. The application of information technology through this database system effectively supports preventive maintenance and meets the needs of the industrial sector. However, this research was limited to a single sample factory, which may not fully represent the context of other industries. Future research could focus on developing systems adaptable to various industrial contexts or integrating advanced technologies such as AI and Machine Learning to further improve the accuracy and efficiency of maintenance processes.","maintenance of machinery in the electronics industry anusorn konpang system engineering program, school of industrial engineering, institute of engineering, suranaree university of technology, nakhon ratchasima 30000, thailand m6602680@g.sut.ac.th paphakorn pitayachaval asst.prof., school of industrial engineering, institute of engineering, suranaree university of technology, nakhon ratchasima, thailand paphakorn@g.sut.ac.th nichchapat arpwasinsuk industrial systems and environmental engineering program, school of industrial engineering, institute of engineering, suranaree university of technology, nakhon ratchasima 30000, thailand nichchapat.ar@gmail.com",
172,Doi: 10.46254/An15.20250323  Thailand’S Biomass Supply Chain: Redesigning For,"this study contributes to the design of a biomass manufacturing network in central thailand, focusing on establishing an efficient biomass supply chain. the objective is to propose an optimal supply chain framework using integration definition for function modeling (idef0) and the supply chain operations reference (scor) model. current challenges include disjointed supply chain activities, high transportation costs, inadequate centralized agricultural residue collection, lower thermal energy yield of biomass compared to fossil fuels, and significant storage space requirements. the proposed model introduces community-based biomass collection centers to minimize transport distances from agricultural sites to production facilities, while ensuring compliance with government regulations. these centers facilitate efficient residue collection and storage, with subsequent processing into biofuel and carbon credits to meet market demands driven by carbon targets and trading opportunities. additionally, the framework designs five core activities—plan, source, make, deliver, and returns—critical to biomass factory operations. solutions include a first-in-first-out (fifo) storage system, strategic biomass supply planning, location optimization via mathematical modeling, and biomass densification technologies to reduce transport costs. the torrefaction process is highlighted for efficiency gains, supporting sustainable fuel production through a streamlined, integrated supply chain tailored for thailand.","biomass fuel, idef0, scor model","This study presents a comprehensive analysis of the biomass supply chain in preparation for establishing a torrefied biomass production facility in Thailand. Using the IDEF0 and SCOR models, it addresses key challenges and opportunities related to agricultural waste utilization. In the central region, farmers often burn residues like rice straw, sugarcane leaves, and corn stalks, which harm the environment. Inconsistent biomass supply complicates production, exacerbated by high transportation costs and the seasonal nature of agricultural by-products. The long growth cycles of wood chips further affect biomass fuel’s competitiveness compared to solid fuels like coal. Empowering community enterprises offers a sustainable solution, as farmer collectives engaging in value-added activities can enhance bargaining power and improve market access, although strong leadership is crucial for their success. Establishing community biomass centers can stabilize the supply chain by collecting biomass at fair prices and implementing storage solutions to prevent decomposition. High transportation costs require strategic location planning to optimize efficiency. Additionally, increasing demand for high-quality biomass fuel, driven by CBAM regulations and AEDP 2018 commitments, emphasizes the need for fuels with calorific values comparable to coal. The key supply chain factors, including raw material availability, logistics challenges, processing requirements, and market demand for sustainable energy. The proposed solution includes a coordinated production and procurement plan based on customer demand, shared across departments to ensure efficient operations. Establishing community- run biomass centers is essential for centralizing residue collection, reducing waste, and maintaining a steady supply. A mathematical model is recommended to optimize the placement of plants and collection centers, reducing transport costs and enhancing supply chain efficiency. Seasonal and decomposition challenges will be addressed through a First In, First Out (FIFO) storage system, and supplier assessments will ensure consistent quality. The production process will use torrefaction, aligning with renewable energy goals and mitigating transport and moisture issues through drying techniques. Efficient delivery planning will maintain legal transport limits, while strategic plant locations will reduce customer costs. Quality issues will be managed collaboratively by sales and production teams, offering credits to minimize return costs and maintain customer satisfaction. This framework fosters a sustainable, efficient, and resilient biomass supply chain, supporting Thailand’s renewable energy goals and contributing to global emissions reductions. 1522","efficiency and environmental impact adisorn klamsakul graduated program in engineering management, department of industrial engineering, faculty of engineering, kasetsart university thailand adisorn.kla@ku.th pornthipa ongkunaruk* department of industrial engineering, faculty of engineering, kasetsart university thailand pornthipa.o@ku.th","References

By applying Design of Experiment (DOE), it was found that silver bath concentration, current density, plating bath temperature and plating time have a significant influence on plating thickness. Current density and coating time were identified as the most influential parameters, with a high proportion of both factors contributing to increased layer thickness. The ANOVA analysis and Pareto chart confirmed the statistical significance of these factors, while the regression model validated through confirmation runs provided a reliable prediction of coating thickness with an acceptable percentage error. These results support the practical application of focusing on current density and plating time to achieve more consistent and higher quality plating results. The results also highlight the importance of understanding the interactions between these and other factors in the electroplating process. By leveraging this knowledge, ABC Manufacturing can improve quality control, optimize production efficiency, and reduce variability, thereby improving overall operational performance.

176,Doi: 10.46254/An15.20250335  Production Process Optimization Using Pdca And,"this study addresses process optimization in a microenterprise specializing in dressmaking in peru, which faces high levels of material waste and inefficient production methods. the company had an average monthly material waste rate of 18%, exceeding the values observed in other companies in the sector, impacting costs and sustainability. the pdca (plan-do-check-act) methodology was used to identify the root causes of inefficiencies, such as the lack of standardized work methods, improper use of tools, and suboptimal cutting templates. the implemented improvements included transitioning from paper templates to rigid templates, standardizing tracing and cutting processes, and eliminating unnecessary steps in the production process. these interventions reduced production time per dress from 236 to 189 minutes (19.8%), increased annual production capacity by 24.6%, and decreased material waste from 29kg to 16kg (55.6%), resulting in a 44.6% reduction in costs associated with waste from s/7,908 to s/4,380. the findings highlight the effectiveness of lean tools and continuous improvement methods in increasing productivity and reducing waste, offering a scalable model for other microenterprises in the textile sector.","waste minimization, msme","After conducting the pilot test and comparing it to the initial recorded state, it is concluded that implementing improvements to the dress production process through method enhancement is an effective tool for increasing productivity and reducing waste. The results show a 21.25% improvement in production time per dress and a 55.56% reduction in waste per dress produced. The scalability of the implemented solutions is partially limited, particularly the improvement involving rigid templates. This is because, in larger-scale production processes, more efficient alternatives are typically chosen, replacing manual cutting with machines or cutting dies. On the other hand, the other two implemented improvements focus on optimizing the process and eliminating non-value-adding activities, making them more scalable due to the flexible nature of the method. In terms of sustainability, embedding continuous improvement within the company through an improvement project provides a powerful tool that can be used to address future challenges, further reducing waste within the company. 1559","standardized work for a dress manufacturing sme in lima, peru enrique carlos barrios garaboa and oscar omar murillo lópez bachelor of industrial engineering facultad de ingeniería, universidad de lima, perú 20180189@aloe.ulima.edu.pe, 20181278@aloe.ulima.edu.pe ezilda maría cabrera gil grados industrial engineer facultad de ingeniería, universidad de lima, perú ecabrera@ulima.edu.pe","References

178,Doi: 10.46254/An15.20250354  Self-Organised Criticality-Based Adaptive Approach To,"this research develops a theoretical framework to demonstrate how a self-organized global supply network can transition from a critical to a sub-critical state using a diversification-based risk mitigation strategy. in self-organized critical systems, the critical state represents a fragile equilibrium where small disruptions can escalate into disproportionately large avalanches due to interconnected dependencies and heightened sensitivity. in contrast, a sub- critical state signifies a more stable regime where disruptions are effectively contained, and large-scale failures are curtailed. transitioning to this state reduces the system's inherent fragility while preserving its operational dynamics. we integrated two foundational concepts from complexity science: the bak-sneppen model and the barabási-albert model and perform discrete event simulation and agent-based modelling to simulate diversification strategy that increases the number of alternate suppliers and limits production capacity to the most vulnerable nodes for events with major disruptions. the strategy is applied continuously and adaptively to address the network's natural tendency to evolve back into a critical state. the results demonstrate that this approach effectively transitions the network to a sub- critical state, reducing the vulnerability index of critical nodes and curtailing the scale of dynamic disruptions. the findings underscore the efficacy of soc-based approach in stabilizing the network and mitigating dynamic failures.","soc-based, sub-critical state","In conclusion, the proposed framework demonstrates a robust and practical approach to managing disruptions in SOC- driven supply chains. By shifting the network from a critical to a sub-critical state, it addresses both the frequency & magnitude of disruptions and the VI of critical nodes, providing actionable insights for supply chain managers. The results not only advance the theoretical understanding of SOC systems but also offer a scalable solution for mitigating risks in complex, interconnected networks. This dual contribution highlights the framework’s potential to transform risk management practices in GSN. This study bridges the gap between theoretical insights and practical applications, offering supply chain managers actionable tools for enhancing resilience. Future research could build upon this foundation by providing full visibility of network connectivity, with the goal of enhancing inter-collaboration between business enterprises, further improving resilience and efficiency. Additionally, integrating real-time data analytics and machine learning techniques could enable predictive risk management, allowing for dynamic adjustments to evolving network conditions. Exploring sector-specific applications, such as in healthcare, technology, or automotive supply chains, could validate its effectiveness further. Finally, incorporating sustainability metrics into the framework could address the growing need for environmentally conscious supply chain practices, ensuring relevance in addressing both operational and societal challenges.",mitigating dynamic disruptions in global supply chains mohamed faisal bin mohamed salleh department of industrial systems engineering and management national university of singapore e0383446@u.nus.edu eng seng chia department of industrial systems engineering and management national university of singapore iseches@nus.edu.sg,

By developing three models together, a more complete view of the system was provided, as the first two did not consider water loss during supply or the impact of water recycling on the organization. Increasing the recycling rate and implementing water efficiency technologies can significantly reduce supply shortfalls. Evaporation and leakage loss management is crucial to avoid overflows. Both organizations and taxpaying citizens must demand improvements in water supply infrastructure, as it is unacceptable that nearly half of the resource is being lost. With the results presented during the state-of-the-art research, technologies such as Membrane Bioreactors, Advanced Oxidation Processes, Reverse Osmosis and Edge Computing are mentioned, senior management should carry out a systemic study to determine which technologies are best suited to their line of business and activities, allowing them to integrate technologies for water recycling. Many of the companies have installed aerators in toilets to reduce water consumption, dry urinals, water recycling for watering green areas, and rainwater harvesting for cleaning activities. These initiatives are important steps towards a more efficient and sustainable use of water. The integration of technologies such as Membrane Bioreactors, Advanced Oxidation Processes and Reverse Osmosis allows for more effective water treatment, reducing contamination and improving water quality by ensuring that recycled water meets the necessary standards for reuse in various applications, from agricultural irrigation to human consumption. The implementation of systemic models coupled with advanced technologies has a significant positive impact on sustainable development. These models not only optimize water management but also contribute to achieving several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), especially SDG 6, which seeks to ensure the availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all. Integrated water resources management, supported by emerging technologies, strengthens resilience to climate change, better adaptation to extreme weather conditions and ensuring a stable water supply even in adverse situations. By ensuring access to clean water and adequate sanitation, water-related diseases are reduced, thereby improving the health and well-being of communities, and improving people's quality of life. Therefore, by combining analytical models with advanced technologies, we achieve not only more efficient water management, but also a move towards sustainable development that benefits both the environment and communities, allowing us to build a future where access to water can be safe and equitable for all.","a systemic organizational model victor martin maldonado benitez, gabriela guadalupe escobedo guerrero esime zacatenco, esca santo tomás, instituto politécnico nacional, mexico city, mexico vmaldonadob1500@alumno.ipn.mx, gescobedog@ipn.mx, gabrielaeg@hotmail.com lila margarita bada-carbajal senior lecturer of management, instituto tecnológico superior de álamo temapache tecnólogico nacional de méxico veracruz, mexico lila.bc@alamo.tecnm.mx brenda esmeralda moreno garduño esca santo tomás, instituto politécnico nacional, mexico city, mexico bmorenog1500@alumno.ipn.mx",

This study revealed significant gaps in South African higher education, where blockchain-related content is conspicuously absent despite its relevance in addressing challenges such as inefficiency, fraud, and lack of traceability in supply chains. While international curricula have begun to embrace blockchain concepts, South African institutions lag behind, potentially disadvantaging graduates in a globalized and digitally-driven job market. The analysis underscores the transformative potential of blockchain technology, characterized by transparency, traceability, immutability, and decentralization. These attributes align well with the skills demanded by modern logistics and supply chain operations, making their inclusion in educational programs imperative. By adopting the proposed Logistics and Supply Chain Blockchain Education (LSCBE) model, institutions can meet the expectations of key stakeholders, including students, industry partners, educational institutions, and government bodies. To address these gaps, it is recommended that South African higher education institutions: 1. Embed Blockchain Concepts in Curricula: Incorporate blockchain-focused modules that emphasize theoretical and practical applications in logistics and supply chain management. 2. Leverage Stakeholder Collaboration: Engage industry and government stakeholders to align educational content with market demands and policy objectives. 3. Adopt Innovative Pedagogical Approaches: Use case studies, simulations, and interdisciplinary projects to teach blockchain concepts effectively. The findings from this research offer a roadmap for aligning logistics and supply chain education with the demands of a digitized industry. Implementing these recommendations can enhance the employability of graduates, improve institutional competitiveness, and contribute to national goals of reducing youth unemployment and fostering economic development. As the logistics industry evolves, the integration of blockchain education is not just an opportunity but a necessity for sustainable growth.","and supply chain education: a publicly available data analysis marcus molepo lecturer, logistics and supply chain management iie rosebank college south africa mamolepo@rosebankcollege.co.za sebonkile thaba senior lecturer, transport and supply chain management university of johannesburg south africa scthaba@uj.ac.za","references to its core characteristics such as 
transparency and traceability. This lack of integration creates a critical gap in preparing graduates with the digital skills 
necessary to meet the demands of a rapidly digitizing logistics industry. As global supply chains increasingly adopt 
blockchain technologies, South African graduates’ risk being disadvantaged in both local and international markets. 
  
The LSCBE Model 
The Logistics and Supply Chain Blockchain Education (LSCBE) model, based on stakeholder theory, aims to address 
curriculum gaps by integrating blockchain's core features into LSCM education. This model Figure 2, benefits key 
stakeholders by preparing students for employment and entrepreneurship in a blockchain-driven industry, aligning 
curricula with global standards, providing graduates with blockchain competencies to drive operational efficiency and 
innovation, and addressing youth unemployment. The model emphasizes embedding blockchain concepts through 
theory and practice, case studies and simulations, and collaborative learning, focusing on industries like food 
traceability, pharmaceuticals, and ethical sourcing.

198,Doi: 10.46254/An15.20250413  From Setback To Success: Overcoming Agile Transformation,"this presentation, titled ""from setback to success: overcoming agile transformation failures with key lessons,"" discusses the frequent traps organizations fall into during their agile transformation attempts. agile holds the promise of enriched collaboration, speedier delivery, and heightened customer satisfaction, yet a dire number of organizations find themselves unable to scale or otherwise effectively implement agile practices. they encounter several common and significant challenges that i will address.the first part of the presentation will focus on some real-world examples of agile transformation ""failures."" what went wrong? what did the organization do next? what did they learn? (because these missteps often yield more useful insights than the fast, ""successful"" transformations.) the second part will offer strategies and solutions for moving forward and celebrating future successes. they promise ""enhanced collaboration, faster delivery, and improved customer satisfaction,"" yet organizations face a daunting number of significant challenges that i will address. agile delivery isn't just a ""project management"" framework, and working in a collaborative style isn't just about the tools you use. it's a cultural shift. tools help us achieve our goals, and this is certainly true in the agile space. you've probably seen this: a pie chart representing a ""typical"" organization's budget breakdown and noting that 70% of the budget goes toward projects destined to fail, according to some source that was popular in the management consultancy world a few years back. recalibrating strategy and redefining success are two things i did to help an organization overcome the hurdles that put its large-scale agile transformation on the brink of collapse. this is the story of that transformation and the lessons it teaches us. it's a story rich with lessons on how to gain buy-in from hesitant executives, build a pipeline of talented and motivated people to lead and work in that agile culture, and ensure that your success is their success too—because it has to be if you want them to keep funding your transformation. here are some of the lessons i learned from my experiences on the brink of failure with that transformation.","failure, cultural shift, strategy",The research document examined the numerous difficulties organizations encounter during Agile transformations and presented practical methods to address these obstacles. The examination of case studies together with lessons learned reveals that Agile represents a cultural transformation which demands leadership dedication alongside investments in employee development and organizational goal alignment. The essential lesson for organizations is that they need to develop an Agile mindset throughout all levels instead of merely adopting Agile tools or frameworks. The potential avenues for future research include examining Agile transformations within distinct industries to provide a detailed understanding of sustaining long-term success following initial implementation.,"failures with key lessons samant kumar portfolio manager, capgemini houston, texas samfortune501@gmail.com",

By combining behavioral observations, real-time sensor data, and machine learning models, the study was able to detect patterns in worker attentiveness and pinpoint key factors contributing to distractions on-site. The integration of AI-driven monitoring systems provided a proactive way to identify unsafe behaviors, offering real-time feedback to improve worker awareness and adherence to safety protocols. Observations, as shown in Table 1, revealed that the most common inattentive behavior was engaging in unnecessary conversations (30.0%), while failure to wear PPE was the least frequent (12.5%). Physiological data in Table 2 showed that inattentive workers had lower heart rate variability (HRV = 46 ms) and higher galvanic skin response (GSR = 5.9 µS), indicating increased stress and fatigue compared to their more attentive colleagues. Additionally, Table 3 confirmed a strong negative correlation between HRV and inattentiveness (-0.73), meaning lower HRV was linked to reduced focus. Conversely, higher GSR readings (0.69) suggested that increased stress levels contributed to inattentiveness. These findings highlight the potential of AI-based safety systems in promoting attentiveness and reducing workplace hazards. By providing real-time alerts and data-driven insights, these technologies can play a crucial role in improving construction site safety. Moving forward, refining these models and expanding their use in different work environments will further enhance their effectiveness in accident prevention and overall worker well-being.","inattentiveness in construction site workers: a preliminary study for ai-based safety systems cherry d. casuat associate professor, college of engineering/open university system/graduate school polytechnic university of the philippines manila, philippines cdcasuat@pup.edu.ph arvin de la cruz professor, open university system / graduate school polytechnic university of the philippines manila, philippines docardelacruz@gmail.com guillermo o. bernabe professor, open university system polytechnic university of the philippines manila, philippines gobernabe@pup.edu.ph joshua benjamin b. rodriguez professor, college of engineering/ open university system polytechnic university of the philippines manila, philippines jan reuelle p. teña student, graduate school polytechnic university of the philippines manila, philippines",

By comparing traditional manufacturing and 3D printing, we highlight the strategic trade-offs businesses face when considering this disruptive technology. While 3D printing offers significant benefits, such as reduced inventory costs, enhanced flexibility, and improved responsiveness to demand variability, its adoption introduces challenges like higher variable costs and capacity limitations. Our findings reveal that 3D printing can be a viable alternative to traditional manufacturing under specific conditions, particularly when demand patterns favor customization and agility. Moreover, the results emphasize the importance of aligning supply chain coordination mechanisms to fully capitalize on the benefits of 3D printing while minimizing inefficiencies such as double marginalization. The derived equilibrium solutions underscore the dynamic interplay between cost structures, pricing strategies, and capacity constraints in determining the optimal manufacturing approach. Through numerical analysis, we further illustrate how critical parameters such as production costs, demand variability, and capacity influence the equilibrium strategies for manufacturers and retailers. These insights provide actionable guidance for businesses evaluating the adoption of 3D printing as part of their supply chain strategy, enabling them to balance cost efficiency with market responsiveness effectively. In conclusion, 3D printing represents a paradigm shift in manufacturing and supply chain management, offering both opportunities and challenges. By rigorously analyzing these dynamics, this research contributes to the growing body of literature on additive manufacturing and its role in transforming modern supply chains. Future research could expand on these findings by exploring multi-product scenarios or integrating environmental sustainability into the decision-making framework, further enriching the understanding of 3D printing's potential in complex supply chain ecosystems. 1842","chains: a stackelberg framework for optimal manufacturing decisions mohammad e. arbabian assistant professor, pamplin school of business professor of operations and technology management university of portland portland, or, usa arbabian@up.edu","References.

The analysis revealed that the increase in total port stay time for container vessels is predominately driven by extended operation times, while the impact of anchorage times appears to be relatively minor. This observation indicated that congestion is primarily linked to the concentration of cargo operations at specific port terminals, leading to bottlenecks that causes a negative impact on handling efficiency. Moreover, the slight increase in anchorage time suggests that major container ports are prioritising berthing for large container vessels operating on key east-west trade routes, thereby facilitating efficient berthing for these vessels despite the presence of other operational inefficiencies. Future research will concentrate specifically on vessel stay times at the Port of Singapore to unveil unique operational challenges and trends within this context. A key objective will be to compare Singapore vessel stay time patterns with the general trends identified in this study, particularly on the dominance of operation time over anchorage time. Furthermore, the study will seek to identify causes of port congestions in Singapore, including infrastructure constraints, scheduling inefficiencies, and other external disruption such as geopolitical tensions. By addressing these findings, targeted strategies will be developed to alleviate congestion. These initiatives will not only assist Singapore in tackling its port congestion issues but also offer valuable insights for other major ports striving to enhance their global competitiveness and ensuring supply chain reliability. 1884","focus on key causes and strategic solutions chew zhi yao charmaine undergraduate, logistics and supply chain management program school of business singapore university of social sciences (suss) singapore charmainechew001@suss.edu.sg zengqi xiao lecturer, logistics and supply chain management program school of business singapore university of social sciences (suss) singapore zengqixiao@suss.edu.sg tan yan weng associate professor and head, logistics and supply chain management programme school of business, singapore university of social sciences singapore ywtan@suss.edu.sg","References

Using a combination of deterministic modeling and macro genetics principles, we developed a framework to predict the inheritance patterns of the overall key traits. We obtained a mathematical model capable of computing the Boer degree of a filial in a back-crossing. The model can predict the properties of the Boer degree of any filial in a consecutive back-crossing. For instance, the analytical formula and simulations suggest that strategic selection of back-crossing parental lines is needed to accelerate the introgression of target traits, compared to conventional inter- filial breeding methods. In addition, it can also determine the filial generation for a required Boer degree and a certain level of Boer degree improvement of the filial. The back-crossing can be terminated to a certain generation of filial with sufficiently high predetermined Boer degree, e.g., up to F5, since further filial will not give a significant improvement. Moreover, the inclusion of economic factors ensures the feasibility of these improvements for commercial application. The results above are obtained by combining analytical and numerical methods. Overall, the paper demonstrated that a mathematical model can significantly enhance the understanding of back-crossing programs. Finally, this study highlights the potential of mathematical tools to revolutionize goat breeding practices, offering a scientific basis for decision-making in agricultural systems. The findings provide actionable insights for breeders and policymakers, paving the way for sustainable and efficient meat production.","production through back-crossing breeding strategy principia d. haniefah and diana s. mardijanti sma negeri 3 bandung, jl. belitung no 8 bandung, west-java, indonesia principia2021af@gmail.com and dianasusyari322@gmail.com",

210,Doi: 10.46254/An15.20250451  Transforming Drug Sustainable Supply Chain Framework,"as the drug supply chain becomes more complex and the demand for efficiency and sustainability increases, there is a growing need for innovative approaches in supply chain management. these challenges were required to be dealt with efficiently, and artificial intelligence (ai) is definitely a booming technology to meet these challenges through capabilities such as real-time tracking of new drivers, risk management, and notional operational optimization. using systematic literature review (slr) method this research synthesizes the content of multiple articles published from 2003 to 2025,with a total of 542 articles and 329 articles. it has a particular focus on ai in sustainable supply chain, discussing factors like predictive analytics, automation, and optimization. analysis was conducted via a bibliometrics tool (biblioshiny) to uncover the data pertinent literature and trends, assuring all necessary data were included. results revealed that ai led to a 25% decrease in inventory errors and a growth in forecast accuracy of 40%, resulting in reduced carbon footprints through improved logistics. moreover, ai-based models showed their ability to overcome fragmented data integration and minimize the risk of drug shortages. these results are highly advantageous for the pharmaceuticals, offering cost savings, faster drug development times, and a stronger focus on sustainability. also, this study lay a foundation toward knowledge creation on ai use in supply chains and a theoretical stimulating base for future investigations to develop sustainable, integrated, and resilient supply chain systems.",drugs supply chain,"The results obtained with the AI-based SSCM model can be directly translated into the benefits to customers in terms of: drug availability, reduced delivery time, having transparent tracking information, and guaranteed product safety. This also aligns with the needs of customers who are more sustainability-conscious and thrice-above of the impact on environmental sustainability that directly comes from this. Validation that leveraging AI in the pharmaceutical supply chain creates operational efficiencies and ultimately has positive influences on sustainability and customer experience. 6. Conclusion This study is the first to demonstrate how AI can facilitate pharmaceutical supply chain sustainability. This research uses a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) method to navigate the literature and aggregate findings to further extend knowledge on the ways of exploiting various types of AI solutions in solving complex operational issues, for example in real-time product tracing, risk management, or efficient distribution optimization. The findings validate that AI serves not only as an enabling technology but also as a transformation driver in developing an adaptive and sustainable pharmaceutical supply chain. However, there are some limitations that undermine the generalizability of these findings. First, much of the literature included in the analysis is limited by its applicability to a specific case study, and oftentimes does not take a more holistic approach to the entire pharmaceutical supply chain ecosystem. Secondly, this work reported no simulation or empirical validation, which could provide such quantitative evidence of success of AI-based models in real implementation environments. Third, with entities across the supply chain having disparate systems that report different metrics, integrating data is a significant challenge that calls for more holistic technological and policy response. The pharmaceutical industry is greatly impacted. This study illustrates how AI can reduce dependency on manual processes, enhance accuracy in predicting drug requirements, and noticeably lower operation expenses. Furthermore, AI-based solutions that optimize resource management will not only serve their businesses in operating efficiently, but also reinforce the industry’s commitment to sustainable approaches. This includes reducing carbon footprint as a result of better logistics and waste management. On the academic front, this study provides a new theoretical construct combining AI technology in the context of supply chains around sustainable business practices. This framework leads to other research where more accurate prediction models, deep learning algorithms, and more broad-risk mitigation strategies can be developed. Hence, this study not only expands on the existing academic literature, it can guide broader areas of practical implementation within the pharma sector and beyond that accounts sustainability.","with artificial intelligence fajri adhi guna, angga jovansyah, surjandy, and leonard goermanto informatics department institut teknologi sains bandung (itsb) cikarang, indonesia fajri.guna@itsb.ac.id, anggajovansyahm@gmail.com, surjandy@itsb.ac.id, leonard@itsb.ac.id",

213,Doi: 10.46254/An15.20250456  Impact Of The Proactive Environmental Strategy And,"as global environmental issues intensify, enterprises face increasing pressure to pursue sustainable development. china’s manufacturing industry plays a critical role by significantly contributing to gdp, job creation, and export volumes globally. however, its rapid expansion, fueled by intensive resource consumption, has caused environmental degradation and increasing emissions. consequently, china risks lagging behind other industrialized nations unless strides are made toward sustainable development. this study, grounded in the context of china’s manufacturing industry, develops a conceptual framework to examine the influence of proactive environmental strategy (pes) and environmental collaboration (ec) on sustainability performance. pes refers to proactive environmental initiatives undertaken by enterprises to surpass basic regulatory requirements, aiming to enhance resource efficiency and minimize environmental impacts. ec focuses on collaborative efforts between enterprises and their upstream and downstream supply chain partners to jointly advance environmental management practices. the proposed framework highlights the mediating role of environmental collaboration in proactive environmental strategies to enhance corporate sustainable performance. it specifically addresses how to achieve three dimensions of sustainability performance, including environmental, economic and social aspects. this study will use quantitative methods with data collection through surveys distributed to manufacturing companies in shaanxi province of china. structural equation modeling will be employed to find out the relationship between variables. the contribution of this study lies in offering theoretical foundations and practical guidance for china’s manufacturing sector in adopting sustainable strategies. by identifying critical driving factors and mediating variables, it provides enterprises with pathways to achieve green transformation in complex environments. furthermore, this framework offers a solid basis for future research and provides policymakers with actionable insights to bridge micro-level practices with macro-level sustainability goals. 1978",,,"environmental collaboration on sustainability performance in chinese manufacturing industry: a conceptual framework wang xiao, thoo ai chin and lee van faculty of management universiti teknologi malaysia johor bahru, malaysia school of trade and circulation shaanxi polytechnic institute xianyang, china wangxiao@graduate.utm.my, acthoo@utm.my, leevan@graduate.utm.my huam hon tat faculty of business city university of macau macau, china hontathuam@cityu.edu.mo",

The first goal focused on assessing flowability by analysing density, printing speed, and clay mixtures, along with the buildability of continuous extrusion of ceramic clay. The second goal involved examining the impact of process parameters on layering quality and faults in printed products by evaluating nozzle diameter and layer height. Finally, the third goal was achieved by printing simple forms to test specific geometric characteristics. The study used Sayong clay, a locally available material in Malaysia, due to its accessibility and cost-effectiveness. Mixture A, with the least water content, yielded the best results, as higher water concentrations reduced clay density. The optimal printing speed was determined to be 30 mm/s for steady extrusion and intact samples. Nozzle diameter tests revealed smaller diameters reduced wall expansion, and a ratio of 1:3 for layer height to nozzle diameter provided smooth, defect-free prints. The findings demonstrate that the material and physical properties examined using the Tronxy Moore 1 clay 3D printer are suitable for clay-based additive manufacturing. Sayong clay shows significant potential for industrial use. Future research should investigate Sayong clay’s vitrification, porosity, and hardness at varying temperatures, develop new clay formulas for broader regional applications, and establish advanced sintering and glazing parameters.

This study proposed a comprehensive framework for determining the optimal level of automation, supported by a FUCOM- based decision-making model and demonstrated through a case study. By classifying automation into digitalized, robot-assisted, and fully automated categories, the framework provides a clear path for businesses to align their operational needs with appropriate automation solutions. While this research lays the groundwork for automating OPS, future efforts should focus on optimizing key design areas – routing, layout, batching, zoning, and storage strategies – through advanced simulation tools, such as Visual Components, Simio, or Flexsim. Furthermore, the authors recommend investigating the concept of “lean automation” to ensure that efficiency gains from automation are not offset by waste introduced during implementation.","picking systems: a fucom-based case study ruba aljedani, khadijah bashatah, areeb abubaker senior industrial engineering students, department of industrial engineering faculty of engineering, king abdulaziz university jeddah 21589, saudi arabia waleed mirdad assistant professor, department of industrial engineering faculty of engineering, king abdulaziz university jeddah 21589, saudi arabia wmirdad@kau.edu.sa",

Using the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), the findings provide a clear picture of which academic and non-academic services excel in meeting student expectations and which areas require improvement. Based on the results, a management system framework was developed to guide continuous evaluation and enhancement of student services at the University. The framework emphasizes data-driven decision-making, targeted improvements, and fostering a culture of excellence in service delivery. Recognizing top-performing academic and non-academic student offices can further motivate all schools of the University as well as its non-academic student services to strive for higher standards, ensuring that the University consistently meets the evolving needs of its students. Furthermore, the insights gained from this study can be used as basis for policy-making efforts to institutionalize best practices and ensure consistent, high-quality service across the University. Future research could explore longitudinal assessments of student services, tracking changes in satisfaction over multiple semesters or academic years. Additionally, incorporating qualitative feedback like focus groups and in-depth interviews may provide deeper insights into the specific needs and preferences of diverse student populations, further refining the improvement strategies and policy-making initiatives that may be formulated because of the study. 2096","and improving student services mary joan r. ocampo and nanette t. salazar department of industrial engineering school of engineering, university of san jose-recoletos, philippines joan.ocampo@usjr.edu.ph , nanette.salazar@usjr.edu.ph ricky b. villeta associate professor, department of mathematics, school of computing, artificial intelligence and sciences, cebu normal university, philippines rbvilleta35@usjr.edu.ph","References

225,Doi: 10.46254/An15.20250485  Dynamic Simulation Of The Impact Of Silica Gel And Water,"research on working pairs is essential for understanding the performance of adsorption refrigeration systems. this study aims to investigate the characteristics of two types of silica gels, rd and a, with respect to their capacity and rate of adsorption and desorption of water vapor. a modeling approach that integrates experimental results was used to simulate an adsorption refrigeration system, considering the properties of silica gels and boundary conditions. the simulations featured operating pressures of 2.5 kpa and a cooling temperature of 30°c for the adsorption process and operating pressures of 6.2 kpa with a heating temperature of 85°c for the desorption process. a computational fluid dynamics (cfd) simulation method utilizing toth isotherm modeling was employed to determine the isothermal characteristics, while linear driving force (ldf) modeling was used to assess the kinetic characteristics. the simulation results indicate that silica gel type rd has higher adsorption and desorption capacities than silica gel type a when interacting with water. after 100 seconds in the transient phase, type rd reached an adsorption capacity of 0.1741 kg/kg, while type a achieved only 0.1256 kg/kg. by the end of the process, type rd's adsorption capacity increased to 0.2127 kg/kg, whereas type a's capacity reached 0.1422 kg/kg. during the desorption process, type rd also exhibited higher desorption capacities at every stage. after 100 seconds, type rd recorded a desorption capacity of 0.0517 kg/kg, while type a reached only 0.0370 kg/kg. at saturation, the desorption value for type rd was 0.0474 kg/kg, in contrast to type a's value of 0.0334 kg/kg.","adsorption, silica gel, uptake, cfd simulation","The researchers emphasized the key characteristics of silica gel types A and RD as adsorbents during isothermal and kinetic adsorption and desorption operations conducted at cooling temperatures of 303.15 K and heating temperatures of 358 K. They found that the adsorption and desorption capacities of silica gel type RD with water are greater than those of silica gel type A. After 100 seconds, the adsorption capacity of type RD is 0.1741 kg/kg, while type A achieves only 0.1256 kg/kg. By the end of the process, the adsorption capacity of type RD increases to 0.2127 kg/kg, whereas type A only reaches 0.1422 kg/kg. Throughout the desorption process, type RD consistently exhibits a higher desorption capacity. At the end of the transient phase, after 100 seconds, the desorption capacity of type RD is 0.0517 kg/kg, compared to type A, which achieves only 0.0370 kg/kg. By the end of the saturation phase, type RD shows a desorption value of 0.0474 kg/kg, while type A has only 0.0334 kg/kg. Additionally, the optimal cycle time for using silica gel types A and RD with water is limited to just 2000 seconds. In terms of temperature distribution, silica gel type A is more effective in cooling compared to type RD, although the difference is minimal. Variations in the working pairs between silica gel types A and RD do not significantly impact temperature and pressure changes. Additionally, the isothermal characteristics of the silica gel used greatly influence adsorption performance, as indicated by adsorption and desorption capabilities. When considering the properties of the adsorbent material, higher porous volume values are associated with improved adsorption capabilities. However, the results of this study cannot be fully generalized to different working conditions without specific adjustments. The characteristics of adsorption and desorption are significantly influenced by factors such as temperature, pressure, working pairs, and cycle time. Therefore, to apply these findings to other scenarios, further simulations or experimental validations are needed to ensure accuracy under different working conditions.","working pairs on the performance characteristics of adsorption refrigeration systems ibnu naufal, denny prasetyo, isra mahendraand agus prihatno department of mechanical engineering, faculty of engineering sebelas maret university indonesia ibnunaufal@student.uns.ac.id, isramahendra007@student.uns.ac.id, dennyprasetyo@student.uns.ac.id, agusprihatno200802@student.uns.ac.id indri yaningsih and dominicus danardono dwi prija tjahjana associate professor, department of mechanical engineering, faculty of engineering sebelas maret university indonesia indriyaningsih@staff.uns.ac.id, ddanardono@staff.ac.id",

While findings from PESTLE, AHP, and Hofstede’s analysis favor China, customer surveys and operational insights strongly favor Malaysia. This decision aligns with Company X’s cost savings goals, improved product quality, and stronger relationships with customers and employees, ensuring long-term growth and competitiveness in the AFC industry. Recent market developments further validate this choice. Rising geopolitical tensions, such as U.S.-China trade issues, have prompted major companies like IBM (Liu 2024) and HP (Investing.com 2024) to reduce their reliance on China. Malaysia is emerging as a preferred alternative due to its political stability, tech-friendly policies, and economic growth (Banerjee 2024). Significant investments, such as Infineon’s SGD10 billion chip factory, highlight Malaysia’s growing appeal (ST Business 2024). Conversely, China faces economic challenges, including declining foreign investments, signaling increased risks (The Feed 2024). These trends strengthen the case for Malaysia as the strategic location for Hardware V production. Table 6. Summary of results 5.2 Recommendations This study focused on factory gate costs for Hardware V. However, future research should incorporate end-to-end costs, including transportation, installation, and after-sales services, for a more comprehensive expense analysis. Additionally, conducting separate quality Pareto analyses for each manufacturing location would help identify and address location-specific issues more effectively. While customer surveys indicated a preference for Malaysia-made products, more profound studies on customer satisfaction and product performance post-deployment could provide actionable insights. With a growing emphasis on sustainability, future studies should evaluate the environmental impact of manufacturing in Malaysia and China, focusing on energy use, waste, and emissions. Expanding risk assessment through a detailed matrix considering supply chain and political risks could enhance disaster preparedness. Lastly, exploring emerging manufacturing hubs like Vietnam, India, and Thailand could uncover new alternatives to China and Malaysia, aligning with broader market trends and strategic opportunities. Acknowledgements We extend our sincere gratitude to the management of Company X, notably the CEO and Vice President of Operations, for their invaluable support and guidance throughout this project. We appreciate the contributions of the Supply Chain, Finance, and Engineering teams, whose expertise and insights were pivotal to the project's success.

229,Doi: 10.46254/An15.20250497  Ai-Driven Data Governance For Smart Cities: Balancing,"the integration of artificial intelligence (ai) in smart cities has transformed urban governance, enhancing efficiency in public services, infrastructure management, and decision-making. however, the widespread use of ai for data collection and analysis raises significant challenges related to privacy, algorithmic bias, transparency, and public trust. without proper governance, ai systems risk exacerbating inequalities, infringing on citizen rights, and reducing accountability in automated decision-making. this paper explores how ai-driven frameworks can enhance data governance while ensuring privacy protection, algorithmic fairness, and citizen empowerment. key strategies include federated learning to enable decentralized data processing, differential privacy to protect individual identities, and explainable ai (xai) to increase transparency in automated decisions. additionally, bias detection mechanisms and algorithmic audits are essential to prevent discrimination in ai-driven urban systems. public trust is crucial in smart city initiatives, requiring citizen engagement models, participatory ai councils, and transparent data-sharing policies. case studies from barcelona, singapore, buenos aires and toronto illustrate effective ai governance approaches that balance innovation with ethical considerations. the paper proposes a comprehensive governance framework integrating privacy-centric ai, fairness-aware algorithms, and public engagement strategies to ensure sustainable, transparent, and accountable ai-driven urban ecosystems. by aligning technological advancements with ethical and legal safeguards, smart cities can optimize ai’s potential while maintaining public trust and regulatory compliance.","ai governance, smart cities, data privacy, ethical ai, public trust. 2162",,"privacy, efficiency, and public trust sergio mastrogiovanni new york university, new york, ny, usa iae business school, buenos aires, argentina sm7758@nyu.edu, smastrogiovanni@alumni.iae.edu.ar",
230,Doi: 10.46254/An15.20250502  Implementation Of Work Standardization To Improve The,"in the peruvian context, the operating costs associated with the transportation of hydrocarbons represent a significant challenge for smes in the transportation sector, especially due to high fuel consumption. according to the ministry of energy and mines (minem,2023), land transportation activity increased by 6.7% in the last year, which highlights the need to implement strategies that optimize distribution efficiency. this research proposes an improvement model based on three key tools: total productive maintenance (tpm), telemetry for efficient fleet management and work standardization, with the objective of reducing fuel consumption and travel time in logistics routes. the methodology applied is descriptive and quantitative, framed in a continuous improvement model. the results obtained validate the effectiveness of the model through simulations and field tests, achieving a 7.7% reduction in fuel consumption per vehicle and a 17.9% reduction in total route time on the lima - arequipa route and vice versa. these findings highlight the model's potential to increase the competitiveness and operational sustainability of companies in the sector.","tpm, standardization, telemetry","With the results obtained, it is concluded that the implementation of the proposed model in the company allowed a significant reduction in fuel consumption and transit times. The standardization of activities during transportation allowed saving 19.74 gallons per trip, which is equivalent to a 9.66% savings in fuel. This value was analyzed according to the volume of trips made per month (4 trips), which demonstrates the efficiency of the model applied. In addition, by optimizing route planning, transit time was reduced to 127.20 hours per trip. It was also observed that the optimal idling fuel consumption corresponds to 3.14 gallons per trip on the selected route, which contributes to greater operational efficiency. The economic analysis of the project highlights its high viability, with a positive Net Present Value (NPV) of 416,018 soles and an average Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of 135.5%. These indicators demonstrate that the project is profitable and generates a high rate of return on investment. The sensitivity analysis identified the number of trucks as one of the most sensitive variables for the economic viability of the project. To ensure a positive NPV and project profitability, a minimum fleet of 15 vehicles is required. This highlights the importance of proper planning and the need to have an adequate fleet to maximize profits. In summary, the implementation of the improvements has proven to be effective both in terms of operational efficiency and economic profitability, which positions the company in a favorable scenario for its growth and competitiveness in the market.","fuel efficiency ratio in an smb in the hydrocarbon transportation sector angel fernando dávila-zorrilla, faculty of engineering, university of lima, peru 20190575@aloe.ulima.edu.pe gustavo campos-panduro faculty of engineering, university of lima, peru 20192531@aloe.ulima.edu.pe elsie bonilla pastor de céspedes research professor faculty of engineering, university of lima, peru ebonilla@ulima.edu.pe",
231,Doi: 10.46254/An15.20250506  From Posts To Perception: Exploring The Impact Of,"the global adoption of electric vehicles (evs) is critical for achieving sustainability and reducing carbon emissions. this study investigates how emotional expressions and post types in organization-generated content (ogc) influence public sentiment toward evs, using data collected from facebook. by employing sentiment analysis and linear regression models, the research evaluates the effects of positive and negative emotions, post types (photos, videos, others), reading complexity and control variables such as administrative country type. the results reveal that positive emotions like joy and trust significantly enhance public sentiment, while negative emotions, particularly fear, reduce it. posts featuring photos outperform videos and other formats in driving favorable sentiment. reading complexity negatively impacts sentiment, emphasizing the need for clear and accessible language. additionally, posts from non- developed countries exhibit lower sentiment scores compared to those from developed countries. these findings highlight the importance of crafting emotionally resonant and visually engaging content to promote ev adoption. the study offers actionable insights for organizations to optimize their communication strategies, fostering positive public perceptions and supporting the global transition to sustainable transportation. future research could explore platform- specific effects and integrate user-generated content for a broader understanding of ev-related sentiment.","sustainability, sentiment analysis","This study explored how emotional expressions, post types, reading complexity and control variables influence public sentiment toward OGC about EVs. The findings revealed that emotional tone and multimedia content are critical drivers of sentiment. Positive emotions, such as joy and trust, significantly enhance public perception, while negative emotions, especially fear, harm it. Posts with photos and videos are more effective in generating positive sentiment compared to text-only posts. Reading complexity also emerged as a key factor, with simpler language yielding better sentiment scores. Finally, the administrative country type influenced sentiment, with posts from developed countries eliciting more favorable responses. The results have important implications for organizations aiming to promote EV adoption through social media. First, emphasizing positive emotional expressions and reducing negative tones in OGC can improve audience perception. Second, leveraging visual content, particularly photos, can enhance the effectiveness of communication. Third, using simple and clear language is essential to ensure accessibility and comprehension. Lastly, tailoring communication strategies to regional and cultural contexts is critical for addressing disparities in sentiment across different countries. Future research could build on these findings by examining other moderating factors, such as platform-specific effects or audience demographics. Additionally, integrating user-generated content (UGC) into the analysis could provide a more holistic view of public sentiment toward EVs. These efforts will help organizations craft more effective communication strategies, ultimately fostering greater adoption of EVs and supporting global sustainability goals.","organizational content on public sentiment toward evs gaurav sharma vinod gupta school of management indian institute of technology kharagpur, west bengal, india grvsrma55@gmail.com swagato chatterjee school of business and management queen mary university of london, london, uk swagato1987@gmail.com m vimala rani vinod gupta school of management indian institute of technology kharagpur, west bengal, india vimala@vgsom.iitkgp.ac.in","references of new and used car buyers in the united states.

233,Doi: 10.46254/An15.20250515  Factors Influencing The Delays In Execution And,"this study examined the variables that contributed to project delays, including endogenous and exogenous factors, specifically the road infrastructure projects supervised by the department of public works and highways isabela 4th district engineering office. it aimed to provide valuable insights for the creation of mitigation plans intended to reduce delays in road construction projects. the paper utilized a qualitative research methodology, collecting data from project managers, engineers, and inspectors through quantitative questionnaires. it employed rank correlation and severity indexes to analyze the data and identified 46 potential causes of delay for endogenous factors and 7 potential causes of delay for exogenous factors. the top 3 endogenous factors were (1) insufficient laborers, (2) shortage of equipment, and (3) low labor productivity, and the top 2 exogenous factors were (1) weather conditions and (2) political situation. the survey revealed a moderate level of agreement (51.07%) between the implementing office and contractors regarding endogenous factors. there were no correlation (57.14%) amongst the exogenous factors. the recommendations included developing comprehensive plans and schedules for both wet and dry seasons, ensuring adequate personnel, improving equipment management, enhancing worker productivity, conducting thorough surveys, and complying with all legal and regulatory requirements in restricted areas.",severity index,"a) Ranking of Endogenous Factor-Related Delays The ranking of endogenous factors associated with construction delays indicates that the availability of resources, including staff and equipment, effective management and coordination, and timely decision-making by the owner are the most critical areas to address to mitigate delays. The key priorities should be making sure there are enough resources, enhancing the planning and coordination procedures, and preserving excellent communication amongst all stakeholders, as technical and design challenges are also significant. By addressing these main criteria, construction projects may be completed more quickly and with more success. b) Ranking of Exogenous Factor-Related Delays External factors highlight a variety of reasons for delays, the most notable of which are weather and political circumstances. Knowing these rankings aids in the prioritization of risk management techniques, with an emphasis on minimizing delays by mitigating the risks that are listed highest. c) Ranking of Severity of the Endogenous Factor-Related Delays Based on Implementing Office The most crucial delays were determined to be those caused by endogenous factors, which included insufficient equipment and vehicles for the work, low labor productivity, and a shortage of equipment. The impact level of these delays was considerable. The DPWH Isabela 4th District Engineering Office is responsible for managing and supervising several road development projects. Contractors frequently operate on several projects at once, so they might allocate equipment and cars to the most important one. In addition, most construction workers are from rural areas, such as hills and sitios. These individuals relocate to the city in search of employment, frequently taking on roles that are beneath their skill level. On occasion, road development projects in remote locations require construction companies to hire local laborers as temporary workers; many of these workers lack formal training or construction work experience. Moreover, most contracting businesses in the DPWH Isabela 4th District Engineering Office are tiny and fall between the Small A and Medium A license categories. Because of this, many of these businesses must rent construction equipment when needed because they lack the necessary equipment. There is a high demand for the equipment during periods of building, which leads to a shortage and inadequate upkeep. The project is delayed because of the equipment failure brought about by this shortage of equipment. Although these issues are mostly under control, they serve as reminders of how important it is to manage equipment, train staff, and allocate resources sensibly. d) Ranking of Severity of the Exogenous Factor-Related Delays Based on Implementing Office Under exogenous factors, weather conditions proved to be the primary source of delay. These may put workers' safety in jeopardy and force a halt to construction operations. For instance, prolonged, intense rains can result in damage as well as other issues like equipment failure, road closures, and structural collapses. These are not under the implementing office's control, but they have a major effect on project durations. e) Ranking of Severity of the Endogenous Factor-Related Delays Based on Contractors Endogenous factors showed that, according to contractors, the two main reasons for delays are unreasonable project timelines and insufficient laborers. The DPWH Isabela 4th District Engineering Office's planning engineers scheduled and determined the project's duration based on the project's scope of work and their estimated hourly output in accordance with the DPWH Standards and Specifications; some of these may be too short and could be the cause of an unrealistic work program issue. In addition, skilled labor is currently in short supply in the construction industry. Despite the rising demand for their services, several firms are experiencing a labor shortage, and some contractors are not recruiting enough people. f) Ranking of Severity of the Exogenous Factor-Related Delays Based on Contractors Weather conditions were determined to be the most serious cause of exogenous factor-related delays based on contractors. While this isn't always the case, contractors' subpar project management practices usually contribute to these delays. Contractors need to prioritize and expedite their work because Isabela Province may have unexpected weather for a lengthy period. All year long, there is a considerable amount of rainfall in the eastern 2211","implementation of road infrastructure projects supervised by dpwh isabela 4th district engineering office jean kyle l. tuason office of the district engineer – procurement unit department of public works and highways, isabela fourth district engineering office, quezon, san isidro, isabela, 3310, philippines and graduate school, polytechnic university of the philippines, manila 1016, philippines joselinda m. golpeo graduate school polytechnic university of the philippines, manila 1016, philippines","References

Our approach begins by providing a quantitative description of each hazard’s occurrence frequency and severity, recognizing that one hazard can elevate another’s likelihood (and impact) when they occur concurrently. We derive the joint distribution for hazard occurrence times and severities for all hazards relevant to the system. Building on this characterization, we then model how the system’s performance degrades and recovers in the presence of these hazards, leading to a time-varying, multimodal depiction of system availability. We further define several resilience measures—namely, instantaneous, overall, and average resilience—that rely on availability to capture system performance, robustness, and recovery capabilities. The accuracy and practical utility of these proposed availability and resilience formulations are corroborated by both simulation and numerical case studies.","dependent hazards yian wei phd student, department of data and systems engineering the university of hong kong pokfulam, hong kong yianwei@connect.hku.hk anchi li phd student, department of data and systems engineering the university of hong kong pokfulam, hong kong lianchi@connect.hku.hk",

First, we quantitatively characterize hazards’ occurrence frequency and severity, considering that their occurrence frequency (and severity) can be increased (and amplified) by their dependent hazards. We obtain the joint distribution of the occurrence time and severity of all hazards that pose threats to the system. Based on the hazards characterization, we investigate system performance degradation and recovery processes under the hazards and accordingly, obtain system multimodal availability across time. We then employ availability as system overall performance and model the instantaneous resilience of the system. The accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method are verified by a simulation study and a numerical case.","anchi li phd student, department of data and systems engineering the university of hong kong pokfulam, hong kong lianchi@connect.hku.hk yian wei phd student, department of data and systems engineering the university of hong kong pokfulam, hong kong yianwei@connect.hku.hk",

The inherent heterogeneity of these units—reflected in variations in age, inspection history, and maintenance conditions—arises from continuous production and the repeated execution of SIM actions, thereby complicating the design of effective maintenance strategies. The proposed SIM plans are formulated to optimally allocate limited inspection and maintenance resources (for example, by minimizing the total number of inspections at an acceptable cost) while ensuring that the reliability metrics of the one-shot units are maintained at a desired level. Our numerical analysis investigates performance of the optimal SIM plans and its superiority over other alternatives.","plans for one-shot units yian wei phd student, department of data and systems engineering the university of hong kong pokfulam, hong kong yianwei@connect.hku.hk anchi li phd student, department of data and systems engineering the university of hong kong pokfulam, hong kong lianchi@connect.hku.hk",

Additionally, the system includes a protective component that can prevent failure propagation when it is functioning properly. We propose a hybrid IM policy that involves two inspection schemes: a major inspection triggered when the system performance drops below a specific threshold, and a minor inspection scheduled for the protective component after a certain period following its last inspection. The system's long-term profit rate under the proposed IM policies is modeled by the MRGP framework.

In today’s world, many industries including oil and gas construction projects rely on sound QC systems for safety, productivity, and profitability. QC system is a key to long-term success, cost cutting, safety enhancement, and gaining the confidence of the clients and stakeholders. Measures such as defined quality standards, regular inspections, and tests are critical in identifying defects at the early stages, avoiding mishaps, and guaranteeing the highest quality of products. Non-destructive testing techniques like Penetrant Testing (PT), Ultrasonic Testing (UT), and Radiographic Testing (RT) enable companies to test the integrity of the materials without compromising on the material. However, the training and certification of quality control staff are also crucial to guarantee that all processes are performed efficiently and by the current best practices. Those organizations that have emphasized having a good quality control system not only reduce the probability of failures and expensive rectifications but also gain a competitive edge over other organizations by offering quality and reliable products. Also, the survey findings provide important information on the present situation of mechanical quality control in different industries.
