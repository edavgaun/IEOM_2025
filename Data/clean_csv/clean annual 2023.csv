0,An Empirical Investigation Of Factors Affecting  Humanitarian Logistics Operations:,"this paper aims to investigate the factors affecting the operations and efficiency of humanitarian logistics (hl) through its three main phases of preparedness, response, and recovery in the developing country context of palestine. a quantitative research methodology using a survey instrument was employed in this study through which data were collected from 108 hl offices in government, ngos, and other private logistics institutions operating in palestine. data were analyzed for its empirical significance on spss v21.0 using pearson correlation coefficient test. the results show that the most influential factor on efficiency of preparedness phase was “planning for logistics operations”, whereas the most influential factors on response and recovery phases were “logistics technical operations” and “logistics, governmental, organizational and infrastructure issues”, respectively. furthermore, there is a positive correlation between factors of preparedness phase and efficiency of both response and recovery phases, and between factors of response phase and efficiency of recovery phase. this study provides valuable insights for hl organizations, ngos, and policymakers on factors required to enhance efficiency and overall performance of hl management in palestine and other developing country context with similar political and economic challenges.",,"In this study, an investigation of the factors affecting performance and efficiency of HL in the developing country context of Palestine was conducted. Three main phases of HL were included in this empirical investigation, namely: preparedness, response, and recovery phases. The results confirmed that “planning for logistics operations” was the most significant factors affecting efficiency of preparedness phase. Also, “logistics technical operations issues” was the most significant factor contributing to response phase efficiency. Whereas “infrastructure of logistics, governments and other organizations” had the greatest impact on efficiency of recovery phase of HL. This study is considered the first study to investigate factors affecting HL along the lifecycle of the logistics process, starting from preparedness, through response, and ending up with the recovery stage. The current study provides HL managers and policymakers with evidence on the need to invest more in planning for logistics operations as cornerstone factor for performance efficiency and success. Also, to better understand the factors identified in this study and how they impact HL operations, there is a need for more studies in other similar developing countries environments. Furthermore, conducting comparison studies on factors affecting HL operations and performance would be valuable to validate results of this study and to increase generalizability.","the case of palestine rafat mahmoud kittaneh executive engineer, institutional development unit an-najah national university, nablus, west bank, palestine kittaneh@najah.edu ayham a.m. jaaron senior lecturer in business and management school of leadership, management and marketing the centre for enterprise and innovation, leicester castle business school de montfort university, leicester, le2 7by united kingdom ayham.jaaron@dmu.ac.uk",
1,Integrating Performance Indicators To Track The Production  Development Of Manufacturing Lines,"lean concepts that many companies use to pursue business goals are based on key performance indicators coming directly from the manufacturing floor. these kpi’s such as availability, efficiency, productivity, throughput, capacities, and changeovers are essential in determining the performance of support and fundamental areas. moreover, engineering management techniques should be applied to educate people to focus their work on these kpi’s. this will definitively ensure positive results to meet the companies goals. once employees are engaged in the specific steps that occur between the process and result, it allows for a better understanding on how to deal with the production bottlenecks that can affect these key indicators. this research intends to provide detailed data about how kpi’s can increase after these key principles are integrated on the manufacturing lines and gain support from management and employees alike. this increase in performance will directly impact the organization and can assist in providing transparency to the areas that need improvement allowing for continuous operations as deemed necessary. following this action plan, with the support from the management team, the manufacturing personnel could benefit from these key performance indicators thus assisting these employees with achieving the organizations goals.","improve, production","The paper has focused on integrating key performance indicators as a new approach to understand manufacturing metrics, accomplish business goals, and inform direct and indirect employees about the performance tracking tools. By using these concepts and the examples shown previously, a new method to analyze business commitments for future projections and forecasts can be achieved based on the existing data collected. Looking for improvements in the manufacturing floor is always required for continuous operation and monitoring consistency. Once targeted goals are achieved, new goals must be established to always look for opportunities and boost production aspects. Using visual management boards provides an excellent alternative to describe the monthly performance and present a structured design of metrics. Further research on how implementing other factors or metrics to the process can be developed. Additional usage of these of these guidelines by different audiences can assist in the development of additional metrics’ and baselines.

2,Implementing The Overall Equipment Effectiveness Metric  In An Industrial Manufacturing Environment,"manufacturing shops that utilize computer numerical control (cnc) machines often need a way to measure the performance of the manufacturing process. overall equipment effectiveness (oee) is the standard measurement used and this paper will explore the steps required to implement the oee metric as well as ways to improve the performance of a machine shop utilizing the metric. it will explain the metric itself, the various formulae that comprise it, and some the technologies available to implement it. example data will be used to present a before and after scenario that shows the usefulness of the oee metric and how it considers quality, performance, and availability of a single machine, or an entire machine shop. expected results of this study are a quantitative review that show how a machine shop can increase its performance by focusing on specific aspects that make up the oee number. as oee gets closer to 100%, the machine shop should be shown to create more good quality parts faster than it had at a previously lower number. automation of the calculations will also be discussed, as well as the logic that determines what state a machine is in during the manufacturing process.","oee, utilization, quality, machine state","Proper implementation of OEE can provide a consistent metric that encompasses a wide range of measurements applicable to engineering managers and higher management of an organization. By having a single number that incorporates the availability, the performance efficiency, and the quality of output of a machine, engineers will have the tools they need to choose projects based on the best returns. Managers and senior leadership can easily understand the metric and use it as a snapshot over a period to determine how their machine shop is performing. As seen in the above example of the Toshiba CNC machine measurements, small changes in any of the three key measurements can have large impacts on the final OEE number. Even with 100% in quality, the machine did not meet JIPM standards for world class OEE and this can be attributed to the slight underperformance in availability and the severely lacking performance metric. However, just because the standards weren’t met doesn’t mean that the OEE for that machine was necessarily bad, and many organizations would struggle to achieve the OEE numbers that Toshiba already has. The point of OEE is not to grade on a pass or fail, but to continuously improve upon the standards and processes already in place. Toshiba could even adjust their definition of quality to be more stringent, therefore lowering their overall quality and OEE number, but allowing them to be even more competitive in the manufacturing industry if they were able to improve upon what is currently considered 100% good quality products. With technological improvements happening at a quicker rate than ever before, the “industry moves faster, the period of change or innovation is shorter, the decision must be made in less time, that is why tools should be used to help identify losses caused during a production process” (Ng Corrales et al.2021). OEE is one of these tools that allows for faster communication of problems withing a machine shop, as well as identifying the specific area that needs to be addressed to solve these problems.","alexandr m. sokolov, niamat ullah ibne hossain, aaron storms, and brian merrill engineering management and construction management college of engineering and computer science, arkansas state university state university, ar 72467, usa asokolov@astate.edu, nibnehossain@astate.edu, aaron.storms@smail.astate.edu, brian.merrill1@smail.astate.edu",
3,Utilizing Dmaic Process To Identify Successful Completion  Of Srad Phases Of Waterfall Development,"the systems requirements analysis (sra) and system architecture design (sad) (often combined into one acronym srad) phases of projects in the waterfall development cycle often pass-through design gates without proper pass/fail criteria. in addition, completion of project designs is often put off onto later design phases (preliminary design and critical design) in favor of meeting schedule/budget early in the project lifecycle. currently in industry, schedule, and budget dictate project phase completion over proper metric tracking/utilization. this is normally due to the fluidity of the design in early phases of project development. this thinking can be dangerous for organizations/industries as it consistently leads to defects late in the development cycle where fixes are costly. it is cheaper to change designs and defects as early in a design as possible. this paper will outline the dmaic (define, measure, analyze, improve, control) process to help track completion of the srad phases for proper completion of design review phase gates. by using dmaic, projects will also be able to reduce latent defects in designs that can become costly to projects in later design phases such as testing, and production. these phase gate completion metrics can be implemented and refined, as the dmaic process is an ongoing methodology.","dmaic, waterfall, srad","One of the major problems a waterfall project faces starting out is moving through early design gates with an incomplete design. This is a preventable problem. As discussed, ending the SRA and SAD phases early can lead to defects showing up later in the design process where it is more costly to fix, as proved by (Widerman, 2001). To prevent defects embedded in the design architecture metrics must be kept, by utilizing preexisting infrastructure within most requirement management tools. By iterating and tracking CONOP and requirement progress and iterations, project teams can better understand their progress within a waterfall phase and be less susceptible to early phase completion from budget, or schedule pressures.","niamat ullah ibne hossain, alexandr m. sokolov, tim petersen, and brian merrill engineering management and construction management college of engineering and computer science arkansas state university state university, ar 72467, usa asokolov@astate.edu, nibnehossain@astate.edu, timothy.petersen@smail.astate.edu, brian.merrill1@smail.astate.edu",
4,An Economic Analysis For Residential Rooftop Solar  Photovoltaic Panels In The State Of Texas,"the renewable energy industry in the united states is growing at record rates. in the last decade, more renewable energy has grown in terms of capacity as well as demand because of the population growth and the need for environmentally friendly energy resources. solar energy is one of the most promising renewable energy sources in texas because of the climate and solar resource potential. with the continuous growth and advances in the industry, homeowners can install solar rooftop photovoltaic (pv) systems for electricity generation instead of relying on the power grid. while the environmental benefits of solar energy are of importance and urgency, the economic benefits for homeowners are still to be determined. this research represents an economic assessment of a 7-kw residential rooftop solar system with a 3kw/6kw storage bank, in the state of texas based on economic parameters such as the internal rate of return (irr), the payback period (pp), and the net present value (npv). these rooftop pv systems are installed on single-family residences and is economically beneficial in the state of texas. these systems resulted in an npv of $6333.01, irr of 8.61%, pp of 13 years, which is an economic benefit to texas homeowners.","energy savings, payback period","This study examines the financial performance of a rooftop PV system in single-family homes in Texas. The costs and parameters used in this paper are only intended to represent the state of Texas and are not valid for other states within the United States due to the changes in costs, average residential energy consumption, electricity rates, and availability of solar resources. The environment impacts of the PV systems is not taken into consideration into this study, the profitability of the rooftop PV system is investigated from a purely economic perspective. The results of this study can be used for other types of homes and other PV systems sizes by using the average PV system costs provided in the analysis, as well as the average electricity rates in the state of Texas only. It can be used as a basis of financial or economic analysis for homeowners interested in adding a residential PV system to their residential properties to ensure their addition will be economically beneficial.","alexandr m. sokolov, niamat ullah ibne hossain, ahlam safouhi, and brian merrill engineering management and construction management college of engineering and computer science arkansas state university state university, ar 72467, usa asokolov@astate.edu, nibnehossain@astate.edu,ahlam.safouhi@smail.astate.edu, brian.merrill1@smail.astate.edu",
5,Effective Capacity Planning For Operations In A Contract  Manufacturing Setting,"capacity planning is one of the most challenging yet important activities for manufacturing companies. several different forms or resources are required for operation, including both humans and equipment. each of these resources has a finite capacity and must be allocated to address various projects. spikes and lulls in resource usage result in inefficiencies, timeline delays, and reduced profitability. understanding a manufacturing company’s resource capacities, planning their upcoming work, and strategically allocating those resources are essential for optimizing its production. this becomes an even more daunting task in a contract manufacturing setting because the company is reactionary to its customers’ placement of orders. it is rare to foresee the exact amount of incoming work, so how can contract manufactures improve their capacity planning to avoid drastic lulls and spikes in resource utilization? customers may provide a demand forecast to the manufacturer, but this is not frequently available. the manufacturer may also attempt to draw insight from customer order patterns, but this can only usually be attempted on a few high- order products. multiple departments must be involved and provide input into forecasting, and the results affect multiple departments as well. however forecasting is accomplished, this expected workload must be systematically added to existing workload to understand the best way to allocate resources, take on or refuse new projects, and invest in resource capacity expansion. this paper aims to advise contract manufacturers on methods and metrics to effectively level-load their shops and increase their productivity levels.","resource allocation, level-load","Capacity planning is a highly beneficial, but equally difficult exercise for contract manufacturing companies. Given that the manufacturer is typically in a reactionary position, it can often be a scramble to allocate the necessary resources required to accomplish tasks with the customer’s timeframe. This reactionary position can result in drastic lulls and spikes in workload. An inconsistent workload will cause inefficiencies that negatively impact productivity, performance, and profitability. Preemptively allocating those resources to anticipated incoming tasks would allow a company to better level its workload. Forecasting of incoming work can come directly from a customer. A customer-provided forecast is not always provided. However, when available, it can be assumed that the forecast is fairly accurate due to the customer’s insight into projected product demand. A manufacturer may be able to devise its own forecast of incoming orders by reviewing order history of certain products. Especially when referring to products that have a substantial order history, routine purchasing frequencies, and low market demand volatility, patterns may be noticed. These patterns can be used to anticipate future customer orders. A salesperson may also be able to provide insight to future demand fluctuations based on their market intelligence and customer interactions. A vendor-managed inventory system can be implemented for high-demand products. This allows a manufacturer to strategically utilize its resources to meet future product demand. It can choose to maximize efficiency by reducing setups and teardowns, or level-load its resources by making the product during lulls in other work. Once forecasts are devised, they must be effectively utilized. Adding anticipated workload to existing workload in an enterprise resource planning system is the most effective method of visualizing the expected resource demands. Engineering managers can then make decisions to strategically allocate these resources or invest in resource capacity expansion. Department managers can offer overtime or training sessions to account for spikes and loads in workload. New employees made be added to support a permanent increase in demand. Executive managers can mitigate the risks of investment in new equipment, resulting in sustainable company growth.","alexandr m. sokolov, niamat ullah ibne hossain, cameron d. nick, brian merrill engineering management and construction management college of engineering and computer science arkansas state university state university, ar 72467, usa asokolov@astate.edu, nibnehossain@astate.edu, cameron.nick@smail.astate.edu, brian.merrill1@smail.astate.edu",

7,Using Advanced Metering Infrastructure Data To Detect And  Improve Customer Voltage Quality Issues,"advanced metering infrastructure (ami) is being adopted worldwide by electric utilities because of the benefits offered by the automated meter data it provides. the utility industry has been exploring methods to best leverage the abundance of ami data now available to maximize customer power quality and develop delivery efficiencies to reduce customer electricity rates. utilities are required by regulations to provide power at voltage levels within a set bandwidth of the nominal delivery voltage to the customer. variances in the voltage delivered by utilities can cause a multitude of issues for the individual customer and for the entire distribution grid system. ami meters are capable of providing voltage data at frequent time intervals, a 1-hour interval sample and 15-minute interval sample are quite common. a dmaic process can be developed to allow an electric utility to appropriately review and act upon the ami voltage data available. in this paper the voltage specifications will be defined (d) and measurement (m) of data explained. analysis (a) of the abundant data is an area of significance. suggestions are made from the analysis to improve (i) the utility management of voltage issues and control (c) the distribution grid to better maintain within specifications.","electric utilities, voltage, power quality, distribution","This paper presents a method to implement a DMAIC process for an electric utility to make use of AMI data to detect and improve voltage deviations in customer service voltage. Several potential causes for the voltage issues are presented, along with discussion of future grid modernization efforts that are expected to increase instability, magnifying the importance of a good detection and improvement program. A universal method is presented to use AMI data to initially locate problematic areas and then use meter recording devices to show confirmation that a voltage deviation of regulatory duration has occurred. Statistical methods are employed to allow for a practical understanding of the relationship between the AMI and field recorder data. The validated data is then used to continue with the DMAIC process to analyze the causes of the deviations. The improvements available range from equipment setting changes, to physical removal and reinstallation of transformers. Removal of services from overloaded transformers has proven to eliminate voltage problems. Industrial distribution problems may be more involved and problems from unstable modern devices like EV charging and renewable power contribution may require major distribution system redesigns and significant capital investment. The process recommendation is to implement KPIs to monitor effectiveness and maintain process gains into the future. Engineering management is an ideal field to lead the implementation of such a program and the methods used in an engineering management program are used in this paper. A program to detect and improve voltage violations will result in improved customer satisfaction with the utility, less risk of damage to equipment, and cost savings as the utilities deploy systems to reduce overall system peaks with frequent monitoring intervals ensuring customers remain in specification. A clear improvement in overall customer voltage quality is seen one year after implementation of this proposed program at an electric utility.","niamat ullah ibne hossain, alexandr m. sokolov, scott karbon, brian merrill engineering management and construction management college of engineering and computer science arkansas state university state university, ar 72467, usa nibnehossain@astate.edu, asokolov@astate.edu, scott.karbon@smail.astate.edu, brian.merrill1@smail.astate.edu",
8,The Application Of Project Management Principles During  The Construction Phase Of A Parking Lot Replacement,"the objective of this paper is to outline a project path for the construction of a new parking lot in an air route traffic control center (artcc). a conceptual framework is presented to guide the discussion based on how different project management (pm) tools were used throughout the project. a detailed explanation highlighting the challenges that were faced during the project execution phase and some of the lessons learned from the project are presented in this report. this article shows how pm principles were used to find the solutions for different problems during different stages of the project. it shows how a parking lot construction project can be managed by using different pm tools such as scheduling, and work breakdown structure (wbs). it highlights on some of the most used terms in the construction industry that includes scope of work, change orders, request for information (rfi), etc. this article reflects that with the use of project management techniques it can assist with an efficient yet goal-oriented project.",,"It can be concluded from the study that the principles of PM used during each step of the project life were very helpful in the successful completion of the project. A team of qualified individuals having proper planning and resources in place were able to achieve the project goal successfully. These principles of PM can be used on any type of project but in the case of this construction projects it could’ve been the deciding factor in whether the project was deemed a success or a failure. It is important to formulate ideas and communicate them with other team members. Having a documented plan can help move the project in the right direction as this plan can be effectively communicated and the goals and objectives are easily identifiable. The study made it clear that the objectives can and will change during the life of the project. The goal should be to follow the plan as close as possible with the knowledge that adjustments will be made. This research suggests that when considering any changes to the objectives, this change should be analyzed and discussed on how it will affect the overall success of the project.

9,Analyzing Sense And Avoid Requirements To Integrate  Unmanned Aircraft Systems Into Controlled Airspace,"the rapid adoption of increasingly affordable and capable unmanned aircraft systems (uass) has highlighted their current value and future potential in a wide variety of applications across many different industries. most study to date has focused on the most affordable and prolific class of small uas which are legally restricted to flight in the limited low-altitude uncontrolled portion of the national airspace system. larger and more capable group 3 and 4 uass, as defined by the u.s. department of defense, are capable of operating in expanded flight envelopes, but current regulations prohibit unmanned flight in controlled airspace under the more dynamic visual flight rules that require independent deconfliction referred to as “sense-and-avoid”, which are required for the maturation of future civil and commercial uas applications. this paper quantitatively analyzes the safety concerns and current mitigation efforts surrounding the proposed incorporation of larger group three and four uass into controlled airspace under visual flight rules and concludes with recommendations for additional measures required to safely allow for future ubiquitous operation.","airspace, cooperative, controlled","As the backbone of the FAA’s NextGen program, ADS-B provides a promising primary means of near-real time telemetry data for use in autonomous DAA systems in UASs. However, an avoidance system solely reliant on ADS- B data presents an unacceptably high frequency of incident due to failed or untimely message delivery. To mitigate this risk and bring the probability of incident under the historical VFR near-MAC incident rate, a pulse-Doppler radar is proposed with a beamwidth of 140° degrees for the detection of non-cooperative aircraft. This proposed dual-source DAA system would safely allow for the integration of UASs into dynamic controlled airspace under VFR with an estimated probability of incident well below historical rates. It is important to highlight the criticality of a rigorous certification process for any UAS collision avoidance systems, analogous to current avionics certification processes. Where in a manned aircraft when all mechanical and electrical systems fail the pilot presents a final level of safety, a UAS is wholly dependent on constant successful operation of its avoidance systems and sensors to avoid other aircraft and not cause undue risk to persons or property. Redundancy is therefore vital in a UAS to ensure that any singular system or sensor failure does not cripple its ability to sense and avoid. As a last resort, standardized procedural deconfliction measures, such as having the UAS fly to a predetermined safe location and loiter indefinitely upon critical system failure, would further reduce risk.","niamat ullah ibne hossain, alexandr m. sokolov, joshua d. roseler and brian merrill engineering management and construction management college of engineering and computer science arkansas state university state university, ar 72467, usa asokolov@astate.edu, nibnehossain@astate.edu, joshua.roseler@smail.astate.edu,, brian.merrill1@smail.astate.edu","references for systems-thinking

10,Development Of An Inventory Management Program For  Warehouse Storage Of Raw Materials In A Continuous,"raw materials are the key to every manufacturing process, without raw materials or with inadequate quantities the entire production system could be in jeopardy. this is true for continuous manufacturing processes because the entire production system may be in a chemical manufacturing facility the packaging materials are equally if not of more importance than the raw material inputs since without adequate packaging materials to package the finished product there is no need for process inputs. the goal of manufacturers is to produce a maximum quantity of finished goods while ensuring customer satisfaction, which in turn maximizes profits. an efficient inventory management program is critical to maximizing production capabilities of a continuous production process, while minimizing production deficiencies. the objective of this study is to ensure proper levels of onsite supplies and/or materials while eliminating the issues that arise with the overstocking and/or under-stocking of these required inventoried items. although there are several aspects that contribute to the controlling of onsite inventory throughout the production processes, the uncertainties affiliated with the supply chain, unprecedented inventory costs, and fundamentals of inventory are the greatest variables that effect any inventory management system. these components are analyzed and optimized to create an adequate program for inventory management within the manufacturing environment.","raw materials, manufacturing, packaging","The supply chain issues are the most difficult to overcome due to the number of players involved in the chain, upstream and downstream from the manufacturer. Additionally, supply chain is maintained on a global scale and must be addressed likewise, leading individual sites to have to adjust to allow for the variable lead times and other supply chain impacts when managing inventory. Although the site cannot directly affect the supply chain, the impacts of it can be seen directly at the site, from inconsistent lead times to delayed delivery of products to customers. These things can be exceedingly difficult for the company since the cost of the raw materials has already been spent, however the raw materials may not be received until several months later affecting the company’s cashflow. Some of the key components that contribute to the uncertainty associated with the supply chain include, lead times, delivery conditions, transit times, demand, and manufacturing production delays or rework (Lee 1992). The initial step that must be made to reduce these supply chain issues would be to identify the exact sources of variability and to track the extent to which each of these variables affect the site specifically (Lee 1992). The site currently maintains and responds to supply chain uncertainty well by adjusting inventory levels to prevent potential stockouts, to make a more effective inventory management program the site must directly address the root causes of the supply issues starting with the addressing suppliers directly (Lee 1992). Although this may be easier said than done in an industrial manufacturing facility, every step in the right direction can only help move away from the current ineffective system. An improved inventory management system, or an improvement in the integration of an existing inventory management system could provide cost savings, overcome an unreliable supply chain, and increase sustainability of the production system.","chemical manufacturing system to prevent production deficiencies niamat ullah ibne hossain, alexandr m. sokolov, hannah v. turner, and brian merrill arkansas state university engineering management and construction management college of engineering and computer science arkansas state university state university, ar 72467, usa asokolov@astate.edu, nibnehossain@astate.edu, hannah.turner@smail.astate.edu, brian.merrill1@smail.astate.edu","references for systems-thinking

11,A Novel Framework To Conduct Sale   Forecasting  And Performance Assessment For International,"forecasɵng sales revenues for global airlines is challenging in pracɵce because the pandemic since 2019 results in abrupt declines. due to lockdown of borders, non-essenɵal travels are prohibited to stop the spread of coronavirus. recently, several countries reopen their borders to fully vaccinated travelers and allow their business or leisure travels. in pracɵce, sales forecasɵng for airlines is closely related to market demand and capacity planning for ﬂeets. to the best of our knowledge, rare studies addressed the selecɵon of key predictors composed of domesɵc economic indicators, global market condiɵons, and individual ﬁrms. to facilitate research gaps, this study spanning from 2006/q1 to 2021/q4 collects mulɵnaɵonal airlines composed of cea and csa in china, ca and eva in taiwan, and jal and ana in japan. industrial cases show internaɵonal passengers and oil price are two common factors to aﬀect sales revenues. due to the emerging demand for cargo shipping, ca and eva perform the best in operaɵonal eﬃciencies during the pandemic. the required reducɵon of full-ɵme employees and operaɵng expenses are respecɵvely suggested. increasing revenue and rpk (revenue-passenger-kilometer) are speciﬁcally criɵcal for cea and ana.","sales forecasɵng, machine learning, pandemic, philippines",,"airlines chihhsuan wang national yang ming chiao tung university, chihswang@nycu.edu.tw",
12,13Th Annual International Conference On Industrial Engineering And Operations Management  [Official],"given the increasing concerns about the adverse effects attributable to climate change, two imperatives of the sustainability paradigm are to reduce pollution and co2 footprint, especially in the energy-intensive mining, mineral processing and beneficiation sectors of industry. thus, a major challenge in minerals processing is to optimize the energy consumption of unit operations. in principle, this requires the utilization of all data and information that fully characterize the dynamics of all material and physical elements which constitute the organization that operates an ore crushing and screening process. by analyzing available data and information, this paper highlights how the variability in ore quality influences the energy of crushing and screening operations in a case study comminution facility. the empirical findings reinforce the need to apply robust models based on implementation of 4ir technologies to provide better information for decision making; in this case, towards continuous optimization of energy consumption to lower pollution and the co2 footprint of comminution unit operations.","data analytics, energy efficiency, co2 reduction",,"analysis of ore variability influence on comminution energy efficiency mpho selepe and joe amadi-echendu department of engineering and technology management university of pretoria, south africa joe.amadi-echendu@up.ac.za","References

13,Modeling The Relationship Between Overtime Rate And  Manufacturing Kpis: A Case Study In The Osat,"the study aims to understand how collected data from the assembly wire bond manufacturing line and enterprise systems can lead to insights regarding the relationship of overtime rate to manufacturing kpis: output attainment, utilization, and absenteeism. using crisp-dm as the data mining methodology, approximately 3.8 million records for attendance, 25.7 million for lot transactions, and 546.2 million for machine utilization were extracted, transformed, and summarized into weekly buckets, resulting in three hundred fifteen (315) samples from the five (5) selected packages, representing 97% of the total volume. the samples were subjected to multiple linear regression and pearson correlation to determine whether there was a significant relationship between overtime rate and the manufacturing kpis. results show that overtime rate exhibits a statistically significant relationship with all the variables (p < 0.05) for the overall setup. violations of the regression assumptions are probably due to model misspecification: other variables can more effectively explain the behavior of the overtime rate, as indicated by the low r-squared values. in contrast, only selected variables are considered significant across the results by package. these differences can be attributed to the different environmental conditions of semiconductor processes and manufacturing lines.","big data analytics, overtime rate, absenteeism, utilization","and Future Research Using three hundred fifteen (315) samples gathered from the five (5) selected packages, representing 97% of the total volume, the authors have performed Multiple Linear Regression and Pearson Correlation to determine whether there was a significant relationship between Overtime Rate and the following manufacturing KPIs: Absenteeism, Attainment, and Utilization. With the results obtained from Multiple Linear Regression, it can be concluded that Overtime Rate exhibits a statistically significant relationship with all of the aforementioned variables for the overall setup. In contrast, only selected variables are considered significant across the regression models by package. Pearson Correlation also revealed that each setup resulted in various behaviors between the response and the predictors. These differences can be attributed to the different environmental conditions of semiconductor processes and manufacturing lines. Violations of the regression assumptions are probably due to model misspecification, which indicates that other variables can more effectively explain the behavior of the overtime rate, as indicated by the low R-squared values. To properly model the Overtime rate in the OSAT manufacturing industry, the authors advise looking into additional production KPIs and process environmental factors, such as the man-machine ratio (MMR), machine output rate, cycle time, or machine count. In order to adequately normalize the data and provide more reliable statistical modeling, it is also advised to incorporate additional samples. 114","manufacturing company using crisp-dm jonathan d. mondero associate professor college of business administration and accountancy graduate studies in business de la salle university - dasmariñas cavite, philippines jdmondero@dlsud.edu.ph jonathan anthony c. ac-ac , shenalie m. lopena college of computer studies, graduate school de la salle university manila, philippines jonathan_ac-ac@dlsu.edu.ph, shenalie_lopena@dlsu.edu.ph christopher josh a. cuevas college of engineering, university of santo tomas manila, philippines christopherjoshcuevas@gmail.com","References

16,Multi-Objective Optimization Of Airport Gate And Aircraft  Assignments,"as the world recovers from the pandemic, the demand for air travel is also slowly recovering to pre-pandemic levels. however, complaints are filed here and there regarding the inefficiencies in different aspects of the aviation industry. one of them is the hassle in the proximity of the boarding gate assignments. there are several factors that affect boarding gate assignments in airports, such as availability, capacity, location, turnaround time, departure and arrival time, operating costs, etc. when mistakes happen, delays and difficulties follow, also causing a domino effect in the airlines’ flight schedule as a whole. in this study, a mixed integer linear programming model is developed to minimize waiting or idle times for the airplanes, as well as passenger walking distance. in decreasing these idle times, associated costs can also be lowered and flight schedules can be made more stable and efficient. this could increase the customer satisfaction from the passengers, which eventually leads to customer loyalty, good word-of-mouth, and returning customers. an hypothetical case study is solved to demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed model. a goal programming approach is used to efficiently optimize the system’s objectives simultaneously. finally, a scenario analysis is performed to understand the behavior of the system under varying conditions.","optimization, air[port gate, airport assignment, availability",,"jarvy larz san juan, jeremy gabriel uy, jayne lois san juan* department of industrial and systems engineering, de la salle university, 1004 manila, philippines *corresponding author: jayne.sanjuan@dlsu.edu.ph",

19,Major Challenges To Formal E-Waste Management Systems  In Developing Countries,"most third-world nations struggle mightily to establish functional e-waste management systems. electrical and electronic equipment (eee) surpluses from developed countries are easily exported to developing countries and largely populated countries. after its end of life (eol), the transported and their own generated eee becomes e- waste, a growing source of concern for developing countries. because of the serious consequences to people's health and the environment, informal e-waste management techniques have emerged as a major challenge for authorities and other interested parties in developing countries like india. in developing nations, there are few formal recyclers and legislation to manage e-waste, which gradually reduces the harmful impact on the environment. nonetheless, there have been various impediments to the endeavour to embrace a formal e-waste management system. the research aims to catalogue and rank the most significant challenges (impediments) faced by the formal e-waste management system in developing countries. a dematel (mcdm) approach is applied to eleven impediments which are identified by extensive literature review and institutional experts’ opinions. the study determined that ""lack of awareness of the harmful effects of unregulated e-waste recycling,"" ""low incentive package for formal e-waste recovery,"" ""lack of training empowerment,"" ""insufficient funds for a formal e-waste recycling management system,"" ""lack of corporate social responsibility initiatives,"" and ""lack of awareness of the cost of returning in formal e-waste recycling"" were the most significant and influential causes of the problem. also, the factor found to be most effective for the current formal e-waste management system is the “large ideal duration for formal e-waste value recovery.” this research has the potential to help policymakers in a developing nation with a large population create an effective e-waste management system.","dematel, impediments, e-waste","of this study regarding possible impediments to e-waste management may serve as a thorough checklist for tackling all the most significant issues in this field. Second, our study illuminates the several dimensions of e-waste management that policymakers must consider. This will assist policymakers in examining all important aspects and their impacts, so enabling the establishment of enhanced and long-term strategies for formal e-waste management. The structural decision model proposed, which is based on DEMATEL, enables the discovery of these tangential relationships between distinct impediments. The ramifications of these findings for management and practice in formal sectors are significant. The study begins by identification of the impediments to the understanding of essential characteristics that have an impact on formal e- waste management systems. The conclusions of this research regarding possible impediments to formal e-waste management may serve as a full checklist. Second, our study illuminates the multiple aspects of e-waste management that policymakers must consider. In order to fulfil the requirements of formal e-waste management systems in developing countries, this will also assist policymakers in examining all relevant aspects and their impacts so they may make educated, strategic decisions. The proposed structural choice model, which relies on DEMATEL, facilitates the identification of causal links between diverse impediments. The research also provides a framework for policymakers to consider the many obstacles to formal e-waste management. The primary objective of the e-waste management system is to minimize costs, ensure that waste is properly used to develop resources, reduce environmental contamination, and increase e-waste recovery operations and revenue. The following suggestions are made for the improvement of formal e-waste challenges in developing nations, based on the aforementioned findings: • The government must organize, at regular intervals, campaigns to raise awareness of e-negative waste's environmental impact. • Collectors of formal e-waste should recruit local garbage pickers/collectors to improve the supply of formal e-waste to formal recycling services. The integration of existing informal e-waste management collectors and recycling facilities may lessen the environmental impact. • The government should give appropriate incentives for e-waste management methods and collectors so that a motivating atmosphere may be maintained via them. 6. Conclusion This research aims to identify and analyse the impediments to successful formal e-waste management in developing countries. Key impediments to the proper management of electronic waste have been identified by analysing the existing literature and inputs from domain experts. Their interaction strengths were analysed using the DEMATEL framework, and the resultant e-waste impediments were categorized according to their natures (cause and effect). The study determined that ""Lack of awareness of the harmful effects of unregulated e-waste recycling,"" ""Low incentive package for formal e-waste recovery,"" ""Lack of Training empowerment,"" ""Insufficient funds for a formal e-waste recycling management system,"" ""Lack of corporate social responsibility initiatives,"" and ""Lack of awareness of the cost of returning in formal e-waste recycling"" were the significant and influential causes of the problem facing by the formal e-waste management system. For successful formal e-waste management, governments must pay greater attention to the obstacles. Due to the influence, it might have on the overall structure, the establishment of a barrier between cause groups is essential. Moreover, this study's results have consequences for the infrastructure of e-waste management. From effect segment, “Large Ideal duration for formal e-waste value recovery,” “Limited human resources for formal recycling centres,” “Insufficient supply of e-waste at formal recycling centres,” “Less formal e- waste collectors/Pickers,” “High setup and operational cost” are found effective for the management of formal e-waste sectors. 145","varun kumar, om ji shukla department of mechanical engineering, national institute of technology patna patna, india 800006 varunk.ph21.me@nitp.ac.in, omjishukla.me@nitp.ac.in","References

20,Kpi Analysis And Application   James C. Chen,"key performance indicators (kpis) are the mainstream performance measurement methods for enterprises nowadays. the results measured by kpis provide a key point for enterprises to improve strategically and operationally as well as highlight an analytical basis for decision-making. by quantifying the key parameters defined by the enterprise itself within a certain period of time, the indicators that are able to reflect the current state and performance can be obtained. this study aims to provide a tree-like kpi structure with a clear definition and hierarchical relationship for enterprises to identify and analyze performance. through a comprehensive literature review, a multi-level kpi structure that combined a group of 34 kpis that was introduced in iso22400 and other important indicators in related literature is proposed. besides, the supporting elements used for calculating kpis are also defined in this study for investigating the relationships and connections between different kpis. such a study can also enable enterprises to implement a hierarchical intelligent dashboard to visualize a real-time situation based on the proposed kpi structure.","iso22400, formula",,"department of industrial engineering and engineering management national tsing hua university hsinchu, taiwan, r.o.c james@ie.nthu.edu.tw tzu-li chen department of industrial engineering and management national taipei university of technology taipei, taiwan, r.o.c chentzuli@mail.ntut.edu.tw meng-gung li new kinpo group new taipei city, taiwan, roc kyo@kinpo.com.tw kung-chin koo department of industrial engineering and engineering management national tsing hua university hsinchu, taiwan, r.o.c tpekingkoo@gmail.com",
21,Lowering Mean Time To Recovery (Mttr) In Responding To  System Downtime Or Outages: An Application Of Lean Six,"the longer a software or computer system service is down, the more it costs the it organization and the more frustrated users become. the purpose of this study is to identify the factors that are responsible for the high-resolution timekeeping capabilities in responding to system downtime or outages. a lean six sigma dmaic framework is often used in large software companies to improve the speed at which incidents are resolved. this framework follows the dmaic methodology, which stands for define, measure, analyze, improve, and control. the study discusses the potential use of the six sigma methodology to improve the efficiency of an it incident management process. qualitative and quantitative research methods were used to analyze the results obtained from the company's case study. the analysis showed that the use of both methods was beneficial. results show the main reasons for the high mttr are the availability of the engineers or specialists for functional escalation and the skill set of these individuals. this constraint gives a major factor for the delay in the acknowledgment of paging alerts, leads to subsequent reassignments of the critical ticket to another person until someone is available to go online and respond, and contributes highly to resolution time. to improve the high-accuracy time and identify the influencing factors, a cause- and-effect diagram and data analysis were performed using recorded incident tickets that were flagged as a critical or system-wide issues. the statistical analysis of the obtained results showed which factors influence the effectiveness of the process. a predictive model of the dmaic methodology was developed to help predict the resolution time of incident tickets at a company. this model helps to quantify how other factors (such as the severity of the incident, the number of involved parties, and the amount of information available) affect the length of time it takes to resolve an incident.",improvement,"Six Sigma DMAIC methodology has been successful in improving the overall process to reduce the MTTR. This methodology focuses on continuous improvement and strives for continuous improvement. This continuous improvement leads to a shorter MTTR, which in turn leads to a more efficient and effective process. One important point to note in this case is that simple solutions were successful in achieving the desired results, without any additional cost or investment required from the company. The Ease of Doing/Impact Matrix table shows the ease of performing different actions and the impact those actions have. It is a helpful tool for decision-makers who want to know which actions are easiest and most effective. Having clearly defined roles and responsibilities is key to managing incident response and reducing MTTR in this study. The EOC is responsible for managing incidents and adapting and improving the process as necessary. ECT1 is a single point of contact for end users reporting service outages. This group is responsible for classifying incidents and routing them to the appropriate second-line support personnel if the first-line support is unable to resolve the incident. They also monitor repair activities and update users on the incident status. ECT2 technicians typically have more advanced knowledge than first-line support staff. This is because ECT2 technicians have undergone additional training in the field. First-line support staff, on the other hand, are typically less experienced than ECT2 technicians. Therefore, frontline support personnel may be enlisted to help with incidents that first-line support can't resolve. And the Product Specialist and Software Dev Support responders are the main ones responsible for interacting with third-party software or hardware vendors to help quickly restore normal service. From the Statical Data Analysis, it was proven that the selected factors can diminish the hours in resolving system- wide incidents tickets and their impact are significantly relevant in lowering the MTTR. Further, through formulated Ease of Doing/Impact Matrix and Failure Modes and Effects Analysis, we can assure that the implementation plan will be successful as highlights the prioritizing of actions, and risks, and develops countermeasures. Refresher training can help prevent one of the most dangerous incident-response risks: situations in which only one person knows a particular system or technology. Overall, the long-term sustenance plan in lowering the MTTR for this study is to continuously improve the quality monitoring, Leverage AIOps capabilities, Create Centralize SOPs, and Random reviewing and follow-up on previous Critical tickets, this will contribute to maintaining lowering the MTTR and creates best-in-class incident response process of the company. The forecast gives the overall possible MTTR of 4.7102. This is 1.55 lower than the Fiscal Quarter and the desirable value was met as the MTTR is lower than 5.","sigma methodology arnold i. aguilar department of industrial and systems engineering de la salle university manila, philippines arnold_isidro@dlsu.edu.ph",

Jalil, 2Musyrifah Mahmod","in malaysia, the population is increasing rapidly, reaching 32.8 million in 2021, generating a tremendous amount of solid waste, estimated to be 38,427 metric tonnes per day in 2021 (1.17 kg/capita/day). of these, 82.5 percent are disposed in landfills. on top of that, households’ electronic waste estimates– from 463,866 metric tonnes in 2011, almost doubling to 832,692 metric tonnes in 2020. the use of electronic devices has proliferated in recent decades, and proportionately, the number of electronic devices. electronic waste, or e-waste for short, is a generic term embracing various forms of electric and electronic equipment that have ceased to be of any value to their owners. managing weee or e-waste from the source, i.e., households is quite complex and requires a strategic approach from the waste operators. therefore, it is the epitome for the local authorities to design the weee flow from the source so that the waste material is not cross-contaminated with the solid waste residual (general households’ bins). the study used a mixed-methodology approach to addressing the fundamental questions and objectives for the sustainable approach to managing weee from the source. it is expected to address the underpinning concept of the feasible solution in handling this waste stream. the method of inquiry was a qualitative and quantitative approach suitable for a multidisciplinary study (waste; logistics and behaviour). investigating situational and personal factors in tandem to seek the overarching values in addressing human behavior in e-waste recycling from the source. therefore, a holistic framework of the e-waste recapture model (recycling e-waste framework) could be a reference point for stakeholders, including local authorities and e- waste collection operators, which currently was vague and not conclusive.","weee, reverse logistics, recycling, philippines",,"and 3erni salleh awang salleh 1 technology and supply chain excellence institute, school of technology management & logistics, 2 school of computing, universiti utara malaysia, and 3e-idaman sdn.bhd., kedah, malaysia *ezura@uum.edu.my, *corresponding author",
25,Interplay Model Of Technostress Physical Discomfort And  Productivity Among Teaching And Non-Teaching Employees,"several studies have highlighted the impact of technostress and physical discomfort on employees' productivity. with the advent of virtual and flexible learning in the philippines due to the covid-19 pandemic, teaching and non-teaching employees became susceptible to physical discomfort and technostress. the study uses partial least square structural equation modeling (pls-sem) to examine the interplay of technostress and physical discomfort to employees' productivity at mseuf campuses. the study’s participants were the employees of mseuf, including department heads, faculty, and non-teaching employees. the study employed quantitative research with a causal research design to measure the relationship between technostress, physical discomfort, and productivity. using warppls 8.0, the study measured the sampling adequacy using the inverse-square root method and gamma-exponential. also, the measurement model and structural model were evaluated using reliability and validity tests like convergent and discriminant validity. the result shows that technostress positively affects physical discomfort with a moderate coefficient of determination (r2) level. while technostress and physical discomfort significantly and negatively affect employees' productivity, with a moderate level of r2. furthermore, the result implies that during this shift in the educational systems in the philippines, employees must be given enough support and assistance to perform at their full potential to deliver and be productive, despite the different challenges.","physical discomfort, pls-sem, productivity, technostress","In general, the majority of the respondents were teaching personnel from the Main campus; most of them belonged to generations Y (millennials) and Z (iGen), with eight years or less tenure at the University. The respondents are mostly WFH and flexible working arrangements, and the majority are working about 8 hours and below every day. Among the five techno stressors, techno-overload is primarily the concern of the employees. While on the other hand, the majority of the workers experienced lower and central back pain during the WFH. The path analysis revealed a significant relationship among the three constructs, and technostress positively correlates with physical discomfort. In contrast, technostress and physical discomfort have a negative impact on the work productivity of MSEUF employees. The study will prove useful to institutions as they decide how to design nuanced strategies that address technostress and its impact on employees. The findings suggest that reducing technostress effectively reduces physical discomfort, thus improving productivity and job performance in general. However, studies also show that technostress has a good impact; therefore, institutions should aim to understand what each specific type of technostress is ideal for employees to perform well. The results suggest that institutions benefit from using tools such as MS Teams and Zoom Meeting to encourage employee innovation when it comes to techno-overload. Institutions can use education and training to help employees approach techno-overload as a challenge rather than an interference to function positively rather than negatively.

26,Specialized Model And Solution For The Problem Of Mass  Public Transport Type Brt Considering Bus Driver Task,"the difficulties encountered in the solution processes and automation regarding the bus driver problem, has brought mathematical approximations and solutions in real life applications, especially when the system requires those kinds of implementations to find the response in shorter times and less computational effort. the high mathematical complexity found in each mathematical representation of the real problem used by the operating system calls for a novel application of each mathematical representation in one structured algorithm, one that supports the driver scheduling and rostering problem, giving the optimal solution based in good quality factible basic starting points found by the search algorithm to reduce the amount of time and computational memory used. in this work, a first approximation of the combined mathematical model is proposed to analyze the driver scheduling and rostering considering a schedule classification, considers the necessary conditions to fit the bases of 3 different types of approaches to the bdsp problem. the proposed model considers characteristics and especial behaviors found in solutions shown in previous works published in the specialized literature and real-life problems, such as the integra s.a bus driver problem, to create the necessary changes in the mathematical representation to adapt the new valid inequalities to the real problem behavior and ensure its only used when the problems consider it necessary for the real problem. this being the focus point to implement disjunctive valid inequalities in the final proposal. the improve model is solved with a genetic algorithm to start the solution process and reduce the search space. since the proposed disjunctive valid inequalities can be activated or deactivated depending on the variables value, the amount of constrains is reduced to improve the computational behavior and ensures the solution of medium type problems. then the found solution is given to a branch and cut technique to find the optimal solution, considering all the reduce conditions found before. to prove the efficiency of the proposed model and algorithm, two test systems were use, starting with small test systems to prove test the mathematical model and its new representation, then it is tested with a medium type of problem, which can be found in the specialized literature, to test the computational efficiency. in each test the algorithm can find the optimal solution of each problem and reduce the time-effort ration when compared with previous works. 196",,,"programing and rostering with work shifts classification. luis miguel escobar professor and researcher in the engineering department universidad libre seccional pereira pereira, colombia luism.escobarf@unilibre.edu.co laura monica escobar professor and researcher in the electrical engineering department, i+d+i research coordinator universidad tecnológica de pereira pereira, colombia lamoescobar@utp.edu.co rubén iván bolaños, césar a. marín i+d+i coordinator, i+d+i research manager integra s.a pereira, colombia lamoescobar@utp.edu.co",
27,Assessment Of Transmitted Disease Service Readiness In  12 Puskesmas Before And During The Covid-19,"puskesmas must be a reliable health service, so paying attention to its readiness to provide health efforts for the community is necessary. this research aims to compare the readiness of puskesmas in providing services for infectious diseases of hiv/aids, tb, malaria, and stis before the pandemic (2019) and during the covid-19 pandemic (2021). this research was conducted in august-september 2021 in 12 health centers in papua, ntt, south sumatra, and diy provinces. data before the pandemic was obtained from rifaskes 2019, and during the pandemic, it was collected through direct data collection in the field. the data collection tool is in the form of a questionnaire with an adaptation of the service availability and readiness assessment (sara). sara guides the analysis to produce domain values and traceability indicators of the availability and readiness of health services. data were also analyzed by statistical calculation of wilcoxon-signed-rank t-test (non-parametric dependent t-test). the results showed that the average tracking indicator that had decreased was malaria services (9.4%). meanwhile, the average of other traceability indicators has increased, such as hiv/aids services (6.9%), tuberculosis (9.3%), and stis (8.3%). the results of the wilcoxon test showed that there was no significant difference in service readiness for malaria (p=0,144), tuberculosis (p=0,533), and stis (p=0,227); while the readiness of hiv/aids services showed a significant difference (p=0.046). the government can use sara as a basis for monitoring the availability and readiness of services by adapting several tracking variables that are more in line with the indonesian context.","malaria, hiv/aids, tuberculosis","1. The average malaria service has decreased from 2019 by 9.4% in 2021. The indicators of malaria tracking that have decreased are the administration of Artemisinin injection, Artemisinin tablet, Quinine/Kinin tablet/inj, and Primaquinin tablet. The decrease in average occurred in Ogan Komering Ilir Regency and Jayapura Regency. 2. The average HIV/AIDS service at Puskesmas has increased from 2019 to 6.9% in 2021. However, several indicators of HIV/AIDS tracking such as guidelines for the management of HIV/AIDS opportunistic infections, guidelines for Counseling and Testing HIV/AIDS, guidelines for preventing HIV/AIDS transmission AIDS from mother to child, the HIV drug Nevirapine, and HIV CD4 devices have decreased. The decline in the average occurred in the city of Yogyakarta. 3. The average TB service has increased from 2019 by 9.3% in 2021. However, several TB tracking indicators have decreased, such as TB Drugs Isoniazid + Rifampicin tablets and TB Drugs Isoniazid + Rifampicin + Pyrazinamide tablets. The decrease in average occurred in Ogan Komering Ilir Regency, Yogya City, and Southwest Sumba Regency. 4. The average service for sexually transmitted infections has increased from 2019 by 8.3% in 2021. The indicator that has decreased is the administration of injectable procaine penicillin. The decline in the average occurred in Ogan Komering Ilir and Southwest Sumba districts. 5. The Wilcoxon test between the domain mean in 2021 compared to 2019 shows no significant difference in malaria service readiness, tuberculosis service readiness, and STI service readiness.

28,A Mathematical Model For The Assembly Job Shop  Scheduling Problem With Overtime: A Case Study In,"production scheduling affects the cost of production. hence, it is one of the important problems for operational problems. especially for productions that require assembly precedencies, an inappropriate production schedule may be the reason for overtime decisions for a finite planning period. an inappropriate production schedule may lead to tardiness in assembly jobs as subassembly parts may not be ready on time. to meet the deadline of products, tardiness must be compensated using overtime. in this study, we considered an assembly job shop scheduling problem for multi- group jobs with sub-assembly precedence’s from a real-world application. our aim is to determine the production schedule that minimizes overtime for a finite planning time interval. we developed a mixed integer programming model that minimizes the overtime complying with the delivery dates for the problem. we conducted a case-study on a construction machinery industry in thailand. construction machines have several welded body parts with sub- assembly processes. welded body parts with sub-assembly processes have cutting, bending, machining and pre- welding processes. the readiness of the welded body parts before the machine assembly is critically important for the continuity of the machine assembly line.","assembly job shop, overtime",,"construction machinery industry mustafa üstünçelik, hüseyin tunç and çağrı koç department of business administration social sciences university of ankara ulus, altindag/ankara, turkey mustafa.ustuncelik@gmail.com, huseyin.tunc@asbu.edu.tr, cagri.koc@asbu.edu.tr",
29,Platelet Inventory Management With Demand And Supply  Uncertainty And Variable Pricing Considerations,"managing the inventory of blood products is a crucial operation in hospitals owing to the significance of blood in medical treatment. at the same time, blood is characterized by unique attributes, such as perishability and the unpredictable nature of its supply and demand. while mathematical models have been developed to optimize the complex process of blood inventory management, gaps in literature exist in terms of considering the possibility of variable pricing and extensively accounting for uncertainties in the supply chain. in this light, the present study proposes a stochastic multi-period mixed integer linear programming cost minimization model that determines the optimal inventory plan for a hospital purchasing platelets, assuming that prices fluctuate along with the blood center’s supply. to implement uncertain supply and demand, the model considers a discrete set of scenarios for each parameter and decides based on expected values. a hypothetical case study was performed on the model, and the results indicate a promising direction for the research as total inventory costs decreased relative to models without the new considerations. to further improve the proposed model, future studies may view the blood supply chain from a macroscopic perspective and provide a more accurate model of price fluctuations.","blood supply chain, inventory model, variable pricing",,"mary christiene courtney alegre, kevin go chuang, grina kimberly gallardo, cristina beatrice mallari, aaron william sy, dr. jayne lois san juan department of industrial and systems engineering gokongwei college of engineering de la salle university manila, philippines mary_christiene_courtney_alegre@dlsu.edu.ph, kevin_chuang@dlsu.edu.ph, grina_gallardo@dlsu.edu.ph, cristina_mallari@dlsu.edu.ph, aaron_william_sy@dlsu.edu.ph, jayne.sanjuan@dlsu.edu.ph",
30,Adoption Of Automation As A Determinant Of The Physical  Footprint In The South African Banking Institutions,"south african banking institutions are transitioning from the conventional banking operating system to a more automated and digitalised one. banking institutions compete against one another to take control of the market share available in the banking industry. the adoption of automated and digitalised-driven practices has become the norm for banking institutions to serve more customers with fewer resources. the covid-19 pandemic significantly accelerated the rate of adopting automation through digitisation and digitalisation. this paper aims to understand whether the adoption of bank automation is coupled with the trend of the banking institutions' physical footprint. thus, a conceptual research framework was developed to streamline the banking institutions' footprint regarding the interest in adopting automation within the banking industry. the descriptive statistics of the banks' annual integrated reports and fact sheets revealed an overall decrease rate of 19 percent countrywide in the number of banking outlets/branches from early 2015 to the end of 2021 for the five prominent banking institutions in south africa, known as absa, fnb, nedbank, standard bank and most recently capitec bank.","digitalisation, digitisation, physical footprint",,"save akilimalissiga , nita sukdeo and sambil mukwakungu department of quality and operations management university of johannesburg johannesburg, south africa savea@uj.ac.za , nsukdeo@uj.ac.za , sambilm@uj.ac.za",

32,An Exploratory Study On   Museum Visitor Ship Trends In Singapore,"the covid-19 outbreak has unpredictably disrupted the operations of numerous museums. museum visitor experience has a physical, personal, and social context, which are not achievable during the pandemic. despite the depreciation during the circuit breaker period, the disruption also presents an opportunity for local museums to develop new strategies of audience engagement to accommodate the altered audience behavior. this exploratory study analyses data from six singapore-based museums to understand the visitorship patterns across different ages and genders. the impact of covid-19 is also analysed. using r-studio and relevant packages, we conducted statistical tests such as hypothesis testing, chi-square testing and regression. it was concluded that overall, museums attracted a younger demographic compared to the general singapore population, and male visitors were more likely to visit more than once. furthermore, the average number of visitors in the second half of 2020, after a nation-wide covid-19 stay-home order, was found to be statistically greater than the average number of visitors before. an interactive r shiny app was also designed to allow users to explore the visitor profile of each museum.","exploratory study, demographic, covid-19","Over 3.5 years, from June 2017 to December 2020, the trends in Singapore museum attendance have shifted. This study examines consumer behavior and identifies the factors that drive museum-goer demand. This includes the time from the commencement of COVID and the reopening after the stay-at-home measure. The scope of this paper was restricted to museums managed by the NHB. The findings of this study are helpful for comprehending local museum attendance trends by age and gender, as well as the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak. In this regard, it has provided us with crucial new information based on museum data in Singapore. According to the study's findings, museums tend to draw a younger audience. This could represent Singaporeans' preferences or targeted programming. Female visitors predominated. Female visitors chose the museums C2, H2, and H3. While male visitors were underrepresented, they were more likely to return. The data also demonstrates a difference in museum visitor ship trends before and after the Circuit Breaker measure. Following a Circuit Breaker, the average number of visitors in the second half of 2020 was determined to be statistically greater than the average number of visitors prior to the COVID-19 start, particularly among teenagers and females. This suggests a growing preference for in-person museum visits following COVID-19 in Singapore. On the basis of the findings of this article, museums could examine measures to increase their interaction with the young and female visitor segments, hence increasing their accessibility to neighboring tourist segments. Possible extensions of this work could include the addition of similar data from other museums and tourist attractions in Singapore to determine whether Singaporeans tend to visit the same destinations as part of their local tourism during the epidemic.","aldy gunawan liu chentao, heranshan s/o subramaniam, melissa tan, ranice tan, clarence tay, tasaporn visawameteekul school of computing and information systems singapore management university singapore aldygunawan@smu.edu.sg, chentao.liu.2021@mitb.smu.edu.sg, heranshans.2021@mitb.smu.edu.sg, melissa.tan.2021@mitb.smu.edu.sg, ranice.tan.2021@mitb.smu.edu.sg, clarencetay.2021@mitb.smu.edu.sg, tasapornv.2021@mitb.smu.edu.sg",
33,An Empirical Evaluation Of Factors That Affect Efficiency  In Public Procurement,"numerous projects study the factors that have an impact on the efficiency of public procurement systems. the main objective of this research is to use the south african context to identify some of the factors that are critical for better performance and efficiency of public procurement. the research then used structural equation modelling to test the relationships between the identified factors and efficiency, as well as the strength of those relationships. structured questionnaires were sent to selected respondents in public organisations in south africa and the responses obtained were utilised to test the research hypotheses developed. the research found that excessive bureaucracy, compliance, and supplier relationship management have a strong influence on efficiency in public procurement. this study contributes to the understanding of various factors that influence public procurement and the impact of that influence. understanding such factors will assist entities with controlling such factors and improving the efficiency public procurement processes.","quality management, public procurement, goods",,"bongumusa cebekhulu, paul. a ozor, charles mbohwa department of quality and operations management, faculty of engineering and the built environment university of johannesburg johannesburg, rsa musa.ceb@gmail.com ; pozor@uj.ac.za ; cmbohwa@uj.ac.za",
34,Apply The Tiling Technique Of Heterogeneous Computing On  Meta-Heuristics,"with its multicore technology designed for intensive computation, graphics processing units (gpus) have advanced tremendously in recent years. the gpu is a multicore coprocessor with dozens or even hundreds of cores designed for intensive computations, unlike a central processing unit (cpu), which has a limited number of cores available. however, cpus have large caches for accommodating large amounts of data, whereas gpus have smaller caches but use a massive amount of threads. in order to achieve the best performance from both cpu and gpu, gpu-cpu heterogeneous computing architectures have emerged, resulting in a paradigm shift in parallel computing. data parallelism, also known as simd (single instruction, multiple data), is realized through this paradigm, which allows multiple threads to execute the same task simultaneously on different subsets of the same data. when data parallelism is used to program, it is particularly relevant when there is a lot of data to process, as is often the case in scientific computing. due to their inherent nature as intensive computing, data parallelism is ideally suited for meta-heuristics. as part of this research, data parallelism is introduced to meta-heuristics, as well as a particular optimization technique called ""tiling"" in parallel computing. ""tiling"" refers to grouping threads into tiles to share access to programmable caches on gpus in order to improve computation speed, particularly for programs that use the same data repeatedly. we introduce the ""tiling"" technique to ant colony optimization, a meta-heuristic for solving quadratic assignment problem (qap). a heterogeneous computing architecture is expected to provide benefits in speed, quality, and efficiency over a cpu alone.",tiling,,"gary yu-hsin chen department of logistics management national kaohsiung university of science and technology kaohsiung 82445, taiwan garychen@nkust.edu.tw ping-shun chen department of industrial and systems engineering chung yuan christian university chung li 32087, taiwan pingshun@cycu.edu.tw",

36,Sustainable Reverse Logistics Implementation With Triple  Bottom Line Approach,"to explore reverse logistics in the context of the indonesian food and beverage manufacturing industry and examine the effect of the effectiveness of reverse logistics activity on tbl. performance and operational performance. by applying the method of structural equation modeling based on partial least square (sem-pls). recommendations are made to improve the implementation of sustainable reverse logistics. the hypothesis related to the effectiveness of reverse logistics activity, tbl performance, and operational performance is developed. based on data collection, as many as 123 respondents were involved in collecting data by distributing online questionnaires to company stakeholders. findings based on the results obtained show that internal factor capability has no significant effect on the effectiveness of reverse logistics activity, while external factor capability has a significant effect on the effectiveness of reverse logistics activity. the effectiveness of reverse logistics activity has a significant impact on economic performance, environmental performance and social performance. in contrast, the effectiveness of reverse logistics activity does not have a significant impact on operational performance. however, economic performance and environmental performance have a significant influence on operational performance. therefore, the implications of the research results can be input for companies to continue to improve the implementation of reverse logistics in companies. 1. introduction producers are parties that have activities to produce output, both in goods and services, but in the process and finished goods will generate waste in packaging, therefore producers have a big responsibility in solving packaging waste made of plastic they produce as stated in the regulation. reverse logistics as a related process, starting from the point of consumption to the point of origin with the aim of creating value or proper disposal of products/goods in a cost- effective manner includes planning, implementing and controlling efficiently the flow of raw materials, goods in process, finished goods, and information. environmental concerns form the basis for legal pressures, and environmental regulations that steer companies towards sustainable reverse logistics management. but it requires practices that are environmentally and socially sensitive. moreover, environmental applications include investment in pollution control and prevention as well as the implementation of environmental management systems. previous researchers said to address this increasing global concern, gaustad, (2018) that economic policy can be considered as an effective solution that allows by leveraging a circular economy consisting of end-of-life management of a product only so that the product can be brought back into the supply chain by a mechanism that once it has completed its functional life, instead of being considered waste. this research also considers the factor of reverse logistics activities as a main objective, which analyzes what is interfering with the wider adoption of reverse logistics among manufacturers in the nigerian manufacturing sector (u-dominic et al. 2021) . research in bangladesh that reviews perspectives and barriers to adopting green supply chain management practices in the textile context (tumpa et al. 2019) . meanwhile in thailand addressing performance bottlenecks by focusing on identifying and ranking solutions on reverse logistics adoption in the palm oil industry using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision making method (phochanikorn et al. 2020) . research aimed at implementing reverse logistics in finding solutions for the thai electronics industry using structural equation modeling (sem) (p sirisawat 2019) . sem is also used to measure the effects of the three pillars of the triple bottom line (tbl) which include: economic, environmental and social by identifying the antecedents of sustainable product innovation performance (muñoz-pascual et al. 2019) . © ieom society international 260",,"Based on the data processing and analysis that has been done previously, the conclusions that can be drawn are in accordance with the research objectives set at the beginning that the research aims to test the hypothesis. In the research model developed using 7 variables, namely: IFC , EFC , ERL , ECP , EVP, SCP, and OPPs . The 7 variables of the research model produce the 8 research hypotheses that are tested. In this study, recommendations were obtained as an effort to improve companies that can be carried out by companies by increasing the company's reward system for implementing reverse logistics. This study explores that EFC heavily influences ERL . Factor This identified will help managers and academics in decision making . This study relates the TBL aspect where ERL has the highest influence on ECP after EVP and SCP. OPP is not significantly influenced by ERL variables so it must be mediated by ECP variables and EVP variables. It can be concluded that the variables that can drive operational performance in implementing reverse logistics in companies are ECP and EVP. Based on an analysis of reverse logistics activities using the TBL approach, researchers found that there were hypotheses that were not significantly different from previous studies. Researchers found that the IFC hypothesis on ERL has no significant relationship. In contrast to previous studies stating that IFC has a significant relationship to ERL. Researchers found that the ERL hypothesis against OPP has no significant relationship. In contrast to previous studies stating that the ERL variable has a significant relationship to OPP which can be a driving force for improving reverse logistics in companies. This study incorporates the conceptual model from previous studies. But there is no conceptual model or hypothesis directly or indirectly linking IFC and EFC to OPP. Based on the results of the study, it has indirectly linked EFC and IFC to OPP. The results, researchers found that there was a significant indirect relationship to OPP mediated by the ERL and ECP and EVP latent variables. While IFC does not have a significant relationship indirectly.","fahri anwar, erwin widodo, iwan vanany. industrial and systems engineering sepuluh nopember institute of technology (its) surabaya, 60111, indonesian email: fahrianwararif@gmail.com, erwin@ie.its.ac.id, vanany@ie.its.ac.id",
37,Analysis Of The Adoption Decisions Of The Components Of  The Internet Of Things In The Ready-Made Garment Industry,"the ready-made garment (rmg) industry is one of the largest industrial sectors in bangladesh in terms of economy and employment. as the world economy moves forward, this highly people-dense industry needs to be digitalized. however, the importance of digital technology, particularly the internet of things (iot), has just lately been recognized by most industries, which is also an important part of industry 4.0. the iot has seven important elements. though iot has the potential to grow businesses, it is difficult to implement all the elements of iot simultaneously. thus, the study aims to build a hierarchy model of iot elements to be implemented in the rmg industry of bangladesh. through an extensive literature review, fourteen significant elements of iot were identified. then the study employs an integrated multi-criteria decision-making (mcdm) framework to rank the elements of iot based on their potential for application in the bangladeshi rmg industry. the weights of the evaluation criteria were determined using a fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (fahp), and the elements of iot were ranked using a preference ranking organization method for enrichment evaluations (promethee ii) based on the criteria weights obtained from fahp. the study findings suggest that the sensors are the most significant component of iot, while network interconnection is the least significant component for iot implementation. this study is expected to assist the stakeholders in the rmg and other related industrial sectors in formulating appropriate strategies and policies for the proper deployment of iot.","rmg industries, industry 4.0, iot components, fahp",,"md zisanul haque bhuiyan department of industrial and production engineering (ipe) bangladesh university of engineering & technology (buet) dhaka-1000, bangladesh zisanul.rabib@gmail.com a. b. m. mainul bari, ph.d. department of industrial and production engineering (ipe) bangladesh university of engineering & technology (buet) dhaka-1000, bangladesh mainul.ipe@gmail.com",
38,A System Dynamics Approach To Model And Manage Plastic  Waste Pollution,"plastic wastes accumulate over time due to increased usage and improper disposal in the environment. in addition, plastics decompose at a slow rate, causing landfills and oceans be filled with plastic wastes, reducing the space for more wastes. this poses as a threat to the marine environment as oceans become polluted with plastics and harm the organisms residing in the ocean. with the existing plastic waste management and policies, there is a question to whether they are sufficient in managing wastes by reducing their presence in the environment and limiting plastic consumption. the study aims to develop a system dynamics model that will replicate the plastic wastes present in the marine environment and propose solutions on the existing plastic waste management that would limit plastic usage and increase the effiiciency of waste management. it will cover the supply chain of plastic wastes until the disposal process to replicate the system successfully. parameters and scenarios are tested in the model to gather insights on the system behavior. policies or solutions are proposed appropriate to the system that would successfully reduce plastic waste in the oceans. further studies include developing policies that would reduce plastic production, as this is not focused on in this study.","manage, plastic waste, management, ocean, pollution",,"tee, madeline and sy, charlle de la salle university, manila, philippines charlle.sy@dlsu.edu.ph",
39,Evaluation Of Strategies For Rising Sea Levels Using System  Dynamic,"due to human induced global warming, sea levels are increasing globally. from 2006 to 2015, the rate of its increase has more than doubled, from 0.06 inches (1.4 millimeters) per year over the majority of the twentieth century to 0.14 inches (3.6 millimeters) each year. the current reliance on fossil-based socioeconomic system, along with land subsidence and groundwater extraction, are only some of the factors that accelerate the rise of sea levels. different local governments propose adaption measures to aid cities from the effects of rising sea levels but effective policies to combat climate change have been marginal due to the inability to properly conduct an integrated assessment on the different factors that influence climate change . the complexity and dynamic nature of this issue presents difficulties for policy and decision-making processes. system dynamics modeling has proven to be extremely valuable in a variety of sectors for assisting decision-makers in grasping and projecting the dynamic behavior of complex systems to enable the creation of successful policy initiatives. this paper makes use of a system dynamics model to evaluate different adaptation strategies to determine which information and evidence is seen to be relevant for policymaking. results show that efforts to reduce carbon emissions depend heavily on the transition of its energy mix from carbon-rich coal to low-carbon natural gas. temporarily reducing a basin’s water stress through various policy changes can also alleviate groundwater activities and further slow down the rise of sea levels. sensitivity and scenario analyses were also conducted to illustrate “what if” relationships in relation to these policy changes. these results provide relevant information that can be utilized by government bodies around the world. proceedings of the international conference on industrial engineering and operations management manila, philippines, march 7-9, 2023 © ieom society international 286",,,"mansilla, maria mikaela and sy, charlle de la salle university, manila , philippines",

The results of the comparison with the latest adaptive JRP show better results. Thus, the application of JRMIP can become a new standard for benchmarks in future studies. Moreover, JRMIP can work on forecast-based inventory policies, non-forecast-based inventory policies, or a combination of both. The JRMIP procedure can be an innovation in completing a real problem that often uses several inventory policies. Future research from this study can include the development of constraints related to an industry that can apply them specifically to provide better results that are more in line with the industry. The application of JRP in a supply chain is also a challenging topic to develop. Acknowledgments This research is supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan under contract no.

42,Dynamic Lot Sizing Model For Perishable Products In  Animal Pharmaceutical Industry With Quality Deterioration,"optimizing supply chain operations by reducing costs, increasing responsiveness, and remaining competitive in a dynamic environment are important things for pharmaceutical companies. perishable products in pharmaceutical companies make production planning problems more complex. the quality of perishable products is one of the characteristics that need to be considered because perishable products are not static parameters but are very dynamic variables. determining the quantity of products that must be produced in order to reach consumers before the product shelf life runs out is one of the challenges in industries with perishable products. demand fluctuates between periods during the planning horizon requires the model used to be dynamic model in order to represent the reality. dynamic lot sizing will be used in this study which developed by taking quality deterioration into account. the decrease in the quality of perishable products in the study was affected by time, temperature, and humidity. perishable products and backorders can be considered as complementary phenomena because when an item is highly perishable, demand may need to be accommodated to contain costs due to damage, so that losses can be avoided. this study aims to identify production, inventory, and backorder decisions during the planning horizon that will affect the cost of goods manufactured. the cost of goods manufactured is a measure of a company's competitiveness, therefore it is one of the focuses of this research. the cost of goods manufactured for the optimal quantity of production will be compared with the cost of goods manufactured under the existing conditions of the company.",perishable product,"The resulting model is the development of a dynamic lot sizing model with reduced quality for perishable products. Deterioration in models is affected by temperature and humidity. This decrease in quality will affect the amount of production of perishable products. In the dynamic lot sizing model, the objective function is to minimize the total costs incurred within the planning horizon. The decision variables obtained are how much production and backorders are made and the inventory stored in order to produce a minimum total cost. In numerical calculations, there are three conditions that are carried out based on inventory storage which affect temperature and humidity inputs and will have an impact on quality degradation. Storage in a room with an air control device in Condition 1 can regulate temperature and humidity in optimal conditions, namely 25OC for temperature and 40% for humidity. The decrease in quality in Condition 1 was not significant. In Condition 1, the resulting total cost of IDR 509,999,900 is the highest total cost with a production volume of 7,314 units, inventory stored during the Rp509,9 99,884 Rp500,8 44,651 Rp502,5 02,448 Rp490,000,000 Rp493,000,000 Rp496,000,000 Rp499,000,000 Rp502,000,000 Rp505,000,000 Rp508,000,000 Rp511,000,000 Condition 1 Condition 2 Condition 3 Total Cost 308","dira aulia and niniet indah arvitrida department of industrial and systems engineering faculty of industrial technology and systems engineering institut teknologi sepuluh nopember surabaya, 60111, indonesia diraaulia11@gmail.com, niniet@ie.its.ac.id","References

The discussions on the issues of sustainability pertaining to the paper and pulp industry, in the academic world, were studied through the journal-wise and article-wise analysis using bibliometric tool. Further, various challenges for sustainable business practices in the paper and pulp industry, identified from the bibliometric collection were discussed. On the basis of the research outcome, few suggestions of improvement were proposed. From this paper, it is evident that paper and pulp businesses all throughout had major environmental and societal concerns and threats which are ingrained in their business models. However, with rising awareness and concerns not just amongst the society at large, but also amongst the customers and the organisations themselves, several measures to mitigate the adverse effects resulting from the business models of paper and pulp industries are being adopted. Yet, achieving a completely sustainable and environment friendly model of paper making is a far cry. And so, further discussions, propositions and actions, as proposed above, are desired to make the paper making business a net resource contributor to the society from a net resource consumer as per the present time.","biswaksen mishra1 and rajesh kumar singh2 management development institute, gurgaon, india 1fpm22biswaksen_m@mdi.ac.in, 2rajesh.singh@mdi.ac.in",
44,Implementing A Wine Traceability System As An Ethereum  Distributed Application,"undoubtedly, supply chain operations management is becoming more demanding for product tracing due to regulatory frameworks and fraudulent incidents. therefore, rapidly increasing challenges arise in transparency, tracking, and data storage in many product supply chains. especially in the case of wine supply chains, timely and accurate traceability is vital, as this industry is plagued by frequent counterfeiting activities that pose significant risks to both consumer health and business viability and prosperity. blockchain technology can serve as a crucial aid for constructing modern wine supply chains by offering increased security and trust between all supply chain stakeholders. this paper presents a framework for developing ethereum-based blockchain distributed applications and demonstrates a use case for creating such an application for a wine traceability system. the developed distributed application enables the participants of the wine supply chain to track wines by adding and monitoring data about each individual wine bottle's production, fermentation, aging, bottling, and distribution, providing full supervision of its production and distribution. the demonstrated use case shows the different types of users and their interactions with the system to fully comprehend the advantages it can offer to all supply chain stakeholders as well as consumers and controlling authorities.","traceability, blockchain, ethereum",". The utilization of Blockchain technology in the wine supply chain, through Dapps, can provide a solution to the counterfeiting problem through the digitization of the supply chain. The possibility of effective tracking of the respective product, throughout its production and distribution range, in minimal time and at low cost, can be effectively provided. Blockchain significantly reduces the processes required to identify counterfeit or contaminated products since only one record is kept, and traceability is much easier and more immediate. There are of course, some drawbacks, which concern the speed of transactions, the environmental burden, the scalability of the applications themselves, the training of the entities involved as well as the general regulation for data protection, that need to be addressed in the future in order for such a blockchain system to become mainstream. Despite the obstacles in implementing Dapps, it is undeniable that this technology creates a new perspective for supply chain operations. The results of this research include the creation of a framework that is a guide for developing a Dapp and deploying it on the Ethereum Mainnet. The Ethereum platform itself does not limit its functionality to specific toolchains, so the developer can choose from a multitude of options in order to implement their own decentralized application. Thus, the provided framework can be significantly diversified according to the development needs, but its main principles will remain unchanged. In the following stages of our research, the Dapp will be tested in depth in real-world operations on various stakeholders of the wine supply chain, and appropriate improvements will be made to the smart contracts. At the same time, the final Frontend UI will also be designed. Our future goals include adding the NFT concept to the Dapp. More specifically, as the production of wine bottles is finite, each bottle could be assigned an NFT, which the consumer can add to a digital collection after burning each bottle. This creates a more accessible app that may appeal to both collectors and non-collectors, offering an additional motive to participate in this effort to combat counterfeit wine activities. Thus, the role of the end consumer in the decentralized application will gain more value and, at the same time, create a greater incentive to burn the bottle and help maintain the wine's authenticity and traceability.

45,A Logistic Regression Model To Predict The Induction Of  Professional Baseball Players Into The Hall Of Fame,"in recent years, trading of sports cards has created a great attraction among collectors and investors. although sports cards investment is considered for many a high risk, this risk could be reduced creating a long-term portfolio. for example, buying rookie cards (rc) from professional sports players in the early years of his/her career and holding them expecting until they are considered for the hall of fame. however, it is difficult to predict whether a player will likely be nominated for the hall of fame since their career depends on many factors on and off the field. therefore, the purpose of this research is to create a model that helps collectors and investors to predict if a professional sports player will be inducted into a hall of fame (hof). to achieve this aim, the authors focused their work on the baseball game, used the scrum methodology, and analyzed current baseball hall of famer players performance statistics. the final logistic regression model consisted of seven independent variables and predict the induction of current baseball players in the hof with an accuracy of 98 percent.","baseball, scrum, agile","While progressing through the sprints, the metrics used got closer to the expected results of the model. When comparing it to the other current models we realized that our model surpassed their final results (see Table 9). Compared to the model of Springer we used fewer variables and got better accuracy. One important finding was not to use the Silver Slugger award, contrary to Springer’s model because this award was only given after 1980.

48,"International Conference On Industrial Engineering And Operations Management Manila, Philippines,  Application Of Value Stream Mapping As Lean Tool Along","value stream mapping (vsm) is an initial and critical tool for deploying lean concepts in manufacturing and service sector including hospitals. radiology department receives diverse inputs and provides vast range of services which make this system complex and challenging to optimize. in developing countries where hospitals are oppressed by high patient load, crowded receptions and waiting areas due to long patient waiting time create hindrance in other operations as well. therefore, the aim of this research is to analyze the working environment of a public sector hospitals’ radiology department; as a case study, identify the bottleneck and waste in operations by mapping the current patient flow, and propose system improvements with the help of arena simulation. use of simulation allow experimenting with different scenarios and make predictions about the outcomes, without changing the complex systems in reality. this study is based on the data collected for 15 days, through doctors and staff interviews and direct observation (gemba walk). patients requiring radiology services are classified as routine and procedure patient, with later need an appointment for the consultation after procedure. the research work is divided into two distinct phases: during the first phase waste checklist was developed using 5 why approach followed by ishikawa diagram to identify the potential causes of long waiting time. the vsm tool mapped the current patient flow, with 13min processing time for routine patient and 59min for procedure patient. however, the total non-value adding time is found to be 188min (3hr) for routine and 388min (6hr) for procedure patients. the patients waiting for the scan reports is found to be the major bottle neck. during the second phase of work: to develop arena model initially best fit distribution is done on the obtained data. arena simulation model is developed for the radiology department to analyze the number of patients out, waiting time per patient and average number of patients in the system. the model is verified by a specialist and validated using t-test, the model is replicated 200 times in arena to give best results with minimum deviation. total 6 scenarios are analyzed to determine the impact on the above mentioned kpis. simulation results of current scenario showed 567 patients out of the system, with a maximum wait time of 31min/patient and average 43 patients in the system. the simulation results of the 5th scenario provided the optimum output, with 30% improvement in patient out, 3% reduction in waiting time per patient and only 19 patients in the system on average. based on it a future vsm is created which provided a 26% and 19% decrease in processing time, while non value added time is reduced by 73% and 61% for routine and procedure patients. this can lead to increase in the number of patients to be entertained by the radiology services without adding any new resource. 357",,,"with arena simulation in public health care services: a case of the radiology department. sana hassan & asim amjad lecturer at department of industrial engineering and management faculty of quality and industrial systems engineering, university of the punjab pakistan. sana.iqtm@pu.edu.pk & asim.iqtm@pu.edu.pk saher afshan student at department of industrial engineering and management faculty of quality and industrial systems engineering, university of the punjab pakistan. saherafshan0@gmail.com iqra ramzan lecturer at school of engineering university of management and technology lahore iqra.ramzan@umt.edu.pk",
49,Tilalook: A Pls-Sem Study For An Agile-Based Online  Platform For Frozen Processed Chicken Meat Supply Chain,"this research paper aims to create an integrated online platform that can address the issues faced by members of the supply chain of frozen processed chicken products in the philippines during the covid-19 pandemic. these groups are namely the customers, retailers, and producers/suppliers of the mentioned product. as a mixed-methods study consisting of a quantitative and qualitative aspect, two modes of data gathering were executed. a survey questionnaire was given to the group classified as the customers. for the retailer and producer/supplier group, a semi-structured interview was conducted. the respondents were from region iv-a and ncr. the researchers first identified the significant factors as well as the direct and indirect relationships existing between the latent variables covid-19 challenges, market opportunities, and supply chain effectiveness based on the survey responses. this was carried out using partial least squares and bootstrapping in structural equation modeling (sem) with the help of smart pls 3. a formative measurement model was also constructed. according to the results, closure of markets, inter-city/municipality transportation restrictions, labor shortage, and purchases from home all significantly affect and directly contribute to the latent variable covid-19 challenges (c19c) - signifying their contribution to the difficulties in the pandemic supply chain of frozen processed chicken products. for market opportunities (mo) and supply chain effectiveness (sce), it was observed that price increases, purchasing frequency, and on-site purchase were directly related to mo while quality of online ordered. products, courier availability, sufficient number of drivers, and price differences of delivery services were all directly related to sce. indirect observed constructs were referred to as relatively important factors. as for the creation of the agile online supply chain platform, the researchers utilized content analysis for the qualitative aspect. existing literature was used to further back up the features and functions to be included in the agile integrated platform for customers, retailers, and suppliers. the following are the topmost features that were prioritized as part of the design of the product based on the responses: product transparency, shared information on real-demand, order visibility, and fast communication.","covid-19 challenges, bootstrapping",,"abdullah galo, gwyneth panganiban, venusmar quevedo and sheila mae carungay department of industrial engineering college of engineering adamson university, manila, philippines jr.galoabdullah@gmail.com, gwynethkatecastillop@gmail.com, venusmar.quevedo@adamson.edu.ph, sheila.mae.carungay@adamson.edu.ph",
50,Implementation Of Improvement Measures For The Refusal  % Reduction In Distribution Centers Of A Peruvian Brewing,"the order’s delivery process of this peruvian brewery generates many rejected orders and, therefore, cost overruns, for which the present work aims to make an analysis of the main problems, such as product quality, truck loading errors and non-payment of clients; and propose improvement actions to reduce refusals, operating and transportation costs. in addition, the purpose of the research is to demonstrate the profitability of the proposed improvements, both establishing a prepaid service and implementing rfids for inventory control, based on the current situation of the company and its logistics network, and analyze how these improvements affect the main kpi refusal percentage. on the other hand, the methodology has followed the imrad structure, and tools such as input analyzer and the monte carlo method were utilized. the main findings of the research explain that the refusal % was reduced from 2.28% to 1.83%, and the benefit / cost of the proposed improvement actions has a value of 1.83, indicating that for every dollar invested, there is a benefit of 1.83 dollars. this proposal, shows that these actions are effective and feasible, maintaining the service level and reducing the costs previously mentioned.","refusal, logistics, improvement, rfid","and Future Research The company effectively has the capacity to reduce the refusals % due to non-payment by customers, loading errors and poor quality, which generates a better rate of orders delivered correctly and generates efficiencies in transportation and distribution centers. There is a total positive benefit-cost ratio of 1.83, so the proposals are viable and beneficial. The flexibility in policies must be aligned with the objectives and planning of the company. It is necessary to analyze the client portfolio and formulate strategies for the different segments to ensure profitability. Some differences with other investigations include the SKU numbers of the companies, since in this case there are not as many codes as in others. Also, some involve supply chains with ocean shipments of products. On the other hand, the investigations are assimilated to the studies of companies with high turnover products, especially in the warehouse areas, and because the sources of efficiency are focused on eliminating the waste of operating time, resources, and unnecessary transfers, which are converted into costs. The novelty of this research was the focus on a problem not so commonly analyzed, which represents refusals, which cause less customer service and money losses from various sources. The 3 specific reasons investigated, and the improvements not only fulfilled the main objective of reducing rejects, but also show a correlation with efficiency in distribution centers. Likewise, the Monte Carlo Method was used to foresee probabilistic cases that model reality. It is recommended to expand this research with analysis of physical operations and time studies in the different distribution centers to further reduce times, routes and further automate processes. Inefficiencies due to waste of time, products and operations were eliminated. For this reason, the implementation of lean manufacturing techniques, analysis of routes and increase of technology in DCs for other operations would surely generate lower costs. 368","company jose miguel cockburn and alvaro oyague department of engineering and architecture university of lima lima, peru 20170397@aloe.ulima.edu.pe, 20171119@aloe.ulima.edu.pe","References

53,Assessment Of A Train Station Facility In Relation To Its  Design Dimensions Affecting Passenger Experience,"the rail industry is starting to focus on the improvement of the overall experience of their passengers which is not just limited to the ride experience but also includes their experience while in the line's facilities such as their rail station. to improve passenger experience, improving the facility's design and configuration based on the quality dimensions and factors affecting it will be vital. this study aims to assess one of the busiest stations in the philippines, the taft station of the mrt-3 line along epifanio de los santos avenue based on its quality dimensions. the quality dimensions identified through literature include accessibility, navigation, and comfort & convenience. the passengers' perceived experience of the station's quality dimensions was assessed, rendering unsatisfactory results. gaps observed include the lack of standard and visible signage, information boards and markings, repair of equipment, physical obstructions on the walkway, and no proper infrastructure for persons with disabilities and the elderly. design alternatives were then generated to improve the current facility in the aspects concerning quality dimensions. the study recommends implementing the generated design alternatives to improve the passengers' experience in mrt-3 taft station. a similar assessment method can be used for other train stations as well.","rail, facility, design","One factor that affects the experience of passengers in their railway commute is their experience in and with the rail station facility. Hence, if passenger experience is aimed to be improved, a vital component of the improvements that should be done is with the facility. The Design Qualities of a railway station are factors that can be considered in improving the passenger experience. It includes accessibility, comfort, convenience, and ease of use among others. These are qualities that a rail station's facility must have to provide a positive customer experience. However, in the case of MRT-3 Taft Station, there are gaps and issues in terms of congestion, lack of facility features, and poor facility arrangement/maintenance which could negatively affect the experience of passengers. To address these, solution alternatives were developed. These alternatives aim to Improve Station's accessibility, navigation, and passenger flow, and provide comfort and convenience to passengers – that if all implemented well, will help contribute to the improvement of passenger experience and help with the achievement of the company's goals. For the areas of future study, other researchers may consider the impact of passenger volume in the station in determining the appropriate quality dimension features of the facility that will be improved. This should cover the study of the appropriate spatial and capacity requirements (ex: number of ticket booths, dedicated lanes for queueing, size of the platform, etc.) given the current and future passenger demand – which was not covered in this study. A similar assessment method can also be used for other train stations as well.","regine a. tejada and john robert d. asonza department of industrial engineering and operations research college of engineering university of the philippines diliman quezon city, philippines ratejada1@up.edu.ph, jdasonza@up.edu.ph",
54,Application Potentials And Knowledge Acquisition: Artificial  Intelligence In Industrial Companies' Controlling,"the benefits and application potentials of artificial intelligence in controlling are widely known. contrary to expectations, an in-depth interview study of austrian industrial companies shows that the use of ai in controlling is only just beginning. in order to make controllers fit in this area, in-depth knowledge channels are required. in addition, several other aspects need to be considered for implementation. this paper presents the results of a qualitative pilot study from austria on the use of artificial intelligence in the controlling departments of austrian industrial companies.","application, austria","The results of the survey show that the benefits of artificial intelligence in controlling are seen by industrial companies, but are not yet in use or only to a limited extent. Due to their operational activities, controllers usually do not have the time to deal intensively with AI technologies. In addition, there is often a lack of acceptance at employee level to deal with new topics such as computer skills in programming. At the organizational level, there is usually a lack of data quality and resources. In order to demonstrate the potential of AI, best practice examples or use cases are best suited, which show the facts, a solution, and ideally also the benefits such as time savings. In this respect, knowledge can be acquired through various information channels. Video instructions, ideally combined with demonstrations of use cases, are very frequently mentioned in this regard.","departments rudolf grünbichler researcher faculty of mechanical engineering and economic sciences graz university of technology graz, österreich rudolf.gruenbichler@tugraz.at alexander sitter and thomas fenzl departement of business management university of applied science villach, österreich a.sitter@fh-kaernten.at, t.fenzl@fh-kaernten.at",
55,"Design, Development, Prototyping, And Pilot-Testing Of  An Ergonomic Farmer’S Chair","farmers have a huge role in providing food security for any country. however, in some regions in the philippines where farming activities are still done manually, farmers experience muscle and bone stress and strain, leading to work-related musculoskeletal disorders. the initial ergonomic assessment for farmers that do manual farming indicated that the farmers have a “high” risk of injury due to long hours of squatting and sitting with a twisted upper body and neck. hence, this study involved designing and developing an ergonomic chair that would help farmers do their work more efficiently while reducing the risk of musculoskeletal disorders. a prototype of the ergonomic chair was constructed and pilot-tested with some farmers. reba was used to assess the risk level of farmers before and after using the prototype. paired t-test was used to determine significant changes in reba score before and after intervention. using the prototyped ergonomic farmer’s chair, the risk level for musculoskeletal disorders was significantly reduced from “high” to “medium.” aside from this, the farmers observed an improvement in the overall well-being of their bodies.","ergonomic chair, farming, reba","Farmers in Regions 1 and 3 suffer from body pain, particularly in their hip, shoulder, hand/wrist, legs, knees, thighs, neck, elbow, arm, waist, feet, head, and back when manually planting and harvesting crops. Furthermore, their Rapid Entire Body Assessment (REBA) scores fall into the high-risk level of injuries when doing their manual farming activities without the use of any chair. This indicates the need for an intervention and a change in a short period. The farmer's ergonomic chair design was based on the body measurements and movements of the farmers, specifically the seat height, backrest height adjustments, and overall chair dimensions. The chair's features were also based on the needs and environment of the farmers. The research team made three prototypes specifically designed for farmers. Prototype 3 is the final chair design and is the farming instrument that could help the farmers improve their awkward posture and reduce body pain when planting and harvesting crops. The use of ergonomic farming instruments like the designed ergonomic farmers' chair relatively reduced the risk of acquiring Work-related Musculoskeletal Disorders (WRMSDs). The intervention allowed a REBA score improvement from 9.7, which is at a high-risk level, down to 6.4, at a medium-risk level, indicating a lesser burden of 3.3 units. However, a medium risk level still needs further measurement and analysis. Thus, utilizing an ergonomic farming instrument can be an effective farming technique to reduce the risk of WRMSDs. A further improvement in the design could involve using the originally intended frame material of aluminum alloy to decrease the weight of the chair and increase the length of the seatbelt until shoulder level for more stability. Furthermore, correct sitting posture is just as important as correct posture while standing. Hence, farmers must consider ergonomics when performing farm work such as when planting or harvesting, whether they are seated or 395","geraldine g. nerona and michelle c. adiwang professor of industrial engineering school of engineering and architecture saint louis university baguio city, philippines 2600 ggnerona@slu.edu.ph, mcadiwang@slu.edu.ph maya kayne s. lagrana production planning analyst texas instruments philippines inc. baguio city 2600 jezel jade g. gumallaoi bs industrial engineering batch 2022 saint louis university baguio city, philippines 2600 czarina mae c. grospe bs industrial engineering batch 2022 saint louis university baguio city, philippines 2600","References

In this article, we examine how industrial manufacturing technologies have developed through time as well as the state of smart manufacturing today, which is a key component of Industry 4.0. We have also gone into detail about several smart manufacturing technologies and shown how AI technologies have an impact on the entire manufacturing process. Also, current issues are explored, which can give academics and practitioners ideas for future study directions. To eliminate the need for human labor and speed up production, manufacturers are choosing complete factory automation. AI-driven quality inspection solutions are also essential for enabling the highest caliber products to be sold. Moreover, innovative ideas like CPS, IIoT/IoT, additive manufacturing, and immersive technologies have had a big impact on improving manufacturing processes that use smart manufacturing systems. The majority of manufacturing sectors do not, however, use these technologies frequently, leaving a significant gap between the theoretical smart manufacturing system and the actual manufacturing system. This may be a result of the challenges and lack of understanding involved in integrating smart manufacturing technology, as well as the potential returns on those investments. Smart manufacturing can be difficult to adopt at first, but once it has been implemented, both businesses and end consumers can greatly benefit from it.","wm michael barnes '64 department of industrial & systems engineering texas a&m university college station, texas, usa arvinshadravan@tamu.edu , hamid.parsaei@tamu.edu",
63,An Approach To Six Sigma Project Selection And Team  Members’ Assignment,"six sigma methodology has proven itself to be effective tool for organizational performance improvement. critical to its success is the project selection and assigning suitable team members for project execution. though, this task appears to be quite simple and obvious, casual selection and imprudent assignment of team members to the carefully chosen projects may turn futile. in this work, we present a two-stage approach to carefully select six sigma projects (also called as critical to quality) and later, assign the best team members for the projects execution. in the first stage, we select the projects by mapping those with the organization’s vision and mission. here, we use the balanced scorecard approach and the classical eisenhower matrix. a balanced scorecard approach of evaluating the projects, provides management a valuable insight to their service requirements, and hence, provides clear image for quality/performance improvement. an eisenhower matrix also called as urgent-important matrix, helps decide and prioritize projects by its urgency and importance. this help shortlisting the projects to be delegated to the employee/s. in the next stage, we consider assigning of the team members to the shortlisted projects. here, the skill sets of the team members are mapped with those required for selected projects. an extension of gale-shapley algorithm is used for this purpose. gale-shapley algorithm, also called as stable-matching algorithm, helps in allocating the team-members to the selected projects according to their choices and to the best of the project’s requirements. here, we present an extension to the classical gale-shapley algorithm where more than one team members are assigned to a project. the entire approach is presented with an illustration. we hope that this work will not only help the six sigma practicing managers but also to executives, involved in shortlisting the key projects for their organization, and also formulating the best possible team given the availability of team members. key words: six sigma, project selection, balanced scorecard, team members’ assignment. biography: prof omkarprasad s vaidya holds a doctoral (fellow) degree from national institute of industrial engineering, mumbai. he completed his post graduation in mechanical (production) engineering. just before joining iim lucknow, he worked with iim raipur for nearly two years. he teaches service operations management and quality management and six sigma along with core operations subjects. he has published number of research papers various journals of international repute. 495 proceedings of the international conference on industrial engineering and operations management manila, philippines, march 7-9, 2023 © ieom society international",,,"omkarprasad s vaidya, professor, operations management, indian institute of management, lucknow, india osv@iiml.ac.in",

65,Third Party Logistics–Spd Model In Hospital Supply Chain  Kiattisak Lapmool,"the complexity of the hospital supply chain results in numerous unfavorable outcomes, including out-of-stock situations, excessive inventory levels, product expiration, and medical errors. spd, which refers to supply, processing, and distribution, has come to light as a solution for mitigating some complexities-related burdens. nevertheless, the spd is still immature and has limited applications. adopting supply chain management approaches successfully implemented in other industries with the desired outcomes to strengthen the spd’s capabilities is therefore promising for the hospital. this study’s objectives are to examine the third-party logistics (3pl) model functioning as spd and to enhance its performance by incorporating it with vendor-managed inventory (vmi) and inventory policies in managing the spd of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (capd) service. therefore, this research proposes four logistics models, including an spd with vmi (spd-vmi) and three spd-vmi models integrated with three different inventory policies, which include average inventory level and out-of-stock (oos), are analyzed using discrete event simulation (des). the results show that integrating the spd with vmi improves inventory levels and out-of-stock incidents. when three inventory models are implemented, the results indicate a comparable out-of-stock reduction for all three policies. additionally, the spd-vmi with an order-up-to policy has the best performance in minimizing inventory and out-of-stock occurrences.","spd, vmi, 3pl, capd","In this study, the effect of inventory policies that are applied to the SPD-VMI models is investigated to establish whether or not these policies will assist in improving the performance of the SPD. The average inventory level and the number of occurrences of “out-of-stock” (OOS) are both measured throughout the simulation for the purposes of this study. In light of the findings of the simulation, the following research question and conclusion are drawn. The combination of 3PL and VMI operations as an SPD (SPD-VMI model) results in improved performance in terms of lowering average inventory levels and reducing the number of instances of out-of-stock conditions. The SPD is able to effectively manage the PD fluid inventory thanks to real-time monitoring and stock replenishment that is based on the most current data.

68,Incentive Mechanism Of Blockchain Technology In Sharing  Economy,"due to the innovative business model and the digital platform's crucial role, the sharing economy appears to be a new entity in the business world. however, companies rake in by providing both parties with a common platform. this paper focuses on utilizing blockchain technology (bct) in the sharing economy. a theoretical model has been suggested that does away with the existing incentives system and permits transparency end to end. by fostering flexible networking architecture with openness and equality at its core, the sharing economy departs from the pre- existing economic system and focuses on ownership. while sharing has evolved from a collaborative practice to a viable business model, it goes far beyond blurring the line between paid employment and uncompensated volunteering. literature suggests that transportation and accommodation are the most promising domains of sharing economy. however, to ensure trust and transparency across the platform, bct can be used. the proposed model uses tokenization and gamification over the underlying proof-of-stake (pos) consensus mechanism to provide a real peer- to-peer network that challenges the current model. the nodes and validators earn tokens as a reward, while the gamification process allows the service to scale and get better incentives.","sharing economy, gamification, tokenization",,"souradeep koley, mukesh barua research scholar, indian institute of technology roorkee professor in department of management studies indian institute of technology roorkee uttarakhand, india s_koley@ms.iitr.ac.in, mukesh.barua@ms.iitr.ac.in",

72,Electromagnetic Performance Analysis Of Outer Halbach  Magnet Rotor Brushless Dc Motor 150Kw,"in this paper, an outer rotor electric bike brushless dc motor of 200 kw for electric vehicles is investigated with different magnet topologies. magnetic angle and halfbach arrangement are varied to evaluate their electromagnetic torque, forces, and temperature distribution. the power and torque density and efficiency performance have been also studied and compared with ipm motors with the same geometry and power drives. this study for applying an auto- design program is to find out suitable permanent magnetic parameters and winding size after iterations. this program allows us to estimate the magnetic flux density, electromagnetic torque, and ripple torque via a finite element magnetic method (femm). to reduce the cogging torque ripple and harmonic order of back emf, the magnet angle and halbach topology will be validated by the fem simulation. the simulated results are also compared with the measured results from the experimental test system.",brushless dc motor,"The results of power, torque, and efficiency performances obtained by the FEM are successfully checked to be close to the measured results. The BLDC motor has been also successfully manufactured and tested by the dynamic test bench. This is very difficult to test the dynamic performance of the full torque, current, and power for starting mode because of the mechanical coupling of the E-car and torque sensors. This design can be improved after doing the experimental test. For this application, the torque needs to be increased by 10% to improve the starting torque. 560",bui minh dinh school of electrical and electronics engineering hanoi university of science and technology dinh.buiminh@hust.edu.vn dinh hai linh vietnam forestry university hailinh.vfu@gmail.com,"References

While conventional motorcycle cost more on several points, such as total capital expenditure, energy cost, and produce carbon emissions. It can be concluded that electric motorcycle has better values on specification, energy consume, energy cost, carbon emission, purchase cost, and tax. But there are still room for improvement for the regulation and the production of electric motorcycle in Indonesia to compress the cost of capital expenditure or operational expenditure to accelerate the adoption of electric motorcycle in online-based transportation.","in indonesia eileen onggaria, fajar marhaendra, ilham nur pratama, olivia elisabeth manurung, arief nurdini and rahmat nurcahyo department of industrial engineering universitas indonesia,depok, indonesia eileen.onggaria@ui.ac.id, fajar.marhaendra@ui.ac.id, ilham.nur@ui.ac.id, olivia.elisabeth@ui.ac.id, arief.nurdini11@ui.ac.id, rahmat@eng.ui.ac.id",
75,An Evaluation Of Customer Satisfaction In Omnichannel  Logistics Service Quality By Revised Importance–,"since logistics service quality has become a key strategic weapon for omnichannel success in the business-to-customer (b2c) retail sector. therefore, it is essential that retailers have a deep understanding of customer satisfaction with the quality of logistics service and benchmark them with the best competitors. this study proposes a systematic framework to evaluate customer satisfaction with omnichannel logistics service quality (oclq) using revised importance– performance analysis (ipa) approach. one of an e-commerce retail companies in thailand is used as a case study. in this study, twenty logistics service attributes are identified throughout the customer’s shopping journey. the research survey is conducted using a sample size of 411 clients. revised ipa is applied to analyze the survey data, and then categorized the oclq in to 4 groups as “keep up the good work”, “possible overkill”, “low priority”, and “concentrate here”. the customer satisfaction benchmarking is performed with the best competitor of the case company. the findings of this study can help the case company enhance the customer satisfaction with oclq in order to maintain a competitive advantage.",service quality,"that A1 Information Quality is the most significant factor from direct customer questions, while customer satisfaction and OCS have implied significance. It has been determined that A2 Information Availability is the most crucial factor. Even if there are various factors in the findings, however, if you consider them in terms of channels These two elements play a part in the pre-purchase funnel and are factors that have to do with product information; it denotes how important the information is to the customers. The benefits provided by the search funnel are more important to consumers than the costs realized when searching for the funnel. This is in line with the study by Verhoef et al. (2007) which found that the pre-purchase funnel was highly important, especially in the field of information when customers use the Internet to find the best products. Singh and Jang (2020) discussed the importance of the pre-purchase funnel as it made customers aware of the benefits to be received and the cost of expenses. Therefore, the service quality of this channel is the most important channel. From Figure 3. Implicitly derived importance – Performance Analysis Matrix, it shows that there are 3 attributes in Quadrant IV: A5 Shopping enjoyment from pre-purchase channels, A7 Purchase convenience, and A8 Service quality of employees/automation from the purchase channel while compared to the best competitor. According to Figure 5. Implicitly derived importance – Performance ratio Analysis Matrix, it can be seen that three attributes, also in quadrant IV, are defined as "" Concentrate here "" A5 Shopping enjoyment, A6 Compare the prices from the pre-purchase channel, and A8 Service quality of employees/automation from the purchase channel. When comparing the results from the two matrices, it shows that the factors A5 Shopping enjoyment and A8 Service quality of employees/automation from the purchase channel are two factors in Quadrant IV, defined as "" Concentrate here "". Hence, the case study company should prioritize improving these two attributes in order to increase customer satisfaction and increase competitiveness. While in Quadrant I ""Keep up the good work"", there are duplicates of the two matrices, A1 Information Quality and A2 Information Availability from the pre-purchase channel and A12 Purchase Effort from the purchase channel. These three factors are the factors that customers expect and pay attention to. The performance of these factors of the case study company meets the expectations of customers. These three factors are key strengths for companies to maintain their service quality levels in order to maintain competitive advantage. As for the purchase channel, these two factors in Quadrant IV are defined as "" Concentrate here "". Therefore, the case study company should prioritize improving these two attributes in order to increase customer satisfaction and increase competitiveness.

By 2025, the Indonesian government hopes to create 20% electrified motorcycles. This study compares the life cycle costs (LCC) and life cycle impacts (LCIA), especially of the carbon impact of conventional and electric motorcycles for daily use. Average distances for people with low, medium, and high mobility were 19.96 km, 54.55 km, and 95.43 km. Most commuters travel five days a week, with traveling to work being their main activity. In this study, data from two conventional motorcycle brands and one electric motorcycle brand were used. The lowest LCC in all condition during the first two years of ownership is the electric motorcycle X, while the conventional motorcycle B typically ranks highest. In a low, medium, and high mobility scenarios, electric motorcycles are more environmentally beneficial than conventional motorcycles. Since they use energy at the same rate, single and double batteries have the same GWP. According to the findings of this study, using an electric motorcycle X is recommended for low LCC and carbon impact concerns. An electric motorcycle's most expensive maintenance cost is replacing the battery, which significantly increases the LCC. The following study can provide a comparison between LCC and a battery rental system. There are some limitations to this study.

83,"Construction Material Waste Causes And Their Contribution  Levels: A Case Study Of Construction Projects In Abuja,","with a population of 211 million, nigeria's construction industry generates about 3 million tons of c&d waste per year. recovering, recycling, or reusing over 75% of c&d waste is possible. it's widely accepted that waste management methods, technologies, rating systems, and policies must be comprehensive and integrated. prevention, minimization, reuse, recycling, energy recovery, and disposal are waste management steps. recycling is unplanned in nigeria. this study analyses construction project mwg and predetermined materials waste causes. abuja construction professionals comprise the study. the targeted population was surveyed using convenience sampling and analyzed using frequency, mean score, and mann–whitney u test. the study confirms nigeria's construction waste causes. ""adjustments done without following the agreed-upon blueprints,"" ""revisions and alterations to the design,"" and ""spent resources on inefficient forms"" are the main causes of construction material waste on abuja building sites. it also shows that these factors affect mwg at different levels on nigerian construction projects. poor supervision is the most responsible for material waste generation, while inappropriate tools are the least responsible. to optimize building projects in abuja, nigeria, construction industry players should consider all investigated variables at each stage of their construction processes and waste management strategies.",waste management,". In addition, the variables that were included for the research were derived from the direct participation of these two groups in the building process. Therefore, the dependability of the results is demonstrated by the fact that they agreed on how to rate the many elements that were stated. The same phenomena is shown in this research as well as in other studies that are similar in nature, where rework that is not in accordance with the specifications appears to be a major component contributing to the formation of material waste. The findings of this study are beneficial to all parties involved in the building industry in terms of their costs, waste management, and control approaches. 6 Conclusion This study's objective was to determine the elements that contribute to the development of waste from construction materials on building sites in Abuja, which is the capital city of Nigeria. Based on the findings of the research, it was determined that "" Alterations made without following the agreed-upon blueprints,"" "" Revisions and alterations to the design,"" and "" Spent resources on inefficient forms "" are, in order, the three most important factors that contribute to the generation of construction material waste on building sites in the Abuja, Nigeria. It was also determined that all of the elements investigated in this study were seen as relevant by consultants and contractors as being involved in the generation of waste on site. The findings suggest that building sites in Abuja, Nigeria, make effective use of the construction equipment that is available to them. Moreover, it was found that consultants and contractors do not have vastly divergent perceptions of the causes of waste generation on construction sites, and that contractors have few difficulties acquiring work permits in Nigeria's capital city. This study advises that construction industry stakeholders take into account all the researched aspects at each stage of their construction processes and waste management plans to effectively optimize the performance of building projects in Abuja, Nigeria.","nigeria. chukwumaobi ndukwe ibe social and economic research institute department of natural and built environment sheffield hallam university sheffield, england c.ibe@shu.ac.uk",
84,Capabilities Management For Project-Based Organizations:  An Ontological Model Proposal,"in project-based organizations (pbos), projects, programs and portfolios are developed by professionals with different profiles and capabilities. these capabilities are composed of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques for management, such as influencing, motivating, listening and enabling. properly allocating these capabilities in projects allows for achieving objectives, removing obstacles, better decision-making, increasing productivity and team focusing. in a complex project environment, for instance, megaprojects, understanding and managing these capabilities could be difficult. this research proposes a tool for managing individual project management capabilities and facilitating their availability and correct allocation. this tool is developed through ontologies which are high- abstraction models composed of classes and relations and computer-processable. ipma individual competence baseline for project management is a reference framework for capabilities extraction, description, standardization and mapping.",ontologies,"The IPMA ICB4 framework was modelled as an ontology in this paper. The analysis of the obtained model shows consistency in terms of the domain modelled (in this case, the guideline selected). The model is composed of 650 classes, which may mean a challenge in terms of how to apply all these concepts in a project and for each individual. The availability of this ontology – and the automatic possibilities of analysis using it – represents a building block to digitalize the allocation process of these competencies. However, a set of activities can be developed to improve this model as a future study. First, a language evaluation may be developed to verify the correct ontology language usage (OWL) usage. For this purpose, the OOPS! Ontology scanner is proposed (Poveda-Villalón et al. 2014). A second activity relates to creating the individuals and their properties in the ontology for assigning competencies. This development may be addressed through a case study and based on a real project environment. Finally, the developed ontology is publicly available for use and improvement and it is hoped that this work will promote the adoption of digital tools to facilitate project management.

85,Enterprise Architecture Modelling For Pbo: A Case Study  Edison Atencio And Mauro Mancini,"the project management (pm) practices that characterize project-based organizations (pbos) are part of their core business processes. moreover, some pbos obtain their incomings by developing and delivering projects, such as construction companies. pbo's design and analysis have been developed from an organizational design perspective applying several frameworks such as galbraiths' star model or mckinseys' 7s. for the same purpose, the systems thinking approach is also a suitable alternative for managing organizational complexity and computer-assisted business design and analysis. within this perspective, the enterprise architecture (ea) managing tool has been widely applied in the information systems industry and, over time, has extended to other industries. ea is a group of principles, methods and models for designing and analyzing the enterprises' organizational structure, business processes, information systems and infrastructure. the use of ea as a management tool has the advantage of graphically showing the interrelationships between different components of an organization. systems thinking has positioned itself as a suitable perspective for organizing pm knowledge, as shown in the last version of pmbok (seventh). following this trend, this research develops an ea model of a pbo and shows how the ea components can represent the specific pm artefacts displayed in a pbo. the obtained model and its completeness is evaluated using the star model framework. this work is expected to encourage analysts and project managers to opt for ea as a management and governance tool for their projects and the organizations that host them.",project management,,"department of management, economics and industrial engineering politecnico di milano via lambruschini 4b, bovisa, 20156 milan, italy edisonpatricio.atencio@polimi.it, mauro.mancini@polimi.it edison atencio and guillermo bustos department of industrial engineering pontificia universidad católica de valparaíso av. brasil 2241, 2340000, valparaíso, chile edison.atencio@pucv.cl, guillermo.bustos@pucv.cl edison atencio department of civil engineering pontificia universidad católica de valparaíso av. brasil 2147, 2340000, valparaíso, chile edison.atencio@pucv.cl","references could become laborious and 
perhaps difficult to perform. For this reason, automatic tools for model analysis may be useful. Future studies could 
use ontologies as an alternative, where both the EA of the business, as well as the knowledge domains of Project 
management (PMBOK 7, for example) and organizational design models (Star Model) could be generalized in an 
ontology to then perform an ontology merging to replicate the same analysis developed in this work. 
Regarding the Star Model, it can be verified in this work that all its components (strategy, structure, processes, 
behaviour and people) are present in EA, so preliminarily, it can be mentioned that EA can support the design of a 
PBO in its models. However, this work is limited to verify the relationship with the component at a general level but 
does not go deeper at a higher granularity. Similarly, this limitation is replicated for comparing the EA model with 
PMBOK7. Therefore, the suggested future study on ontology could be extended to a complex business model and to 
the general domain of EA, Project management and PBO design frameworks, such as the Star Model, and verify their 
interrelationships.

86,Electromagnetic Torque Profile Improvement Of An  Interior Permanent Magnet Motor By Vv Magnet,"this paper has compared double v-shape and delta-shape rotor topologies by different optimal magnet angles. the power and torque are improved by changing the thickness of the outer bridge, and magnetic width. various metamodels were generated for each of the multi-objective functions and constraints, and the metamodels with the best prediction performance were selected. by applying a multi-objective genetic algorithm, several optimal solutions were compared to those of the initial model. the proposed multi-objective optimization method can guide the design of ipms for electric vehicles with high reliability and maximum torque. this program allows estimating electromagnetic torque, and ripple torque by analytical matlab program coupling to finite element magnetic method (femm) and ga optimization. finally, rotor lamination was stamped and assembled in the motor for the back emf test and no-load test. in order to evaluate the electromagnetic characteristic, a 2d fem program has been implemented to compare with a commercial ipm motor from roewe marvel x awd.","slot depth, air gap","An effective analytical model is developed and verified with a prototype. To optimize the design process of the motor in a very short period and without any need of FEM an intelligent optimization algorithm is fully implemented and described. The result of optimization shows the efficiency of the entire approach. The analytical model and the optimization program are both implemented using MATLAB which makes it easier to use. To validate if the suggested motor truly meets the requirements and boundaries, results are verified using FEM which is also controlled via MATLAB and will be initiated automatically after optimization. The entire package is a very powerful tool for the optimized design of a permanent magnet synchronous motor. This paper has investigated and compared the performances of IPM with VV and delta in wide range speed for EV applications. A significant contribution of this study is an analytical calculation of VV magnet angle for improving electromagnetic torque. The simulation results can achieve the peak torque and 150 kW and 300 N.m at base speed of 5500 rpm for the VV model design.

93,Fine-Grained Sentiment Analysis Of   Covid-19 Quarantine Hotels Through Text Mining,"the covid-19 pandemic compelled countries to conduct mandatory quarantine for incoming travelers. due to shortages in government facilities, hotels have become alternative quarantine sites. the quarantine procedures adopted by hotels have overlooked the guests’ comfort and well-being. the objective of this study is to discover critical quarantine service attributes and understand quarantined guest sentiments. fine-grained sentiment analysis was conducted by tokenizing and analyzing each word in each review sentence to categorize the hotel service attributes and detect the valence of guests’ sentiments. a database was formed using extracted data from english and chinese textual reviews from tripadvisor and trip.com on 23 designated quarantine sites in the hong kong region. a total of 14,023 english review sentences and 17,226 chinese review sentences were extracted from the period of december 2019 to november 2022. natural languages processes (nlp) such as vader sentiment analysis, latent dirichlet allocation (lda), and skip-grams were utilized to categorize the quarantine service attributes and gather key sentiments and insights. a comparative analysis of quarantine hotels and general hotels was conducted using the jaccard similarity index and results showed an overall similarity of only 15.79%. managerial implications were suggested to improve quarantine services in the hotel industry. it is found that chinese reviews emphasized staff, service, and facilities. while english reviews emphasized the overall quarantine stay, food, and check-in procedures. negative review sentiments confirmed the disregard for guests’ mental health while positive sentiments emphasized the importance of guest-staff interaction. the direct online interaction with staff through an app and conducting online group activities reflected high positive sentiment valence. applying insights from this study to existing hotel service procedures may deem useful should another crisis hit the hospitality industry.","text mining, sentiment analysis",,"raphael gonda department of business administration changwon national university changwon-si, gyeongnam, 51140, south korea 20227511@gs.cwnu.ac.kr jaehun park associate professor department of business administration changwon national university changwon-si, gyeongnam, 51140, south korea pjh3479@changwon.ac.kr",
94,Optimal Buffers Allocation In An Inter-Facility Material  Transfer System Modelled As A Closed Queueing Network,"queueing is a common phenomenon in manufacturing and service environments. practitioners often use queueing network models to analyse these systems for decision-making processes. however, finite queueing systems with blocking are used to a lesser extent due to the complexity of solving the systems. generally, closed queueing networks (cqn) with finite capacities do not lend themselves to product-form solutions and must be solved using approximation algorithms. this study considers the problem of determining the optimal buffers allocation for an inter-facility material transportation system in a manufacturing facility considering the blocking after service (bas) phenomenon. under bas, a job can only reach the next node until there is space available in the queue of the next node. if the queue capacity of the destination node is full, the job in the preceding node, even after being serviced, will block that server. in a typical material flow, trucks transfer materials between the facility and undergo several sub-processes such as gate entry, weighing, loading, and unloading. this material flow process is modelled using a cqn, and each sub-process is designed as a node with a finite queueing capacity. an analytical model is developed within this context to determine the optimal buffer sizes to maximise the system's throughput. more specifically, a simulation model is developed using the anylogic software, and the optimisation problem is incorporated into the model to determine the optimal buffer allocations. the anylogic simulation-optimisation experiment engine uses various metaheuristics through the optquest tool to determine the non-dominated solutions of the corresponding cqn. 705",,"This study considers the problem of determining the optimal buffers allocation for an inter-facility material transportation system in a manufacturing facility considering the blocking after-service (BAS) phenomenon. The buffer allocation problem constitutes a pivotal aspect in the design of material transfer operations, as it directly influences the system's overall efficiency and performance. The buffer allocation problem for a finite CQN is a complex and challenging task that requires careful consideration of various factors, such as the service rate, arrival rate, and network structure. The results of this analysis demonstrate the importance of considering buffer allocation in the design and optimisation of queueing networks. By answering the identified research questions, this study contributes to the existing literature on queueing systems by providing insights into how practitioners and researchers can allocate buffers more efficiently in CQN frameworks. The findings of this study have significant implications for various industries, including manufacturing and service sectors, where efficient management of queueing systems is critical for overall system performance. The results of this study show that organisations can make informed decisions about allocating resources, such as buffer sizes, that will lead to improved performance and reduced costs. Furthermore, utilising a robust tool such as finite CQN models for modelling inter-facility material transfer operations proves substantial value to decision-making at various managerial levels. The study has also showcased the advantages and effectiveness of integrating simulation optimisation techniques in addressing complex buffer allocation problems.

96,Torque Performance Analysis Of Bldc Motor For Electric  Motorcycle By Halbach And Skewing Rotor,"a permanent magnet bldc motor has been designed with different rotor configurations based on the arrangement of the permanent magnets such as step skewing halbach continuous ring/sinusoidal array. rotor magnet arrangement configuration strongly influences the torque and efficiency performance of permanent magnet electric motors. this paper is to compare and evaluate different rotor configurations for pm bldc motors with parallel/radial and halbach continuous ring/sinusoidal array permanent magnets. many applications for electric drives or electric aircraft prefer surface-mounted permanent magnet design due to its ease of construction and maintenance. a finite element method has been used for the analysis and comparison of different geometry parameters and rotor magnet configurations to improve efficiency and torque performance. this paper describes a comprehensive design of a three-phase pmbldc motor with 15 kw for an in-wheel electrical drive. an fea simulation of the pmbldc motor has been implemented to evaluate their designs. in this paper, the step-skewing and halbach magnet array are applied to the pm surface- mounted brushless dc motor for eliminating torque ripples. to observe the skewing rotor effect, the rotor slayers are skewed with different angles and a halbach sinusoidal/continuous ring array. with a determined skewing angle, the cogging torque is eliminated theoretically, and back emf harmonics are also analyzed. after several design validation, a suitable design will be selected for pilot manufacture.","ansys maxwell, speed software","The paper has presented a comprehensive design of a PMBLDC motor for electric vehicles. The design was calculated by the analytical method. Four topology designs have been evaluated for electromagnetic characteristics by FEM. Particularly, radial and Halbachmanent magnet array rotors with skewed slides were carried out to compare efficiency, torque, and cogging torque. The torque ripple is minimum with a skew angle of 5.6%. The best Halbach continuous skewing magnet array is determined by a 5-slices angle of 10 degrees. For electrical drive, the PM surface-mounted motor is easy to arrange Halbach and skewing structures. A thermal analysis of a PMBLDC motor has been performed successfully by approach method based on analytical and FEM simulation under full-load steady-state conditions.

97,Assessment Of The Prevalence Of Symptoms Of Vibrationrelated Illnesses Among Agricultural Machine Operators In,"studies have shown that filipino agricultural operators are exposed to vibrations greater than the daily exposure limit values, which puts risks to the operators. additionally, there have been various studies abroad on the effects of vibration on the human body. with that, this study investigated the whole-body musculoskeletal disorder (msd) symptoms experienced, the mean onset and severity of symptoms, the existence of vibration-related illness specifically hand-arm vibration syndrome (havs), and analyzed the physiological effects of vibration and effects on functions of the hands and wrist to 100 filipino farm operators from tarlac and laguna through a small group discussion. the study utilized the following questionnaires: extended nordic musculoskeletal disorder questionnaire to measure the prevalence of whole-body msd symptoms, average years before the onset and severity of symptoms; the cold intolerance symptom severity questionnaire to analyze cold intolerance as the basis for the existence of havs; and lastly the boston carpal tunnel syndrome questionnaire to examine the physiological symptoms in the hands and wrist and the effects of vibration to the hand functions. responses were collected and analyzed, which revealed that whole-body msd symptoms are prevalent in all the covered body parts with a minimum prevalence of 12% in the elbows, a maximum prevalence of 38% in the lower back, and the earliest onset of msd symptoms in the shoulders after a mean of 9.04 years of operating agricultural machines. results further revealed that 13% of the participants have mild and severe cases of cold intolerance and that operators experience the physiological effects of vibration to hands and wrist which also manifested in the occurrence of diminished hand functions. the result of the study can be a basis for creating policies to reduce the hazards of agricultural machines to the operators.","philippines, march 7-9",,"the philippines princess mercado , uplb industrial engineering department, plmercado@up.edu.ph",
98,A Genetic Algorithm Approach For Waste Collection Using  Multi-Trip Multi-Period Capacitated Vehicle Routing,"waste collection and transportation processes are accounted for more than 50% of all total waste management costs then there is an urgency for a waste recycling company to minimize this activities-related total cost by any means. route optimization in collecting those plastics wastes can be a good solution to addressing the problem. this research focuses on determining waste collection routes for multilayer plastic with the objective function of minimizing total transportation costs. the waste collection problem is modeled as vehicle routing problem (vrp) with a certain capacity and constrained time windows but here the vehicle is allowed to travel multiple times, this model said as the multi-trip multi-period capacitated vehicle routing problem with time windows (mcvrptw). the model was solved by an exact method using mixed integer linear programming and a metaheuristic approach using the genetic algorithm (ga). the results showed that the exact method was able to solve problems on small data instances and required almost 100% higher computation time than of metaheuristic approach. the best ga solution with mutation and crossover rates of 0.75 and 0.1 provides savings of 30.2% compared to the total transportation cost for existing conditions.","genetic algorithm, mcvrptw, route optimization","Finding the optimal route for collecting MLP on the MCVRPTW model using the exact method is considered inefficient in terms of computation time. Determining the route on an instance of 15 points takes up to 10 hours of computing time but has not yet obtained a global optimal. The application of the Genetic Algorithms (GA) method in finding the optimal route for collecting MLP on the MCVRPTW model has a computation time of 44 seconds. The best parameters selected for GA to obtain the optimal solution are 100 population, 100 iterations, 0.75 crossover rate, and 0.1 mutation rate. The optimal route based on GA has obtained 8 routes where 4 routes are served in period 1, 3 routes are served in period 2, and 1 route is served in period 3 with an objective function of IDR 277.710. The optimal solution generates savings of 30.3% compared to the existing conditions. This research has limitations so there are some suggestions for future research. The first suggestion is to consider other cost components in the formula of total transportation costs that have not been considered in this research. The second suggestion is might be considered for adding a new objective function such as minimizing the cost of carbon emissions.","problem with time windows (mcvrptw) nur layli rachmawati*, yelita anggiane iskandar, dian permana putri, and mirna lusiani department of logistics engineering universitas pertamina south jakarta, dki jakarta, indonesia nl.rachmawati@universitaspertamina.ac.id*, yelita.ai@universitaspertamina.ac.id, 102418012@student.universitaspertamina.ac.id, and mirna.lusiani@universitaspertamina.ac.id",

101,Review On Sustainable Energy Implementation In  Indonesian Cement Industry,"energy, both renewable and non-renewable energy, are increasingly used in every sector of life. manufacturing sectors, especially, account for the largest share of annual industrial energy consumption by 81% in which it consumes two general types of energy source, fuel and nonfuel. cement industry is one of the industries that plays an important role in the construction process and requires a large amount of energy in its production process. the use in this process contributes to a different amount of carbon emission. furthermore, this increase in energy consumption is not in line with the availability of energy sources. therefore, the indonesian government ordered energy-efficient strategies to maintain sustainability. a review on the implementation from secondary data was conducted and analyzed. the review result shows even though strategies and policies are implemented by the companies, a reduction of energy consumption within the past 3 years from the cement industry in indonesia does not necessarily obtain a decrease of carbon emission.","energy consumption, carbon emission, sustainable energy","This research provides a review and insight of the implementation in the cement industry in Indonesia. Based on data collected and reviewed, it can be concluded that companies within the cement industry in Indonesia have already implemented strategies and policies to maintain the sustainability of energy. Their programs resulted in a decrease of energy consumption in the past 3 (three) years. But this reduction in energy consumption does not come with a reduction of carbon emission as per expected. An increase is shown within the past 3 years of the industry. The limitations of this research lies in the lack of data collected limited from the company’s sustainability report for the past 3 years. This limits the research on the bigger evaluation of energy consumption, carbon emission production, and strategy implementation in the industry. Further research is recommended to gather more detailed data on the review of energy sustainability in the cement industry in Indonesia.","djoko nurprawito, erwin suryadi maila, rahmat nurcahyo, rangga damar bagaskara, yoga satria, dan zahrina zihni industrial engineering department faculty of engineering, universitas indonesia depok, 16424, indonesia djoko.nurprawito@ui.ac.id ,erwin.suryadi@ui.ac.id, rahmat@eng.ui.ac.id, rangga.damar@ui.ac.id, yoga.satria12@ui.ac.id, zahrina.zihni@ui.ac.id",
102,Using Place-Based Outdoor Learning (Pbol) Teaching  Model In Promoting Students’ Conceptual Understanding Of,"ecological literacy provides unraveling a comprehensive understanding of environmental issues and problems. nevertheless, applying this understanding often requires more than essential experiential learning. this study highlights a crucial, however frequently neglected, need for ecological literacy that allows educators and consultants of the distinct disciplines of education to apply methodical knowledge when encountering environmental and behavioral difficulties. the mixed-method research primarily intended to investigate how to promote students’ conceptual understanding of ecological concepts using the place-based outdoor learning (pbol) teaching model. the findings showed that using place-based outdoor learning to understand ecological concepts is further effective than the classroom setting (csi) approach. the student's overall understanding of ecological concepts has significantly improved. thus, results are highly recommending that educators in different fields can develop environmentally friendly controlling processes and contribute effectively to integrative work groups dealing with environmental issues and problems; and pedagogy and curriculum development on the strengthening evidence of the benefits of pbol activities that influence students, including improved connection with the natural situated places; exploring how the pbol teaching model can increase explicit memory and retention of concepts, and how reinforcement between the affective and the cognitive influence help scaffold higher-order learning.","biodiversity, interactions","that the PBOL teaching model helps students to understand the Biodiversity and Interactions concepts better than the CSI approach. This analytical procedure was used to perform an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) on the post-test scores after teaching the concepts. Since the study used a Solomon-four-group design for the control groups for the pretest before teaching the concepts, it was assumed that there was no significant interaction between the covariate (pretest) and the factor (treatment: PBOL or CSI). The significance value for Treatment (PBOL or CSI) is more than 0.05, indicating it has no significant effect on the student's conceptual understanding of Biodiversity. The value of -3.323 for CSI indicates that, given two students with a similar conceptual understanding of Biodiversity before the treatment, one may expect that the conceptual understanding of Biodiversity after treatment among the CSI classes is 3.3 less than that of the PBOL classes. The significance value for Treatment (PBOL) is less than 0.05, indicating that it significantly affects the conceptual understanding of Interaction. The value of -4.366 for CSI indicates that, for two students with a similar conceptual understanding of Interaction before the treatment, one can expect the conceptual understanding of Interaction after treatment among the students in the CSI classes to be 4.4 less than that of the PBL classes. Parameter estimates showed that based on the value of -12.356 for CSI, two students with a similar conceptual understanding of Biodiversity and Interactions before the treatment, one can expect the conceptual understanding of Biodiversity and Biodiversity after treatment among the students in the CSI classes to be 12.4 less than that of the PBOL classes. ""Do the study group, collaboration learning, and investigation impact on conceptual understanding?"" and ""Do the control group, self-directed learning, and deep questioning impact on conceptual understanding?"" are the third and fourth research questions of this study. Classroom observations revealed that students in the PBL classes collaborated, investigated, and showed retention more than those in the CSI classes. Students' collaboration and retention were higher than collaboration among the students taught using the PBOL model than those in the CSI approach. Specific qualitative observations on the students in the study groups indicated that most of the students were engaged by 2593","ecological concepts joy c. chavez education program supervisor deped regional office v (bicol) rawis, legazpi city, philippines joy.chavez1@deped.gov.ph","References

The mosque usage frequency is one of the determining factors that determines how much electricity will be use in the mosque. We also learned that tools like Air Conditioner is one of the top contributors in mosque electricity consumption, where it happened because mosque always use all of their air conditioners to keep the temperature comfortable enough for the people in there There’s lot of electricity usage cause by unregulated use of electricity happening in the mosque such as fan, air conditioner, lamps, etc. To reduce the electricity consumption in a mosque, the mosque guardian need to create some sort of rules to use electronics in the mosque, that way the mosque can keep their electricity usage low and keep the mosque operational cost low.","a case study of mosque in indonesia ardhy lazuardy1, arsya nugraha p2, haikal rastinggi3, luthfi azmaiza4, rachmat nurcahyo5, rizal palapa6 department of industrial engineering university of indonesia salemba, indonesia ardhy.lazuardy@ui.ac.id1 arsya.nugraha11@ui.ac.id 2 haikal.rastinggi@ui.ac.id3 luthfi.azmaiza11@ui.ac.id 4 rahmat@eng.ui.ac.id5 rizal.palapa@ui.ac.id6",

108,Workload Balancing For Stability Test Using A Mixed  Integer Programming Model,"this research studies a monthly task assignment for staff and testing equipment of a stability testing process in a pharmaceutical company. a stability testing process begins with collecting drug to the system, preparing chemical, glassware and equipment, testing drugs on equipment and writing reports. there are three types of a stability test where each drug requires different type of stability test, and some drugs require multiple types. each testing process requires different types of testing equipment, which requires different set-up time and processing time. currently, task assignments are determined based upon division manager’s experience which leads to unbalanced workload. to solve this problem, a mixed integer linear programming model (milp) is proposed to find the optimal solution, which focuses on minimizing the difference between maximum and minimum workload of staff, overtime, and penalty cost of postponement. the result of this model shows that the unbalanced workload among staff is reduced. moreover, by test postponement, overtime does not occur.","task assignment, stability test","and Future Work In this paper, a monthly task assignment of a stability test is studied. The stability testing process of pharmaceutical products begins with collecting drug to the system, preparing chemical, glass and equipment, testing on machines and writing the report. The objective of this paper is to propose a monthly task assignment model to minimize the unbalanced workload, overtime working of staff and the total penalty cost due to test postponement. A mixed integer linear programming model is developed to solve the problem from a real setting. The optimal solution for assigning tasks can be obtained. Due to demand variation in each month, all tests cannot be performed in the required month. Test postponement can help reduce overtime and balance workload. We observe that lot splitting does not occur due to fixed processing time to operate tasks. In this paper, we combine the processing time of each drug required on each resource and develop a model to assign tasks to resources by considering resource capacity. To implement the solution, a sequence of tasks on each machine must be considered. Task scheduling should be studied in the future.","waritsara woraruthai department of industrial engineering chulalongkorn university bangkok, thailand waritsara.wor@gmail.com wipawee tharmmaphornphilas assoc.professor of industrial engineering department chulalongkorn university bangkok, thailand wipawee.t@chula.ac.th",
109,Total Cost Analysis Of Combustion And Electric Cars In  Indonesia,"the electrification of transportation has been identified as a necessary aspect of climate change mitigation in order to limit global temperatures to 1.5°c above pre-industrial levels and prevent potentially catastrophic effects on the environment (thorne & hughes 2019). with the electrified vehicles (evs) ventures being in the early stage, the cost- benefit analysis of the vehicles is key towards capturing the indonesian market. as consumers, however, pricing may not only be the costs they consider; they also consider the total cost of ownership (tco) of the cars they purchase. the tco model incorporated the manufacturer’s suggested retail price (msrp), tax, fuel cost, charging cost, maintenance cost, and residual value including depreciation. this study aims to compare the value of total cost of ownership of electric and conventional cars in indonesia related to the relevant switching cost between evs and icev. in this study it was concluded that the tco value in hev is smaller than bev and icev. so that hybrid vehicles will be the most efficient car to have when driving long distances","electric vehicles, emissions","We assess the total cost of ownership (TCO) of three different types of vehicles, namely ICEV (Mazda CX 5), HEV (Nissan Kicks), and BEV (Nissan Leaf) according to conditions prevailing in Indonesia over a period of 8 years. In the current situation in Indonesia, we find ICEV's TCO 7% higher than BEV and 15% higher than HEV. The biggest advantage that HEV has is that it costs 56.19% less cost of charging/fuel than ICEV. We found a price differential between fuel and electricity which shows that it is critical to keep the price differential at some level for BEVs to be highly competitive. The TCO of HEVs is lower than BEVs up to year 8 due to the low initial purchase price of HEVs. The tax cost component proves that BEV is 83.9% cheaper than ICEV. Tax waivers should extend to both new and used EVs to further increase their TCO advantage. In this combination it can be concluded that the total cost of ownership of HEV is still the lowest compared to BEV and ICEV. In other words, a hybrid vehicle will be the most efficient car to own for long distance driving. 815","amiral rasyid1, joshua2, muthia khadijah3, putri aysha qalbi4, and rahmat nurcahyo5 industrial engineering department faculty of engineering, universitas indonesia depok, indonesia 1amiral.rasyid@ui.ac.id, 2joshua11@ui.ac.id, 3muthia.khadijah@ui.ac.id, 4putri.aysha@ui.ac.id, 5rahmat@eng.ui.ac.id","References

110,Investing In Information Systems Security Under  Asymmetric Information Sharing,"when firms are in an information sharing alliance, the amount of information that the firms provide may vary due to multiple factors, such as size, technology investment capacity, and the information security environment for the firm. hence, in many cases even the well-intended firms are unable to share the same level of information as they receive from other firms. we refer to such a situation as asymmetric information sharing. given this setting, information sharing alliances are confronted with the challenges of maintaining a fair information sharing environment, which would ensure proportional returns for firms in the alliance. in the current practice, firms are typically charged a membership fee by information sharing and analysis centers for participating in information sharing activities. however, the application of a membership fee does not totally address the problems that may arise due to asymmetric information sharing. first, the level of membership fee being charged does not reflect the level of information provided or received by individual firms. second, no monetary compensation to firms that share more information is provided, which forms a barrier for continuous information sharing. lastly, the membership fees for isacs do not consider the willingness to pay attitudes of firms that may prefer to purchase information from other firms. in this study we aim to address these issues by seeking answers to the following research questions: (1) what fair price should a firm pay participating information sharing in asymmetric sharing environment? and, (2) how would the price of information vary under different pricing strategies and other influencing factors? to this end, we develop analytical expressions of a firm’s payoffs under an asymmetric information sharing environment. we also analyze the pricing of information as a function of a firm’s technology investment level, its information sharing level, and the marginal cost of information sharing.","information, pricing, analysis, system, . security",,"yueran zhuo, senay solak, yi zou, selcuk uluagac senay solak , university of massachusetts amherst,",
111,Analysis And Improvement Of Energy Consumption For  Indonesia Mosque,"indonesia as a muslim majority country makes the mosques plays big part of the society. activities other than prayer are also held in the mosques. therefore, the electrical energy consumption can be consumptive and inefficient if they are not properly managed. also with the tropical climate of indonesia where the humidity is high makes achieving thermal comfort more difficult for the air conditioner, it also makes the energy consumption much higher. in this particular research, we aimed to analyze the energy consumption in some mosques in indonesia and give a recommendation on how to reduce the electrical energy consumption. by managing the energy and conserving the energy to achieve efficiency in mosques.","energy management, energy efficiency","This paper presents an energy consumption analysis among mosques in Indonesia. Data on energy usage, active hours, and monthly electricity bills have been obtained from four mosque sample in certain places in Indonesia. The findings were evaluated to find equipment with highest electricity usage. From four mosques, equipment with highest energy usage is air conditioner, followed by lighting. To reduce electricity consumption, improvement can be done by controlling the usage hour of air conditioner according to visitor behavior and conduct automation for turning the air conditioner on and off.

112,The Use Of Collaborative Intervention To Reduce The  Depression And Anxiety Of Students With Learning,"this study presents the use of collaborative intervention to reduce the depression and anxiety of students with learning difficulties. specifically, it aims to find out what effective intervention could be proposed, and what factors could differentiate the status of the students’ depression and anxiety after the collaborative intervention has been conducted. the depression and anxiety were measured using the 25-item revised child anxiety and depression scale (rcad) short version. the quantitative method was used for the numerical facts gathered through the child’s self-assessment and parent observation rating reports. on the effectiveness of the conducted intervention, the quasi-experimental was used with the pre and post-test design. contextualized intervention lessons were made and conducted collaboratively by the teachers and parents with the support of the barangay health workers. results of the students’ self-assessments and parents’ observation ratings were found to be higher for both depression and anxiety before the conduct of the intervention and found to be lower after the intervention has been conducted. the gain revealed in the posttest has proved that the use of collaborative intervention has a significant impact on reducing the depression and anxiety of students with learning difficulties.","self-assessment, depression","The manifestation of depression and anxiety is common to learners at the secondary level, more so to those with learning difficulties. Schools should have a way of helping them and providing them at once with appropriate and effective interventions. Valid and reliable tools to assess the symptoms of depression and anxiety among students are necessary. A school’s harmonious working relationship with parents and the community is a good way of knowing what the students are going through in life and how they could work together to help them overcome their depression and anxiety. The gain revealed in the post-self-assessment of students and-parent observation ratings have proved that the use of collaborative intervention has a significant difference in reducing the depression and anxiety of students with learning difficulties. The participation of students in class discussions and social skills were also improved as reported by the teachers. In addition, interviews with the school heads, parents, and barangay health workers revealed an improvement in the working partnerships of the school, family, and community. They confirmed that they were able to establish good camaraderie and with that, they feel more comfortable working with one another. Parents likewise reported that their relationships with their children improved, and their family bonds become stronger after their engagement in this study. In conclusion, the objectives presented in this study are achieved. The proposed and conducted intervention is effective. Valid and reliable tools, appropriate intervention, systematic processes, and strong collaboration are the key factors for this undertaking. It is hoped that more students will be benefited from this study not only those with learning difficulties but all students in general. The Department of Education, along with the Department of Health and the Local Government Units should work together in providing necessary psychological support and services to schools. Necessary funds from the government should be allocated for this purpose. Institutions or offices should establish a caring and family-like working environment to promote mental wellness among workers and employees thus, creating an impact on the quality of services and wholesome dealings with the clientele. This mental health practice, in a way, would create a ripple effect in the community and the family where the adolescents belong. Further studies on reducing and managing depression and anxiety among other groups of students or individuals are encouraged.","difficulties jean r. baloloy public schools district supervisor schools division office of albay department of education, region 5, philippines jean.baloloy@deped.gov.ph rodel e. pancho education program supervisor schools division office of sorsogon province department of education, region 5, philippines rodel.pancho001@deped.gov.ph",
113,A Biomimetic Framework For Evaluating The Functional  Trait Diversity And Adaptive Capacity Of The Firm,"organizations suffer economic losses from operational disruptions (see rice and caniato 2003, chopra and sodhi, 2004 greising and johnsson 2007, essuman et al. 2020, haraguchi and lall 2015, pettit et al. 2013). thus, there is a pressing imperative to determine alternative modalities of enhancing the operational resilience of organizations that will allow firms to become “naturally” more tolerant to operational disruptions. in ecosystem research, functional diversity, functional redundancy, response diversity and adaptive capacity have been argued and proved to promote ecosystem stability, resilience and tolerance against natural and anthropogenic perturbations (see nystrom and folke, 2001; folke et al. 2002; mouillot et al. 2005; de bello et al. 2007; naeem 1998; galland et al. 2020; walker 1995; desjardins et al. 2015; elmqvist et al. 2003; baskett et al. 2014; leslie and mccabe. 2013; mori et al. 2013, etc.). owing to ecological thinking which supposes that organizational ecosystems function similarly as biological systems (mars et al. 2012), it is hypothesized that firms can similarly leverage on functional trait diversity to enhance their potential operational resilience. to substantiate such postulation, this paper presents a biomimetic framework for qualifying and quantifying the functional trait diversity and adaptive capacity of organizations for the purpose of drawing insights that may prove useful in fortifying a firm’s posture against operational disruption.",response diversity,,"manuel christian orias phd student, industrial engineering de la salle university manila, philippines manuel_orias@dlsu.edu.ph",

115,Analysis Of Driver Behavior Questionnaire Variables On  Driving Safety: Literature Review,"driving safety is the driver's top priority when traveling. this is often done by using a means of transportation, namely a car, meaning that cars often have accidents in traffic, especially on freeways. this study aims to identify what variables were used by previous researchers in measuring the relationship between variables related to driving safety on the freeway; this is very closely related to driver habits and can be examined using the driver behavior questionnaire (dbq). the preparation of each question in the questionnaire has followed the standard questions in the preparation of the dbq. this is what researchers hope to be able to do to analyze the variables needed for driving safety more quickly. the method used is a statistical analysis method that aims to provide an overview of the appropriate variables when researching driving safety cases. the results of the study show that there are 4 variables that are often used in research on driving behavior: aggressive violations, ordinary violations, errors, and deviations. these variables are often used in driving safety research.","driving safety, driving behavior","The conclusions obtained from the results of the research that has been carried out are in determining the variables contained in the DBQ obtained from several initial studies including: there are actions that are most often carried out by motorists, namely sounding the horn when disturbed by other road users, overtaking / overtaking other motorists from left lane, and realized that I don't really remember the path I just walked which was categorized as lapses, ordinary violations, and errors respectively. While the actions that were rarely performed were getting angry at other drivers and chasing the drivers to scold them and driving while drunk were categorized as Aggressive Violation and Error respectively. Another result is that the most common driving violations are ordinary violations or intentional violations. While the highest form of violation committed is exceeding the speed limit on the road, Based on correlation analysis, it was found that driving experience has a moderate correlation with driver behavior in the form of violators, while the number of accidents experienced by drivers has a low correlation with traffic violations by drivers. Differences in distance characteristics also affect the level of alertness when driving, while driver behavior has almost the same character. Shorter mileage sometimes creates a less alert effect, but the reality is that drivers with closer mileage are more alert than those with longer distances. The level of fatigue in driving can be one of the factors that can reduce the level of alertness. Longer distances with work that is done repeatedly can cause fatigue more quickly. Determining the factors and aspects that influence driver behavior in driving with DBQ based on research and information regarding the factors that influence risky driving behavior are as follows: a. Aggressive violations: have a relationship with aggressive interpersonal opinions. b. Ordinary violations: These violations do not have an aggressive purpose but are still intentionally committing opinion violations. c. Errors or mistakes are deviant behavior or mistakes made unintentionally. d. Lapses or deviations are a reflection of behavior related to memory problems and attention to opinions. In the calculations using the DBQ, it was found that the results showed that the driver's assessment of their driving skills was reflected in their driving behavior, namely deviant driving. Additional studies can be conducted using qualitative methods such as focus group interviews to gain greater insight into thinking and behavioral motivation. In practice, research findings can support the development of a targeted DBQ aimed at addressing factors contributing to accidents. Leveraging DBQ and other assessment tools can provide a proactive organizational method to investigate the types of behavior exhibited by drivers and identify specific behaviors associated with violations. Significantly, the use of these measures can help develop a DBQ suitable for professional drivers that 878","diana khairani sofyan1;a rahim matondang2; listiani nurul huda3;aulia ishak4 1,2,3,4 industrial engineering science doctoral study program, universitas sumatera utara, jl. almameter kampus usu medan 20155 email: dianakhairani@unimal.ac.id1;a.rahim@usu.ac.id2; listiani.usu@ac.id3; aulia.ishak@gmail.com4","References

Moreover, in crash severity analysis, accurate prediction models are necessary to classify crashes based on their severity. In this work, statistical and machine learning algorithms are used to build models that predict crash severity at four different levels such as PDO, minor injury, severe injury, and fatality. Four models were implemented: logistic regression, K-nearest neighbor, Decision Tree, Random Forests on crash dataset for the city of Riyadh covering four years 2012-2016. 13 independent variables were used in the four models. Each mode gives different results. The findings can be summarized in the following: 1- Based on statistical testing, we may deduce that accidents with significant injuries are the most common patterns of accident severity, and that most accidents with serious injuries occur on straight highways. Fires in vehicles are the greatest cause of fatalities and serious injuries. In exchange for a minimal impact of these factors on accidents resulting in mild injuries. 2- Although the logistic regression model had the lowest accuracy rate of the four models, the confusion matrix test revealed a high number of positive correct hypotheses, indicating that the model's forecast of the selected hypothesis was right. 3- K-nearest neighbor was the second lowest model in term of accuracy with 0.974.The test data recorded a relatively stable accuracy level from the fourth neighbor to the eighth neighbor, with a slight decrease at the fifth and sixth neighbors. 4- Both the decision tree and the random forest recorded the best accuracy of 0.976. Entropy and Gini measures were used to construct the decision trees. Using the significance scale, the type and timing of the incident ranked first. In conclusion, this research provides valuable insights into the application of machine learning algorithms in crash severity predictive models. The findings of this research demonstrate that the proposed models outperform traditional statistical methods and achieve high accuracy in predicting crash severity. Furthermore, this research provides a novel approach to predicting crash severity by incorporating multiple factors, including weather, road conditions, and vehicle type, into the prediction process. This makes the proposed models a valuable contribution to the field of road safety and offers a potential solution for reducing the number of fatal crashes on our roads.

Entire returned product stored at the Company X to undergo disassembly process. The mathematical function described the total cost of disassembly in Company X. From the aggregate planning calculation, Company X still having available source for returned product. More returned product can be disassembled in company X, hence company X should collect more returned product. In the future, capability of worker concentration should be consider in the aggregate planning calculation.","maulida boru butar butar department of industrial engineering gunadarma university depok, indonesia maulida_b@staff.gunadarma.ac.id mohamad yamin department of mechanical engineering gunadarma university depok, indonesia mohay@staff.gunadarma.ac.id",
119,Analysis Of Barriers Affecting Performance Of Port Logistics  In Industry 4.0,"port logistics is a complex process involving numerous interconnected activities. port logistics are inherently volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous (vuca). due to vuca, it is necessary to enhance port logistics performance in order to remain competitive on the market. recently, the digital revolution has facilitated process improvement across all industries. in the age of industry 4.0, this study also seeks to identify and analyze the barriers affecting the performance of port logistics. the research offers a novel strategy for developing an analytic hierarchical model for analyzing and ranking the barriers. reviewing existing literature and conducting semi-structured interviews with port managers during the field visit helped to identify barriers. further, fuzzy set theory (fst), stakeholders theory, and analytical hierarchy process were utilized in this study to rank the identified barriers. the framework categorizes the barriers as strategic, tactical, and operational. in addition, it assists managers in understanding the barriers, making informed decisions, and addressing the barriers that require immediate attention.","barriers, industry 4.0, port logistics","In the global supply chain, port logistics play an important role in the transfer of goods. In the era of the fourth industrial revolution, ports are confronted with a number of obstacles during its implementation, which hinders the overall performance of port logistics. In the era of Industry 4.0, the research develops a hierarchical framework for ranking the port logistics obstacles. The study consists of two phases. In the era of Industry 4.0, the first phase entails identifying the various port logistics barriers. By conducting a field visit in one of India's major container handling ports and analyzing the available literature, barriers were identified. A workshop was held to collect the opinions of multiple port logistics stakeholders and to finalize the port logistics obstacles. In the second phase, Fuzzy-AHP was used to rank the barriers. Findings aid decision-makers in determining which obstacles require immediate attention. In addition, it facilitates the classification of barriers into three distinct categories based on their decision-making properties. In future research, subfactors of the obstacles could be identified and investigated. It is possible to conduct a sensitivity analysis of port logistics obstacles in the era of Industry 4.0.","bishal dey sarkar symbiosis institute of operations management, nashik symbiosis international (deemed university), pune, india bishal.sarkar@siom.in vipulesh shardeo department of operations and analytics lal bahadur shastri institute of management delhi, india vipuleshshardeo@gmail.com",
120,Examining The Influence Of Interruptions In Online  Learning On Student'S Perceptions,"the presented research focuses on examining the influence of interruptions in online learning on student's perceptions and comprehension. we conducted an experiment with 45 participants. each participant watched one lecture that belonged to one of the two experimental groups, a lecture with interruptions or a lecture without interruptions. while watching the lecture, the eye movements of the participants were recorded using an eye tracking device. after watching the lecture, the participants were asked to answer two questionnaires, knowledge questionnaire and subjective questionnaire. we found that interruptions do harm the comprehension of the delivered material when they occur and moreover, they cause an ""after affects"", harming the comprehension of the studied material even at times they do not occur at all. in addition, we found that interruptions attract the student's attention when they occur and at the same time causing a feeling of aversion and a desire to avoid focusing on them. which may eventually cause negative subjective perceptions and to harm the understanding of the studied material. the world of online learning has developed a lot in 2020 and in fact the whole world has been forced to switch to online learning. therefore, this technology must be optimized and improved.","online learning, interruptions, comprehension, eye tracker","that interruptions during online learning have a negative effect on student’s attention. We can add to that that interruptions during online learning have a detrimental effect on the understanding of the course material. Another conclusion is related to the Zoom lecture setting. We can show that looking at the lecturer increases the understanding of the topic. 5.4 Validation The validation process to the analysis shown in the Results section included the following steps: examination of missing values and errors, preliminary descriptive and frequencies statistics, reliability analysis (Alpha Cronbach), as needed grouping of variables and recoding. 6. Conclusion In our study, we examined the way in which disturbances affect the students' subjective perceptions of learning and the understanding of the studied material. This research has theoretical and practical contributions. Theoretically, this research attempts to analyze new teaching setting with eye tracker device, and to join this data to the students’ understanding and satisfaction. This research also has developed measurements model that can be used in another similar research. It seems that the research in this field has only begun (Kedem-Yemini & Katz, 2021). Mishra et al., (2020) claim that the outbreak of the COVID-19 virus has led to a pedagogical shift to online learning that is gradually expected to replace the formal face-to-face learning system. Through a solid understanding of student's attitudes and the challenges they face in online learning, educational institutions will be able to develop different strategies to assist and optimize the learning system (Aguilera-Hermida 2020). One of the main negative aspects of online learning mentioned among students is the occurrence of interruptions during learning (Hussein et al. 2020). In addition, we can specify practical recommendations, supported by our research findings. We will present three main practical applications emerged to optimize online learning. The first conclusion is that interruptions during online learning have a detrimental effect on student’s attention. Zhang et al. (2020) claim that most students are not even aware that they are distracted during a lecture. Lecturers teaching online must ensure a physical environment free of distractions and interruptions. They should close the door of the room where they are giving the lecture, and make sure that there are no unnecessary noises (for example by closing windows or devices that make noises). It is better to sit in an environment where there are not many objects in the background (such as decorations), and if there is no such area, lectures can and should use a minimalist digital background that does not overload visually. If there was an unplanned interruption during the teaching, the utterances said must be repeated. 935","and comprehension adva epstein industrial and management department college of engineering (sce) sami shamoon ashdod, israel aadvaep20@gmail.com sagit kedem-yemini logistics department sapir academic college sderot, israel sagity@mail.sapir.ac.il adi katz industrial and management department sability, the usability center in sce you head of college of engineering (sce) sami shamoon israel ashdod, adis@sce.ac.il","References

The research explores the NELSAP-CU Rusumo project as a case study, with green Logistics Management practices as the independent variable and operational performance as the dependent variable. The research was led by three specific objectives: assessing the impact of green warehousing, determining the impact of green packing, and calculating the impact of green transportation methods on MNC operating performance in Rwanda. Green Warehouse Management (GWM) refers to a collection of activities that improve warehouse operations that protect the environment. Additionally, green logistics practices in supply chains may improve operational efficiency, promote cleaner production, and reduce environmental degradation. There is a need for firms, whether they are service or manufacturing to include green processes into their operations to cut costs and increase competitiveness. There is consequently a need for firms, whether they are service or manufacturing to include greening processes into their operations to cut operating costs and increase competitiveness. Not all organizations implement green logistics in warehousing, packaging, transportation, and distribution. Companies that do so do not completely embrace it due to the start-up expenses associated with establishing green logistics processes. Firms should consider green logistics as a potential benefit to maintain current and future success. The government must ensure that green logistics is followed and implemented in every organization by reinforcing existing environmental protection policies to all stakeholders. Researchers can conduct additional studies and research on various green logistics dimensions that affect operational success. This research assists managers in developing green logistics knowledge and abilities in addition to the existing knowledge and skills required to manage the company at all levels.","lakes subsidiary action program coordination unit rusumo construction project alexis uwamahoro university of rwanda(ur), college of business and economics (cbe), kigali –rwanda uwamalexis2000@gmail.com simon peter nadeem centre for supply chain improvement, university of derby, derby, de22 1gb, u.k. s.nadeem@derby.ac.uk noor ismail shale and elizabeth wachiuri jomo kenyatta university of agriculture and technology (jkuat), nairobi, kenya shalle60@hotmail.com,ewachiuri@jkuat.ac.ke",
123,Aggregate Production Planning With Organizational  Learning And Social Sustainability Considerations – Current,"enhancing industrial organizations’ responsiveness to market fluctuations is essential to survive current global supply chain challenges. better responsiveness can be attained through robust and real-time production planning, especially on the tactical level through aggregate production planning (app) activities. a key variable in app is workforce productivity enhancement. however, the dynamic nature of the workforce raises concerns about productivity improvement initiatives. to address this issue, the incorporation of organizational learning and social sustainability into app has received significant attention from megacorps looking to increase competitiveness. this literature review assesses the prevalence of workforce productivity and social sustainability considerations in the app problem. the review found that there is a limited number of studies that consider organizational learning in app, and more research is needed to address the resilience of organizational learning evaluation models. additionally, there is a lack of studies that focus on social sustainability measures in app. finally, it was observed that metaheuristic approaches are commonly used to solve complex app problems, with genetic algorithms, harmony search algorithms, and simulated annealing being the most frequently employed methods. more research is needed to explore the use of other metaheuristic approaches and to assess their effectiveness in solving app problems.",workforce,,"gaps and future opportunities mostafa tarek, ahmad e. elhabashy, hadi fors, and m. hamdy elwany production engineering department alexandria university alexandria 21544, egypt mostafa.tarek@alexu.edu.eg, ahmadelhabashy@alexu.edu.eg, hadifors@alexu.edu.eg, hamdy.elwany@alexu.edu.eg","References

124,Optimizing Inventory Control In A Microbiology  Laboratory To,"the measurement for quality in a clinical laboratory is to deliver reliable patient results within a specific time frame. to do so, it always needs sufficient stock levels. unfortunately, little attention is given to inventory management and a designated laboratory worker is assigned to do inventory management tasks. in order to optimize inventory management, principles should be implemented to plan for future demands, buffer for present stock shortage, eliminate obsolete stock and modernize the system to ease follow ups on orders and back orders for all relevant staff. an experimental approach was used where known principles and methods were applied to determine if the outcome would add value. interviews with staff, historical data, and observations in terms of time and money were statistically analyzed. it was concluded that all principles, including modifying safety stock were valuable in optimizing inventory management. the amount of safety stock to carry should be determined by the balance between cost and services needed. the principles should be extended to the entire inventory and real-time receiving should be investigated and implemented for added improvement","abc analysis, dmaic, optimization, inventory control","and Recommendations The correlation between receipt and issue as well as a decrease in days on hands in the last month of observations suggests that the implementation of forecasting and re-order point increase effective inventory management. FIFO is an effective quality control method for inventory management where perishable goods are concerned and it aids in general housekeeping by allowing one to store kits on top of each other and behind each other that results in more effective space utilization. Safety stock should be reduced, in order to be cost effective, but it would still save money with stock outs. Alternative suppliers for kit A and kit B are more feasible in times of supply shortage in comparison with keeping a high number of safety stock on hand. If the safety stock is calculated correctly, it is most of the time more cost effective to have safety stock on hand. Realtime automated issuing proofed to be very successful to assist with stock forecasting, as well as decrease time spend on tasks like stock counts and issue. It is recommended to explore the possibility of real- time receiving to free more time for the materials management officer as well as assisting with more efficient stock control. It would also further involve laboratory staff in inventory management tasks. Transparency in the inventory management system promote collaboration between staff and management for optimal control. As mentioned in the methodology, the study was only conducted with a limited amount of space and resources. It is recommended to include more stock items with the aim to have forecasting, re-order point and real-time issue for all inventory items where possible. Revised safety stock should be kept for all category A items, category B items and category C items should be allocated safety stock items on discretion of management and the materials management officer. The decision should be made according to the organization’s objective in terms of a balance between cost and service level. If alternative suppliers are sourced, preference should be given to green companies that use recycled products or agents that is environmentally friendly to conserve resources for sustainability. In order to see if the principles implemented are successful for preventing stock outs, a longer time of observation is recommended.","provide high quality patient results kemlall r. ramdass professor of industrial engineering department of industrial engineering university of south africa ,roodeport, south africa ramdakr@unisa.ac.za mulde van der wateren student of industrial engineering department of industrial engineering university of south africa, roodeport, south africa 33076472@mylife.unisa.ac.za bongumenzi t mncwango lecturer of industrial engineering department of industrial engineering durban university of technology, durban, south africa bongumenzim@dut.ac.za",
125,The Evaluation Of Station Workload Through The  Application Of Work-Study Principles:,"the study explores the application of lean six sigma in case study of finding recommendation to solve real time production problems to increase efficiency and utilization while looking into manufacturing wastes which have a direct implication on production output. the study considered real production problem and the information was gathered was based on the station workload (time study and process waste) looking an efficiency and utilization of production line. the optimization of production process was based on work-study principles like lean six sigma, kaizen, time study. data collection used is survey & direct observation in a form of a time study. based on lss application, it was discovered that the current production performance standard can be improved & utilization can be increased and more manufacturing wastes were generated. the outcomes show that in this balancing situation, the suggested framework performs better than earlier approaches. the findings would offer insightful recommendations for balancing the line and increasing utilization to enhance assembly lines.","production process, lean six sigma, time study","Robots can take the role of takeout stations 5 and 6, which will help us reduce MV as well as errors related to weariness and carelessness. The robot will pick up the glass from the cell and set it right on the component. Resequencing of processes to allow process that can be done earlier to be moved to the stations that are under loaded. Yamazumi chart line balancing is a technique for increasing labor productivity and line efficiency that is result-oriented and performance-based. The analysis reveals that the existing production system was not oriented toward spontaneous flow. The manufacturing process was designed part by part. Yamazumi chart line balancing can be used to implement flow-oriented production, which allows for complete product output from the first day of production planning. To improve productivity and meet customer demand, the assembly line balancing problem is critical in all mass production systems. The primary goal of this study was to investigate the applicability of Theory of constraints (TOC) principles and lean six sigma in the automotive industry. In the manufacturing and service industries, lean manufacturing techniques are widely used. Lean is gaining popularity as a method of reducing time constraints. If Lean is not defined, employee quantity and quality will suffer. The six sigma DMAIC model can be used in the identification of problems in the automotive industry. These defects were reduced by appropriate corrective actions in the improve stage, as well as work standardizations and employee trainings to control these continuous improvements. If we are unable to find a solution with high balancing for a given cycle time for a given assembly line, we can change the cycle time to improve the balancing of the assembly line. If a solution with high balancing can be obtained, changing the cycle time is not necessary to improve balancing. The analysis of trade-offs between cycle time and workstation count helps to provide a better overall assembly line. Balancing assembly lines is a constant research topic, and there are numerous avenues for future investigation. When the workstation time exceeds the standard cycle time, for example, the next workstation is assigned based on the maximally-loaded-workstation-rule. Unbalancing production lines is still an unexplored area of operations research, and a better understanding of their behavior can aid in identifying new approaches and solutions for configuring new lines or improving existing ones. As a result, the scope of this survey is limited to the flow line-balancing problem. The proposed solutions have the potential to provide numerous benefits not only to the company, but also to other entities involved in its operation.

127,Incremental Weak Subgradient Method For Large Scale  Machine Learning Problems,"in optimization problems, when the problem is differentiable, gradient search methods are developed using the gradient concept. when it is nonsmooth, the solution methods are based on the subdifferential concept which is valid under the convexity condition. subgradients defined for convex functions are the general mapping of gradients. if the problem is not convex, the weak subgradient can be used. the weak subgradient is defined with a more analytical approach to nonconvex and nonsmooth optimization problems and it is provided to generalize the concept of subgradient for nonconvex. in the problem of optimizing the sum of a finite number (m ) of functions, incremental methods that use the gradient (or subgradient) of each function one by one work faster than non-incremental methods, especially when the number of m is larger. machine learning problems are optimization problems based on ""minimizing the sum of the finite number of functions"", which is the minimization of the loss function that shows the difference between the real data label and the estimated data label. the semidefinite machine learning problem (sml) contains nonlabelled data and contains nonsmooth nonconvex functions. the aim of this study is to develop an incremental weak subgradient method for sml problems. we work on the incremental weak subgradient method, which starts with an initial solution and calculates a new solution by using the weak subgradient values of one of the functions with random order at the current solution in each subsequent iteration. the convergence properties of the method are investigated and sml problems are solved.",weak subgradient,,"gulcin dinc yalcin eskisehir technical university iki eylul campus engineering faculty department of industrial engineering eskisehir, türkiye gdinc@eskisehir.edu.tr",
128,From Digital Transformation To Sustainability In Smes:  Opportunities For Net Zero Economy,"small and medium enterprises (smes) are major contributors in economy as well as employment of emerging markets. these smes can be categorized into service or manufacturing based industries. manufacturing sector in smes are now being supported by large enterprises as well as many multi-national corporations for service deposition and their expertise in manufacturing of specialized goods. this is the reason these smes are now digitalizing their business models and expanded their market to global level. in this context, large enterprises are also providing industry 4.0 based solutions to these smes to align them with their business models. however, these industries are also realizing the need to reduce environmental impacts of manufacturing by incorporating disruptive technologies i.e., additive manufacturing and iot in their organizations which comes under industry 4.0 umbrella. the studies in literature have highlighted the potential benefits of these technologies to improve economic performance but less attention have been paid towards the sustainability performance in terms of environmental and social benefits. to address this issue a theoretical framework for smes is proposed which can be used to enhance their environmental performance. the proposed framework is validated in the leading manufacturing smes which have incorporated the additive manufacturing operations in their organizations to reduce environmental impacts and improve economic performance. the study also highlights the role of disruptive technologies on the sustainability and discuss how these technologies can improve the economic and environmental performance. the findings indicated that disruptive technologies can improve the environmental performance and create a sustainability roadmap in the initial journey of industry 4.0 practices for smes.","industry 4.0, roadmap, smes, sustainability",,"anbesh jamwal, rajeev agrawal*, monica sharma department of mechanical engineering malaviya national institute of technology jaipur india-302017 anveshjamwal73@gmail.com, *ragrawal.mech@mnit.ac.in , msharma.dms@mnit.ac.in","References

Thus it can be concluded that the service quality variable (X1), store atmosphere (X2), application of health protocols (X3) have a significant influence on repurchase intention (Y). 1. Recommendation For the company • To increase interest in repurchasing, companies can always strive for and evaluate the maximum service quality. In order to generate transactional, referential, preferential, and explorative interest effects • To make customers feel more at ease while shopping, lighting elements in the store's atmosphere can be re- evaluated. Because according to customer feedback, they prefer warmer and brighter light. • The company is expected to more frequently urge employees and all visitors who enter to continue to adhere to the implementation of existing protocols, for example, wearing masks properly inside the store. Or the company can always actively share photo evidence of the sterilization agenda on the company's website or social media in order to gain the trust of customers and encourage transactions or return visits. For academics and general audiences This research can be used as a basis for future research when using the same objects or variables. But it's good that in new research, it is hoped that there will be different variables in order to broaden the scope of research and produce different and more perfect data.

131,Determining The Root Causes Of Boxes Stacking Strength  Failure And Find Possible Solutions,"there are various challenges that manufacturers of corrugated packaging boxes encounter in dealing with waste and customer complaints, and one of them which has been on the increase at xyz boxing is the collapsing of boxes in the market. such complaints result in customer dissatisfaction, and they tend to seek products from other suppliers/competition. the purpose of this study is to find root causes of the recent increase collapsing issues as raised by the customers by evaluating raw materials mechanical performance over the past few years, verify if folding settings affect the box compression strength and compare how design choice (straight crease vs off-set crease) affect box compression strength. supplier 1 for mechanical components was found to be generally performing better as compared to supplier 2, but both suppliers were found to be poor. changing folding settings does not bring about significance change in box compression strength and mckee formular underestimate box compression strength when using edge crush test results to predict the strength of certain box; and that straight crease design delivers better box compression strength results than offset crease design. the proposals from the finding include evaluating all board grades mechanical performance and source the materials as per better performing supplier, including working with the suppliers to find the root cause of raw materials mechanical properties decline.",mckee formular,"and recommendations The following are conclusions and recommendations based on the key findings mentioned above: • Since raw materials performance is on decline, XYZ Boxing must work with the supplier to address such issue. This can be done by meeting on a monthly basis to review the performance of most five used board grades and requesting the supplier to come up with corrective action to address the performance issues • One supplier seems to be performing better than the other, XYZ Boxing can choose which board grades to acquire from which supplier based on the performance of raw materials • Since changing folding settings does not bring improvement in BCT, settings should stay the same as the process capability was seen as better at current settings when compared to experimental settings. • XYZ Boxing should introduce customer requirements at design stage based on stacking practices by the customer for each new product to ensure that such requirements are known and met before even supplying the products. This will eliminate address issues of collapsing with the initial order and address issue of collapsing where the customer changes stacking practices to save shipping costs. One tool that can be used is QFD. • When design changes are implemented, performance of the new design should be tested through entire supply chain to verify that new design will perform at the same level if not better when compared to the old design.","kemlall r. ramdass professor of industrial engineering department of industrial engineering, university of south africa, roodeport, south africa ramdakr@unisa.ac.za michack netshifhefhe student of industrial engineering department of industrial engineering university of south africa,roodeport, south africa 37177540@mylife.unisa.ac.za bongumenzi t mncwango lecturer of industrial engineering department of industrial engineering durban university of technology, durban, south africa bongumenzim@dut.ac.za",

133,Strategic Technology Innovation Management And  Leadership Theory – Knowledge Structure,"strategic technology innovation management (tim) is critical for organizations to evolve and succeed (barney et al., 2011; earle et al., 2019). a recent mckinsey survey (am et al., 2020) indicated that although 90% of executives believed the covid-19 crisis was going to fundamentally change their businesses in the next five years, only 21% felt their organizations were equipped to face the challenge. can effective tim be the “secret source” of competitive differentiation in a world of increasing commoditization of technology building blocks for knowledge-intensive products and services in highly competitive markets? (azam, 2019; mavroeidis & tarnawska, 2017; pisano, 2015). the orchestration of resources and proper setting of directions and priorities are critical for strategic management (sm) and tim integration, representing a fundamental responsibility of leadership roles. thus, to properly comprehend the interrelationship between sm and tim and the challenges associated with said orchestration and prioritization of resources, one needs to consider how leadership affects this dynamic, i.e., look at the interplay of strategic management, technology innovation management, and leadership theory as an interdisciplinary topic. the study aims to conduct a bibliometric review to map the existing interdisciplinary knowledge structure of the three domains, including the critical knowledge base, research front, and key areas of current and future interdisciplinary research. the implication for practitioners of tim is a better understanding of the key interdisciplinary challenges currently under investigation, through a view of both practical and theoretical tools used, leading to a roadmap of topics shaping the evolution of these synergistic domains.",leadership theory,,"and research front implications flavio lobo and mesut akdere technology leadership and innovation department, polytechnic institute purdue university west lafayette, in 47907, usa lobof@purdue.edu, makdere@purdue.edu","References

134,Effect Of Spot-Welding Parameters On The Strength Of The  Weld Of Metal Sheets,"resistance spot welding is one of the most common welding techniques used in the automotive and aviation industries. in the present research, the effect of resistance spot welding parameters such as, holding time, squeeze time, welding current, force applied, and welding time will be examined using simufact welding 2020, a welding simulation application. the impact of these parameters on the strength of the weld in metal sheets are studied. each parameter was studied separately by changing one parameter within the range values and other parameters as constant values. it was found that the best region for the following spot-welding parameters is, from 0.9 s to 0.95 for squeeze time, 6.5 ka to 7.5 ka for welding current, 0.15 s to 0.4 s welding time, 30 ms for holding time, and 3.2 kn to 3.4 kn for electrode force. these parameter ranges are best to provide a spot weld with the highest yield stress.","simulation, automotive, metal sheets","Further Research As for future research, further exploration for other spot-welding parameters that can affect the yield stress of the spotted weld such as, radians of the c-gun, the shape of the electrode rods and type of material. All of these parameters have an effect on the strength of the spotted weld affecting the quality and properties of the final product. Furthermore, using Matlab to find a formulate a prediction model and optimization equation of the experiment is advised as using the latest technology in research would allow to obtain more accurate and precise readings. 6. Conclusion The present study attempted to simulate the effect of various welding process parameters on spot weld quality by analyzing the yield stress. The Simufact 2020 welding simulation application was used to determine the maximum yield stress for each parameter. The simulations were performed by using the same initial file that contains the clamps to prevent any error that may be caused due to difference in positioning of clamps or in position of the spot weld. The effect of spot-welding parameters was achieved by keeping all parameters constant and changing the studied parameter within the range. The yield stress was collected after each run and summarized in graphs to understand basic trends and relationships between each set. It was found out that the highest yield stress welds can be performed at a holding time of 0.9 ms to 0.95 ms, welding current between 6.5 kA to 7.5 kA, welding time between 0.15 s to 0.4 s, hold time of 30 ms, and electrode force between 3.2 kN and 3.4 kN. The trends were characterized by a positive linear relationship. These conditions resulted in highest values of recorded yield stress of the spot welded. Therefore, the effect of each parameter on yield stress were found out using the simulation.","rashed khader, anasmon valappil, mohamed murad, and jabr abu qudeiri college of engineering, mechanical engineering department uae university, uae 201815170@uaeu.ac.ae, 202170080@uaeu.ac.ae, 201850033@uaeu.ac.ae, jqudeiri@uaeu.ac.ae",

From market aspect, the payment is very flexible based on progress term payment or down payment. From the economic aspect, the shipyard can manage the payment by purchasing the wood to be stored to anticipate the price increasing. From the technical aspect, they tend to still utilize human labor due to the location of the business location which is on the seafront so they take advantage of this opportunity. From financial aspect, the BEP value and the profit target is less than 1. It means that the business is well prospect and running. From customer needs, customer tend to be more flexible when they know beforehand about the company and the boat that they sell. There’s also a supporting factor where if the customer can see the process of the boat building, they can monitor and ask for customization.","yugowati praharsi1, muhammad abu jami’in2 and devina puspita sari3 business management1,3 and electrical engineering department2 shipbuilding institute of polytechnic surabaya (politeknik perkapalan negeri surabaya) surabaya, indonesia yugowati@ppns.ac.id",

141,Developing A Smart Home Energy Management System And  Economic Feasibility Analysis Of Residential Renewable,"there has been an increase in the use of photovoltaic (pv) systems in residential buildings due to their growing accessibility and affordability, as well as the shift in consumer preferences toward more environmentally friendly and sustainable energy generation alternatives. moreover, these systems are highly effective in reducing the increasing cost of electricity supplied from the grid. the emergence of the internet of things (iot) technologies, such as smart home appliances, that can be controlled remotely or directly reveals a potential for maximizing the benefits of these renewable generators. to realize this potential, this study develops a home energy management system (hems) that minimizes the electricity cost and maximizes customer satisfaction by scheduling the run times of appliances and the charging and discharging times of the integrated storage system. the system considers the electricity tariff rates that vary depending on energy consumption levels and the ability to import from and export to the grid. we developed a mixed integer programming formulation and a novel heuristic algorithm and implemented them in cplex opl and python, respectively. we developed a user-friendly decision support system to help the average user schedule household appliances. we also analyzed many scenarios to investigate the economic feasibility of utilizing pv panels using actual data from oman. we determined the breakeven points for different parameters and performed sensitivity analyses.","smart energy, economic, feasibility",,"generators in oman rayyan al kharusi sultan qaboos university, oman s127006@student.squ.edu.om",
142,Integrated Team Planning And Maintenance  Scheduling For Geographically,"maintaining geographically distributed assets (gda) requires complex team planning and scheduling decisions. recently, many approaches have been introduced in the literature to solve this complex optimization problem. however, most of the introduced optimization models in the literature have considered this problem in its simplest form without involving realistic features such as precedence constraints, temporal dimension, and multiple depots. therefore, the developed solutions are unlikely to be applicable in real-life systems. this study aims to determine the optimal number of teams and their schedules over a planning horizon to minimize the total cost associated with performing a group of maintenance activities in gda. we formulated the problem as a mixed integer linear programming (milp) model, which considers the release dates, due dates, interdependencies, teams working hours, and assets availability. the model is a more realistic variant of the multi-depot multi-period vehicle routing problem. as far as we know, this is the first study to consider all these features simultaneously. vrp is a well-known np-hard problem; therefore, we developed a novel hybrid metaheuristic algorithm to solve large practical instances of the problem. we combined genetic algorithm with a problem-specific solution encoding with a simulated annealing algorithm (gasa) to facilitate the search. we implemented the milp model in ibm cplex opl and coded gasa in python. we performed an extensive computational study to test the performance of the proposed solution methods. the results over 600 instances revealed that gasa has a stable behavior dealing with different levels of the problem’s complexity, including the number of activities, assets, depots, days, teams, and interdependent activities. the milp model is solved with a one-hour time limit. for the problem instances optimally solved by milp, gasa provided solutions with an average error of 0.13%. furthermore, when the milp model was stopped due to the time limit, gasa produced an average of 4.4% better solutions than milp. gasa was able to solve all instances in reasonable solution times. the performance of gasa was also demonstrated by real-life case studies of gda maintenance systems of one of the leading companies in the energy sector in oman. the results proved the effectiveness of gasa by generating solutions with an average of 39% less than the actual paid cost and 94% faster than the time spent on planning. the cost reductions in several instances reached up to 50%. the case study proved that the proposed gasa model is a promising tool to reduce the operational cost of the business and, accordingly, increase the company’s profits.",team planning,,"distributed assets aza al riyami, hakan gultekin, emad summad department of mechanical and industrial engineering college of engineering, sultan qaboos university muscat, oman s103055@student.squ.edu.om, hgultekin@squ.edu.om, esummad@squ.edu.om",

PLS was used because the method found out the influence between variables whereas SEM can simultaneously evaluate the dependent relationship between measured variables (price perception, COVID-19 prevention service, and customer satisfaction) and latent constructs as well as the relationship between latent variables. This study would like to fill the research gap in ride-hailing customer satisfaction studies in a developing country such as Indonesia in the new normal era. The result shows that COVID-19 prevention services affected price perception in ride-hailing customers significantly. Moreover, price perception and COVID-19 prevention service directly influence customer satisfaction significantly. Customers are satisfied with ride-hailing because of their good COVID-19 prevention services. Even after the pandemic, price perception is still a significant aspect of customer satisfaction. However, the COVID-19 prevention service does not have a significant indirect effect on customer satisfaction through price perception as a mediator variable. Thus, price perception can’t be a mediator for those two variables. The result of the F² value for the COVID-19 Prevention Service variable is 0.22, this value is included in the moderate category, so eliminating this variable will affect the other two variables and the model fit. The R2 value for the price perception variable is 0.177 (weak level), while for the customer satisfaction variable it is 0.35 (normal level). The predictive relevance assessment (Q2) shows a value of 0.207 for the variable customer satisfaction and 0.079 for price perception, so it can be said that each variable has predictive relevance. Measurement of the fit model in this study shows quite good numbers with an SRMR value is 0.059 and an NFI value is 0.9. Thus, it can be said that this model is fit for the results of data collection. From the results, companies can apply several strategies to increase customer satisfaction. The first strategy is to develop exclusive features for female customers which can be done by increasing the security guarantee. The second strategy is to improve health protocols in the new normal era, so that prevention services can meet the expectations of customers. The final strategy is to strengthen market position with operational excellence, so the costs applied are minimum costs and services can be provided at relatively low prices.","delinda amarajaya, theodora rinda hernawati, and adji candra kurniawan department of logistic engineering universitas pertamina jakarta, indonesia delindaamarajaya@gmail.com; rindatheodora@gmail.com",
144,A Framework For Data-Driven Decision-Making For Cost  Analysis Of Implementing Iot In Warehouses,"managing warehouse operations poses a continuous challenge for companies due to associated costs and expenses. inefficient utilization of warehouses leads to many undesired outcomes such as loss of manpower hours spent in storing or retrieving goods, degradation and obsoleteness of materials, etc. therefore, optimizing the warehouse operations and improving its management will affect costs significantly. nonetheless, it becomes necessary to first define the factors that affect the cost. this can be achieved by collecting related data, and then developing a sustainable and effective warehouse management system that can derive decisions accordingly. furthermore, the nature of warehousing is becoming more dynamic such that the storing requirement is subjected to specific inputs and outputs related to, temperature, humidity, lightening, beside dedicated arrangements, etc. thus, the ability to acquire a range of inputs, integrate and analyze them, is necessary to meet this objective. iot technology support is a key pillar of the data-gathering process that enables it to provide reliable data that can be utilized. despite all the hype around iot as a decision-support tool, improper implementation might lead to an ineffective system. therefore, it is beneficial to evaluate the impact of adopting such technology. hence, the objective of this project is to develop a framework for data-driven decision-making for cost analysis of implementing iot in warehouses. to achieve this, a well-structured methodology is followed. the first phase of the methodology employed in this study included conducting an extensive literature review aimed at identifying cost-effective factors contributing to the implementation of iot in warehouses. the literature review papers were found using specified key words such as iot, warehouse, big data, cost-effective factors, and data-driven decision-making. research papers related to the subject from trusted journals were chosen. in the second phase, the factors were gathered and classified based on specific criteria. then, they were subjected to a filtering methodology. here, the total number of factors that was collected in the literature review phase initially exceeded 290. then, using the systematic approach to study and analyze the collected data lead to group the factors into 35 main factors and 71 subfactors. in next phases of this project, those factors will be subjected to a common method bias test to ensure that the relationships between factors are not biased. this result will be statistically analyzed to rank them. this will be done 1121",,,"razan al khambashi, fatema al jadidi, wasan al siyabi and sharifa al riyami undergraduate students of industrial engineering mechanical and industrial engineering department sultan qaboos university muscat, oman nasr al hinai associate professor and the head of mechanical and industrial engineering department sultan qaboos university muscat, oman niyazi onur bakır associate professor of industrial engineering sultan qaboos university muscat, oman",

This is especially the case since lean production techniques need to be applied to the agriculture 4.0 revolution to improve both efficiency and effectiveness. This is because, IoT in agriculture allows for greater production control and cost-efficient management through the use of smart devices such as the micro controllers. As such, producers can accurately identify anomalies in crops and prevent infestations that harm yields by improving the disease prediction capabilities. The sensors installed in agricultural machinery can also help save on irrigation and fertilization costs. Additionally, these sensors can be programmed to notify producers of the ideal harvest time, leading to less waste in the crop. Therefore, this will result in proactive agricultural farming, and this will reduce waster waste and crop damage.","mr. rubalavanyan vamadeva university of dubai bba entrepreneurship final year student s0000001904@ud.ac.ae dr. nasser a. saif almuraqab dubai business school, university of dubai nasser@ud.ac.ae mr. yassin m nour khatib first year student, mechatronics freelancer s0000003247@ud.ac.ae",

Based on the results of calculations and data analysis After doing practical work, the authors found several problems in the PT Krakatau Jasa Logistik company, namely the layout of the warehouse, which was not neatly organized and did not have partitions for storing cargo which resulted in a lot of empty space to separate cargo from one another so that it did not mix. Companies often lack warehouses to store future cargo and this result in companies having to conduct surveys to find vacant warehouses according to the company's needs and SOPs for storing these cargoes, which results in companies having to incur more costs. Companies that still use a manual system make workers have to recap daily reports and recap as a whole at the end of the month, which results in frequent human errors. Judging from the closed warehouse and the lack of air circulation, the cargo stored in the warehouse is still in bulk form, or raw materials that are not packed using sacks can make the cargo moist, and the quality will decrease. To maximize cargo storage in the warehouse, partitions per block are made to maximize unused empty space and minimize the mixing of cargo with one another. Using the dedicated storage method, it will make it easier for companies to store cargo, inspect warehouses, and look for cargo in warehouses because warehouses have been 1155","dedicated storage method (case study: pt krakatau jasa logistic) helshy azzahra nur el islami logistics engineering pertamina university jakarta, indonesia 102419036@student.universitaspertamina.ac.id resista vikaliana lecturer in logistics engineering faculty of industrial technology universitas pertamina mailto:resista.vikaliana@universitaspertamina.ac.id","References

The market penetration strategy is currently the best strategy to develop the number of application users. This needs to be done by the application because there is a large market potential from bank customers who are not yet application users. The large potential of customers makes the potential unreachable for applications, so market development for large potential customers needs to be considered. Another strategy is to introduce applications to several areas that have not been optimally reached. The use of social media is a good attraction for efforts to introduce applications widely. Introducing public awareness of digital financial applications for MSME’s banks is very important because the potential circulation of money that is so large at the level of micro, small, and medium transactions is a potential for a large increase in revenue for banks through application transactions.","indonesia largest msme’s bank kevin prasetio1 and yenita2 faculty of economics and business universitas tarumanagara jakarta, 11440, indonesia kevin.117212027@stu.untar.ac.id, yenita@fe.untar.ac.id",

151,13Th International Conference On Industrial Engineering And Operations Management  Determining The Differences In Performance Between Two,"the technique for site surveys at telecommunication towers in malaysia has always been the conventional way rather than the new technique. a radio frequency (rf) site survey is arranging and scheming a wireless network to administer a wireless elucidation that will give the necessary circumstances. the results of these rf readings using a spectrum analyser to determine the non-overlapping frequencies when planning for a new rf transmission later. the current rf observation process may be time-consuming, but the safety and accuracy could be improved, affecting cost and quality. there have been many past tests that have used drones as tools to carry tools according to their respective objectives based on previous research, and most carry an improvement. the information gathered on whether the conventional or the new technique is more sustainable, which based on a case study on several similar sites using two distinct techniques, the conventional and a drone, as carrier agents of measurement tools. from the comparison, the rf scanning survey using the drone technique was much faster in execution, cheaper, and collected better data than the conventional method. this proves that this new technique can be practised for how it works in the future.","radio frequency, frequency scanning","Table 4 outlines the RF site survey using a drone, showing that it excels in the Project Management Triangle, which is cheaper, much faster, and has higher quality data than the conventional method. It is sufficient to say that the drone RF site survey is a more sustainable practice for the future. Table 4. Comparison of conventional and drone method Conventional Drone Work Flow Long and tedious Much faster and more efficient Frequency Data Collected Datasets that are not highly accurate and limited A much better output as it eliminates human errors and risk Time Completion It was very slow as it needed time to set up and follow the SOP given by the authority. Very fast and efficient as it eliminates the need for setup for every site and workflow. RSL measurement Observations can only be made on the rest platform, where it is often not accurate to the objective frequency path causing low RSL strength, and some RSLs cannot be observed Using a drone as a carrier agent can be done exactly to the objective, and there is no need for humans to climb many benefits in terms of safety, and time can also be done immediately in every situation, including in times of disaster. Based on the comparisons, we can conclude that the new RF site survey method using drones as the carrier for measurement tools is better than the conventional method. The RF site survey is a lot faster in terms of execution which is the ratio is 8 to 1. This practice is not just great but also can increase productivity. The workflow of the work that needs to be done is also cut, thus shortening the operation schedule. The cost for the RF site survey using the drone is also much cheaper since the cost that must be spent is only for the drone, the competent person, and many more. The RF site survey using drone also collect better data than the conventional method. This proves that the RF site survey using the drone is a more sustainable practice for the future. It can be said that practitioners look forward to using drone technique methods in the future. Acknowledgments We express our sincere gratitude to SKMG Asia Technology Sdn.

152,A Review Of How Occupant Behaviour Determines The  Energy Efficiency Of Green Buildings: A Case Of Office,"in most countries, buildings consume about 50% of the total energy. high energy consumption is still addressed by stakeholders through traditional technical methods, such as design considerations. however, studies suggest that strategic actions achieve a zero net energy or low energy goal depending on the behaviour of building occupants. the objective of this study is to develop methods for modeling and evaluating occupant behaviour in green office buildings. specifically, this paper aims to present the research questions and hypotheses for the main investigation and to identify the predictors of occupant behaviour in conventional and green buildings based on a literature review. the research found that the behaviour of building occupants in interacting with or using the building, such as using blinds, and curtains, controlling lighting, opening and closing windows, the way they dress, and the temperature of their drinking water to adjust the indoor environment to their needs or tastes, has a strategic impact on the energy performance and consumption of the building. the study also found that the building envelope, building services, natural ventilation, daylighting, artificial lighting, and thermal comfort are the most important predictors of occupant behaviour in green office buildings. user satisfaction with the building depends on user interaction with the building system and the extent of user adaptation and social value systems. it is found that the ontology of positivism and the epistemology of objectivism are the appropriate metaphysical orientations for the main research. the main research includes qualitative and quantitative data. the results suggest that performance surveys, simulations, experiments, case studies, and questionnaires are appropriate for the main research.","thermoregulation, thermal comfort, research design","and further research Even though research on this topic is increasing, it is still in its infancy. Most of the extant studies are based on literature reviews or sponsored studies. The list of what the researchers think to be the reality of energy management in office buildings will include many superfluous constructs while leaving out many vital constructs if this is not the case. The research design for the main research was presented. This research argued for multiple techniques of data collection to predict the model performance of the buildings. Occupant behaviour has a significant impact on the building's energy consumption. To increase office occupant productivity and satisfaction and to maximize the building's energy performance, there is a need to model the energy performance of the buildings using multiple approaches of the survey, simulation, case study, and experiments. In particular, occupant behaviour is not assimilated into the building energy management model.

153,Image Comparison For Finding The Lowest Priced Unique  Commodities In An Online Retail Store,"the impact of e-commerce and the ever-increasing integration of the online world to the daily lives of citizens are the driving reasons for the creation of this thesis. to help streamline the user’s shopping experience, the e-commerce cheapest clusterer (eccc) achieves this goal by doing its namesake: to group similar products into corresponding clusters and select the most affordable product in each of the clusters. the result is then displayed in an easy-to-browse interface that directly connects to the project’s target website, lazada. the images are compared using the structural similarity index measure (ssim). if the value returned by the ssim function is greater than a certain threshold, the image enters the same cluster as the one it was compared to. to ensure efficiency, this paper also investigates the results of different threshold values. setting a lower threshold value resulted in the algorithm finishing faster at the cost of several misplaced images in clusters, whereas a higher threshold value gave the program a considerable runtime but was less prone to misidentification. additionally, the testing also revealed that setting the threshold value too high can hinder the program’s ability to cluster similar images even if the difference is slight.","e-commerce, image comparison, ssim, cheapest selection","At the beginning of the paper, the problem of convenience regarding online shopping was brought up and has been the central objective of the project. The system was able to accomplish each step as outlined and produces an output within the expectations of the research. In addition, the system was also tested on different parameters and test cases in order to help identify the matters that could be finetuned. As demonstrated in the discussion of results, there was a clear pattern that emerged when setting up the threshold of the image processing algorithm. Because a lower threshold meant that the compared images could be less similar to each other, the system would only generate fewer clusters. While the number of clusters itself was not a problem, it was instead the number of misidentified images within each 1226","miguel nicolas alcantara, stefen genoa decena, john lenard guevarra college of computer studies angeles university foundation angeles city, philippines alcantara.miguelnicolas@auf.edu.ph, decena.stefengenoa@auf.edu.ph, guevarra.johnlenard@auf.edu.ph ray nicolas college of computer studies, faculty angeles university foundation angeles city, philippines ray.nicolas@auf.edu.ph","References

Through the integration of various elements of the supply chain, such as suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, and customers, businesses can improve their performance, innovation, and competitiveness. This is achieved through the sharing of information, resources, and collaboration between different supply chain stakeholders. However, the supply chain integration also requires the consideration of various factors, such as IT capabilities, HR strategies, trust, and social capital, to achieve optimal results. In addition, the integration of the supply chain also has an impact on sustainability, as it allows for the implementation of green practices and the promotion of social responsibility. Therefore, it is important for businesses to prioritize supply chain integration in their marketing efforts to drive growth and success.

156,Critical Success Factors Of Lean Six Sigma Implementations  In Philippine Food Manufacturing Companies,"lean six sigma (lss) is a data-driven philosophy that drives performance improvement by eliminating waste and reducing variability. food manufacturing (fm) companies introduce programs like lss to improve competitiveness. however, lss implementations are complicated and complex. companies must carefully manage the implementation of lss to achieve the desired outcomes. in line with this, proper management of critical success factors (csfs) can enhance the initiative’s chances of success. this research aims to identify, rank, and understand the csfs, and recommend strategies to manage them within philippine fm companies. a combined approach of structured literature review, structured survey, and structured interview were used to gather the necessary data. the thematic analysis and relative importance index method revealed that there are 15 csfs. these csfs were synthesized into 4 clusters: synergy, expertise in lss, effective management, and dedicated leadership. thus, to be successful, all stakeholders within the company must have the essential hard and soft skills to execute the dmaic framework and manage the initiative as a whole. more importantly, they must have the proper working environment, be aligned to the intended goal, and fully cooperate and contribute to the activities that must be accomplished to achieve the target future state.","lean, six sigma, implementation","to Research Question 2: Does the LSS framework address these CSFs? If not, what can be improved on the framework to help address the CSFs? Utilizing thematic analysis, the researcher identified that the CSFs can be addressed throughout the current DMAIC framework and the encompassing LSS program of the implementing organization. However, to address the CSFs, the experts commented that the DMAIC framework must be rigorously followed and properly delivered. In addition, an LSS program must be in place to ensure a holistic and sustainable approach to the initiative and, more importantly, prepare the company for the changes that will be implemented. Therefore, by following these, the belters can ensure they can satisfy the CSFs and guarantee the success of their LSS implementation. While it is mentioned that the current LSS framework is sufficient to address the CSFs, the experts still suggested the following opportunities for improvement: (1) the explicit inclusion of the CSF Employee Benefits, Incentives, and Rewards in the DMAIC framework and the overall LSS program, (2) the increased emphasis on the use of the most recent technologies when brainstorming solutions in the Improve Phase, and (3) the addition of the Benchmarking Phase before the Improve Phase. It is important to recognize that these suggestions are aimed at increasing the chances of success to address the CSFs and updating the methodology to the present-day economic and technological landscape. 6.3 Recommendations It is imperative that the LSS belters and FM companies address the 15 CSFs to succeed in implementing LSS in their organizations. This is because the CSFs hold a special role in ensuring good LSS implementation practices are achieved. Given this, out of the 15 CSFs, 6 CSFs aimed at ensuring that there is Synergy between all the relevant stakeholders. 3 CSFs are directed to make sure that there is sufficient Expertise in LSS within the company. In addition, 4 CSFs are designed to guarantee that Effective Management of the LSS project and the program as a whole is present throughout. Finally, 2 CSFs are focused on ensuring that Dedicated Leadership is available to support the initiative. In addressing the CSFs, LSS belters, and FM companies must properly build a holistic LSS program first, as this will support the CSFs and the implementation as a whole. They must not immediately dive in and execute an LSS project without laying the groundworks for the complete continuous improvement program. Therefore, practitioners must not rush in the implementation of LSS as this negatively affects the perception of the initiative. On the project level, the DMAIC framework is a complete and sufficient approach to address the CSFs, as mentioned in the previous sections. Given this, the belters must be thorough and careful in following the steps and activities within the DMAIC framework to fully address each of the CSFs. Thus, to be successful in implementing LSS, all stakeholders within the company must have the necessary hard and soft skills to execute the DMAIC framework and manage the initiative as a whole. More importantly, they must have the proper working environment, be aligned to the intended goal, and fully cooperate and contribute to the activities that must be accomplished to achieve the target future state.","robert james a. paulmino the graduate school university of santo tomas manila, philippines robertjames.paulmino.gs@ust.edu.ph charlie a. marquez department of industrial engineering and the graduate school university of santo tomas manila, philippines camarquez@ust.edu.ph",

158,Passive Design Approach To Improve Energy Efficiency For  Office Building,"this research aimed to investigate the impact of passive design techniques on building envelope design. whereas assessment of the heat transfer rate through building envelopes is frequently done using the ottv standards worldwide. the research includes two parameters for measuring the thermal performance of the building facade. the first measurement uses a methodical approach to calculate the wall's thermal transmittance (u-values) and then moves on to calculate the ottv. the ottv of the case study was computed using the ottv formula given by the malaysian standard. at the same time, building specifications were determined via a site examination. after that, the ottv was compared with a recommended standard value for the local climate. new building materials and specifications are proposed when the ottv value exceeds the standard range. the results indicated that the present ottv value is 55.31 w/sq.m, more significant than the proposed value for a standard commercial building. it recommended considering 6 mm single glazing low e-glass for all windows on the east, west, south, and north elevations. as a result, the ottv was lowered to 45.34 w/sq.m. since air conditioning consumes most of the energy in an office building, lowering the ottv will result in a slightly reduced air-conditioning cooling load.","green building, building facade, tropical climate",,"muhammad tarique lakhiar, shalini sanmargaraja, abdullateef olanrewaju, and chong hooi lim faculty of engineering and green technology, universiti tunku abdul rahman, jalan universiti bandar barat, 31900, kampar perak, malaysia muhammadtarique954@gmail.com; shalinis@utar.edu.my; olanrewaju@utar.edu.my; limchongh@utar.edu.my vignes ponniah faculty of science and engineering, manchester metropolitan university, united kingdom v.ponniah@mmu.ac.uk anselm dass mathalamuthu school of architecture, tunku abdul rahman universiti of management and technology, jalan genting kelang, setapak 53300 kuala lumpur anselmdass@tarc.edu.my","References

159,A Heuristic Algorithm For Determining The Order Of  Arima Models,"autoregressive integrated moving average (arima) models have been proven successful in application and simple in comprehension and consequently, they have been widely applied to different fields in forecasting. the order of an arima model is determined subjectively based on the judgment of the experts where, the autocorrelation function (acf) and partial autocorrelation function (pacf) plots for a given time series are used to determine the potential orders of the model. in this paper, a new heuristic algorithm is proposed for determining the order of arima models. the proposed method determines the order of the arima models, objectively, based on the mean squared error (mse), akaike information criterion (aic), and schwarz bayesian information criterion (bic). in this regard, the order of the models is determined objectively and as a result, the forecasting results would be more accurate. the performance of the proposed method is evaluated based on a real-world dataset of global temperature anomaly where, the results show that the proposed method performs accurately and efficiently in determining the order of arima models.","box-jenkins models, business","To determine the order of ARIMA model effectively, a large number of historical data is often required. Furthermore, order estimation based on ACF and PACF plots often results in finding many potential models. These competing models can be biased. In this paper, a new heuristic algorithm has been introduced to determine the order of ARIMA models. The proposed method determines the order of the ARIMA model based on statistical selection criteria MSE, AIC and BIC. Also, the proposed method creates more objective results. The proposed algorithm is applied on a case study related to temperature anomaly where the results are promising. It indicates that the proposed method is efficient for determining the order of the ARIMA model. Future research should consider the potential effects of seasonality more carefully. For example, SARIMA models can be taken into account. In addition, parsimoniousness can be addressed in the proposed algorithm.","shima soltanzadeh, melika modarres vahid, and majid khedmati1 department of industrial engineering sharif university of technology tehran, iran shima.soltanzadeh@ie.sharif.edu, melika.modarres@ie.sharif.edu, khedmati@sharif.edu",

163,Nft  Coin Price Prediction (Non-Fungible Token)  Using K-Nearest Neighbors Method,"nft or non-fungible tokens are online certificates of ownership that can be traded, based on data units stored in digital ledgers (ledgers) belonging to blockchain technology. non-fungible means that it cannot be exchanged and is unique. nft has been around since 2014. but now, it is increasingly being considered as a fairly practical method for trading digital artwork or art. to buy nft assets, it requires special coins in the form of nft coins, which consist of various types, such as mana coins, sand, axs and other nft coins. the nft coins are used to process nft purchase transactions. the movement of nft coins over time is relatively erratic and uncertain. this nft coin price prediction will be very useful for investors to know how the investment flow of each price works, because the price of each nft coin will change from time to time. through the literature study stage, interviews and viewing daily nft coin price data where the attributes used are date, open, high, low, close volume, and marketcap. based on the experimental knn (k-nearest neighbors) method on a data set using the parameter values of k 3, 5, and 7, it can be said that the knn model that has the best accuracy is knn with a value of k=7 with an accuracy of 65% . the greater the value, the greater the mean square error and mean absolute error values. the research conducted predicts the close value of the nft coin price in a period of 1 day.","blockchain, sand","The conclusions from the research carried out are: From the experimental results of the KNN method (K-Nearest Neighbors) on the dataset using the K3 value parameters obtained an accuracy of 45%, K5 50%, and K7 65%, it can be concluded that the KNN model has the most accuracy good is KNN with a value of K = 7 with an accuracy value of 65%. The greater the value of K, the greater the value of the Mean Square Error and Mean Absolute Error. The research conducted predicts the Close value of NFT coin prices over a period of 1 day.","adena wahyu gumelar, tacbir hendro pudjiantoro informatics department faculty of science and informatics universitas jenderal achmad yani cimahi, indonesia adenawahyug18@if.unjani.ac.id puspita nurul sabrina informatics department faculty of science and informatics universitas jenderal achmad yani cimahi, indonesia pns@if.unjani.ac.id",
164,Role Of Disruptive Technologies In Realizing Virtual Tourism,"with the advent of digital technology, disruptive innovation is a strategy that is being adopted both by the manufacturing as well as the service industry. disruptive digital technology like smartphone technology, social media, internet, and mobile applications have led to business to business (b2b), peer to peer (p2p), and business to consumer (b2c) strategies promising shared economy for tourism destinations. technological disruptions such as iot, artificial intelligence and rich media like virtual and augmented reality, parallel reality have created smarter environments that transformed tourism in terms of its structure, processes, and practices. it is a relatively modern form of technology, introduced to the existing tourism market which enables service providers in creating a unique experience for their customers. here the customers motivate others in order to reap the benefits of technology-driven product (danneels, 2004). these technologies create entirely new products and services that are dramatically cheaper, better, and more convenient forcing change in the whole new competitive industrial workforce. such innovations are because of continuous scientific discoveries for a more technology-driven competitive paradigm (kostoff et.al. 2004). the emergence of such smart environments will redefine the tourism sector as customer experience solely prevails on varying levels of infrastructure, organization, and cultural constraints (buhalis et.al. 2019). the paper tries to explore various disruptive technologies that could be used for promoting tourism in a destination, forcing stakeholders to rethink and reengineer their services in this competitive ever-changing world.","virtual tourism, technology, iot, ai",,"sindhu r babu asst. professor school of tourism studies mahatma gandhi university kottayam kerala, india sindhurbabu@mgu.ac.in suresh subramoniam director cet school of management college of engineering trivandrum sureshsubramoniam@gmail.com","References

The five main criteria are organizational, social, technical, environmental, and availability. The expert analysis and confirmation survey re- confirmed our conclusion that the main challenges of COVID-19 vaccine distribution and administration are the rumor spreading/false knowledge, the lack of vaccine awareness in society, and the lack of medical personnel involved. We can also conclude that the humanitarian supply chain context in the case of vaccine administration needs more attention as the social aspect is part of the supply and demand. This study can be extended to other cities of countries to find the main challenges in COVID-19 vaccine distribution and administration.","bandung indonesia vina sari yosephine, kevin sudarman, leo rama kristiana industrial engineering department institut teknologi harapan bangsa bandung, indonesia vinayosephine@ithb.ac.id",
166,Master Production Scheduling Requirements And Blood  Transfusion Sustainability.,"the purpose of the study is to find the effect of master production scheduling (mps) requirements on blood transfusion sustainability (bts). data was collected from 213 respondents of regional and transfusing staff of government university teaching hospital blood banks using a self-administered questionnaire. simple random sampling was used to draw the sample. finally, a model including mps requirements and bts was validated with a path analysis. the results of this study showed a positive significant effect of mps requirements on bts with the prediction rate of 27.1% and in the 95% confidence level. key words blood bank, blood transfusion sustainability (bts), master production scheduling (mps), structural equation modelling (sem), uganda 1. introduction blood transfusion is necessary in addressing any blood shortages, illnesses and disorders in the human body (lestari et al. 2017; seed et al. 2018). sustainable blood transfusion is crucial in extending and improving life for many patients (kruk et al. 2018; mulcahy et al. 2017). world health organization (who) global report (2010) indicated that blood transfusion would drastically reduce the death figures of people that emanate from road traffic accidents (1.2 million), cardiovascular disease (2.5 million), malaria (1 million), tuberculosis (900,000), and maternal complications (132,500). in sub-saharan africa, lack of safe, timely and full product range of blood units lead to about 300,000 pregnant women and 3 million children below the age of 5 years dying annually (checkley et al. 2019). safe, timely and full product range of blood units are essential for both non-normal and normal healthcare for and during transfusion (checkley et al. 2019; thomas et al. 2017). world health organization recommend use of voluntary non- remunerated donors to achieve bts in most parts of africa through encouraging more voluntary non-remunerated blood donors (vnrds), testing for transfusion transmissible infections (ttis), as well establishing interventions for hospital best use of blood (aneke and okocha 2017). mulcahy et al. (2017) suggested that robust blood transfusion system is one that scored high on the following three factors: safety levels, full range of blood units, and timely delivery such that patient health and scheduled transfusion services are not unduly compromised. however, globally failure to match blood supply to demand has continued to result into unfavourable transfusion outcomes like forced prioritisation, postponement, cancellation and death (jenny et al. 2017; kanagasabai et al. 2018; opoka et al. 2018). 1342",,,"using sem approach kaconco james, dr. nabuuma betty, prof. kirabira john baptist mechanical engineering department, school of engineering, college of engineering, design, art and technology (cedat), makerere university, p.o. box 7062, kampala, uganda. james.kaconco@.mak.ac.ug, betty.nabuuma@mak.ac.ug, kirabirajb@gmail.com dr. mugarura jude thaddeo college of business and management sciences (cobams), makerere university, p.o. box 7062, kampala, uganda. judethaddeo.mugarura@mak.ac.ug","References

169,Effect Of Performance Discrepancy Of Cells On The  Reliability Analysis Of An Ev Battery Pack,"with the rapid development of electric vehicle (ev), researches related to ev battery systems have flourished in recent years, partly because the battery system accounts for almost half of the cost of an ev. for the battery system, its capacity degraded gradually along with charge-and-discharge cycles and hence increases the risk of the ev. the reliability issue of the battery system thus arises. the present study proposes an analytical model based on reliability engineering for studying the capacity degradation and quantitative reliability of ev battery packs. the model, in turn, is constructed in consideration of states of health (soh) of battery cells and their uncertainties. as compared to the traditional system reliability model that judges the pack’s reliability purely based on considering if or not a battery cell’s soh exceeds a prescribed threshold, the proposed model adopts the k-out-of-n system reliability concept and considers that sohs of battery cells within the pack do not differ too much to assure the pack’s reliability. this study also adjusts a few parametric values in the model to investigate their influences on battery pack’s life and reliability. through numerical case studies, it is found the proposed model results in a more conservative system reliability prediction of a battery pack than the traditional model, and the capacity degradation trend of the battery pack coincides with a real case. in consideration of an effective battery management system that avoids fierce temperature changes, the influence of temperature is not very obvious in this study. the uneven performance of battery cells reflected by discrepancies of their sohs is found crucial to the battery pack. if the performance of each battery cell is balanced, the battery pack’s life and reliability would increase significantly. the above trends coincide with those factors considered in a real battery management system (bms) of an ev.","electric vehicle, battery system, state of health",,"pin-chen wang, yung-cheng tseng and wen-fang wu department of mechanical engineering national taiwan university taipei, taiwan r10522541@ntu.edu.tw; b05502039@ntu.edu.tw; wfwu@ntu.edu.tw",
170,Life Modeling And Reliability Analysis Of Lithium-Ion  Batteries Used In Electric Vehicles,"lithium-ion batteries have gradually become the mainstream of batteries used in electric vehicles due to their advantages such as high energy density and long lifetime. this research aims to establish a reliability-based mathematical model that considers uncertainties of the degradation of lithium-ion batteries. the model can be used to evaluate the lifetime distribution and reliability of a selected type of lithium-ion battery. based on the actual battery test data, this research considers battery performance under different operational environments as well as the uncertainty existed for each battery and proposes two capacity loss formulas to describe respectively the declines of battery capacity along with time when it is in storage and charge-and-discharge cycle when it is in use. according to the model, the battery lifetime distribution and reliability can be evaluated, and the failure probability of the battery at any given time can be obtained. this research also converts a vehicle’s daily driving distance into a random depth of discharge, and explores the impact of different driving habits and charging methods on battery degradation. research results show that state of charge (soc) is one of the main factors affecting battery degradation. it is also found that selecting a lower battery charging limit and avoiding frequent shallow discharge under high soc can slow down the degradation, and greatly extend the lifetime and improve the reliability of the battery.","electric vehicle, capacity loss",,"pin-chien chao, ling-chen wu and wen-fang wu institute of industrial engineering national taiwan university taipei, taiwan r10546042@ntu.edu.tw; jane85918@gmail.com; wfwu@ntu.edu.tw",
171,State-Of-Health Prediction And Reliability Analysis  Of Li-Ion Battery,"electric vehicles have become a trend in vehicle development in recent years due to their low noise, low pollution, and reusable batteries. however, the batteries of electric vehicles will gradually fade out with the number of charge- and-discharge cycles, and may cause fire or explosion hazards. battery life and reliability have thus become important research issues. among the commonly used batteries for electric vehicles, lithium-ion batteries are often used by electric vehicle manufacturers today because of their high-power storage, small size, and high energy density. the state-of-health (soh) is the most commonly used indicator for evaluating the fading degree of lithium-ion batteries. for the battery, its soh will gradually decrease with the number of charge-and-discharge cycles. when the average value of a battery system drops to be less than 80%, the vehicle manufacturer will advise the vehicle owner to replace the battery system to avoid inconveniences and potential hazards. in order to ensure the safety of battery cells used in electric vehicles, this study proposes a semi-empirical model to predict the soh of a battery based on its ambient temperature during battery operation, the number of charge-and-discharge cycles, the discharge rate, and the nominal capacity and specifically discusses the number of charge-and-discharge cycles experienced when soh is lower than 80%. the proposed model can be used as an evaluation tool to understand the degree of battery aging through quantitative reliability analysis, and explores how the uncertainty of coefficients in the semi-empirical model for understanding its impact on the prediction results. at the end of this study, through the analysis of different types of lithium-ion batteries, and assuming that the effects of the internal chemical reaction of the battery do not affect the prediction of soh during the charge-and-discharge cycle, the difference in the model's soh curve-fitting under different conditions are discussed in particular. different applications are also addressed. in this study, the number of charge-and-discharge cycles predicted by the semi-empirical model can be used to estimate the degree of battery aging, and the reliability analysis can be used to evaluate the battery usage, so that it can determine whether the battery needs to be replaced, and can minimize the probability of occurrence of hazards.","electric vehicle, state of health",,"yu-chen hsu institute of industrial engineering national taiwan university taipei, taiwan r11546011@ntu.edu.tw ming-hui ou and pin-chen wang department of mechanical engineering national taiwan university taipei, taiwan a0981939473@yahoo.com.tw; r10522541@ntu.edu.tw wen-fang wu department of mechanical engineering and institute of industrial engineering national taiwan university taipei, taiwan wfwu@ntu.edu.tw",
172,Laser Cutting Time Estimate For Sheet Metal Parts Of  Various Geometries By,"manufacturing sheet metal parts with laser cutting machines involves placing several parts of various geometries from multiple customers on one sheet blank (e.g., 6’ x 12’). while this practice is common, it can cause complications in accurately calculating fabrication time and subsequent cost of parts for each customer. the reason for this is that laser cutting machines display only the total cutting time per entire sheet blank, and the cutting order within and between parts on sheet blanks may not be sequential. to resolve this long-standing machine time distribution problem, this paper proposes a machine learning approach based on the geometric characteristics of parts. to test this approach, 348 sheet blanks with parts of various shapes and sizes were processed on a laser cut machine to collect the machine's cutting time for each sheet blank. the parts on the sheet blank were broken down into their component geometric characteristics (e.g., line length, number of vertices, arc length, number of piercing, etc.), which were used as features for the machine learning model. data from 338 sheet blanks were used for training, and data from the remaining 10 were used to validate the trained model. three machine learning algorithms—linear regression, ridge regression, and lasso regression—were selected and compared. the results show that the machine learning approach, based on parts' geometric characteristics, is a viable method for designating cutting time for parts on sheet blanks. with the real-time data collection of parts' geometry and shop floor machine run time in the era of industry 4.0, this approach can be implemented on any laser cut machines to automatically determine the cutting time (and therefore manufacturing cost) of each part.","machine learning, automation","A new approach is proposed to distribute the machine run time of a sheet blank to each part on the sheet blank for all laser cut machines. It adopts Machine Learning method and is based on parts’ geometric characteristics and associated laser cutting actions. Through the training of Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, and Lasso Regression models, 338 training sheet blanks were executed with 93% to 95% accuracy result using 5-fold cross validation procedure, and 10 test sheet blanks with 91% to 92% accuracy result. Machine run time for the 27 parts on 10 test sheet blanks were accordingly assigned and verified. Additional geometric characteristics can be included for a broader geometry of sheet metal parts if needed. Our results demonstrate that the proposed approach is viable to provide precise and consistent machine run time (hence manufacturing cost) for parts of various geometries on a sheet blank. It can replace the subjective estimation currently used in industry, and can be automated with real-time data collection in the era of Industry 4.0. The approach can be expanded to incorporate manufacturing features of turret punch machines to develop a more comprehensive and versatile model.

More practically, the paper conceptualises an improvement by applying the proposed framework. The results of this research have suggested alternative methods for improving marketing and supply chain collaboration, specifically within retailing. In light of the contribution, there is considerable research for future exploration, we recommend as follows. • The research outlines the framework and performance metrics that enhance operations planning towards retail applications. We used a case study to identify key considerations, operational activities, and capabilities towards implementations. Furthermore, we would suggest the proposed framework to be carried out in a dedicated time frame in order to properly identify the significance. • The current research only involved one case study company. While it is also foreseeable to use the current methods, further examinations could involve more case study participants to validate the usefulness of marketing and supply chain collaboration. We would further conceptualise a thorough outcome when added participants are included within the research. • The current research only considers internal factors, such as company compatibility in implementing the proposed framework. Hence, we would also consider external factors within execution in order to precisely determine the impacts of marketing-supply chain collaboration. The consideration of external and internal factors may provide companies with a dynamic view of the current environment, hence translates to better execution of the proposed collaborative framework.","a retail industry case study marcell eng djaja1,2 and xue-ming yuan1 1singapore institute of manufacturing technology agency for science, technology and research (a*star) singapore 138634, singapore and 2logistics and supply chain management university of warwick marcelldjaja7@gmail.com; xmyuan@simtech.a-star.edu.sg",

179,A Sustainable Supplier Selection Adapting Triple Bottom  Line Framework For The Construction Industry Using,"nowadays, the call to go green is getting stronger than ever. numerous environmental issues are constantly arising, leading to various laws and regulations to address the problem. companies and organizations are trying to integrate sustainability into their business processes. the construction industry, one of the largest industries, also encounters the same scenario. this study aims to bridge the gap between sustainability and the construction industry by developing a sustainable supplier selection tool. the researchers chose the country of the philippines as the location. sustainability is incorporated using the triple bottom-line framework. the triple-bottom-line framework consists of environmental, economic, and social dimensions. this framework allows a holistic view of the necessary things for prioritization and not on profitability alone. existing literature and studies were found to determine the sub-criteria for each of the three dimensions. the economic dimension garnered a total of 15 sub-criteria, the social dimension has a total of 10 sub- criteria, and 12 sub-criteria were determined for the environmental dimension, which sums up to 37 sub-criteria. a total of 100 respondents have participated with online survey questionnaires. using factor analysis, the researchers were able to compress the 37 sub-criteria into eight sub-criteria: four sub-criteria under economic criterion, two sub- criteria under social criterion, and two sub-criteria under environmental criterion. moreover, analytical hierarchy process (ahp), a multi-criteria decision-making (mcdm) tool, was employed to determine the relative weights, which corresponds to importance, of each sub-criterion. at the end, the researchers were able to develop a tool using excel visual basic application to determine the best sustainable supplier given the set of criteria.","supplier selection, triple bottom line","The proponents used existing literatures and studies to determine different sub-criteria for each of the triple bottom line framework. 15 sub-criteria were found for the economic criterion, 10 sub-criteria for social criterion, and 12 sub- criteria for environmental criterion. Upon determining the sub-criteria, the data-gathering procedure was employed then factor analysis was utilized to determine the significant and insignificant criteria and sub-criteria and reduce the large number of variables into fewer number. The result of the hypothesis testing states that all main criteria and its sub-criteria have a significant impact on sustainable supplier selection in the Philippine construction industry. The environmental factor was reduced from 15 sub-criteria to four sub-criteria: S.A.F.E, Organizational Stability, Competitive Dimension, and Affordability and Technological Capability. The social factor was reduced from 10 sub- criteria to two sub-criteria: Employee Management, Safety and Health, and Adherence to Rights and Policy. Finally, the environmental factor was reduced from 12 sub-criteria to two sub-criteria: Green Innovation Practices and Environmental Corporate Social Responsibility. The proponents determined the relative weight of importance of the criteria and the synthesized sub-criteria through Analytical Hierarchy Process. The researchers developed a sustainable supplier selection tool using Excel VBA to aid procurement decision-makers in assessing the suppliers standing and addressing the growing negative impact of the construction industry on the economy, society, and the environment. In conclusion, the criteria and sub-criteria will serve as a guide in ensuring that the chosen supplier will benefit the company most, not solely by profit but also by social and environmental aspects. 1440","multi-criteria decision-making aubrey a. angeles, aprile c. ilano, darwyn p. ong, vince b. reoyan and gabriel c. bucu department of industrial engineering, university of santo tomas, españa boulevard, sampaloc, manila, 1008, philippines aubrey.angeles.eng@ust.edu.ph, aprile.ilano.eng@ust.edu.ph, darwyn.ong.eng@ust.edu.ph, vincenimrod.reoyan.eng@ust.edu.ph, gcbucu@ust.edu.ph","References

182,Assessment Framework For Consumer Purchase Decision  In Supermarket,"in recent times the community is facing an alarming threat from the repeated pandemic, which has changed our lifestyle in many ways. this study assesses the fact that how the mind set of customers buying decisions in supermarkets for their day-to-day consumables and essential products have changed because of this pandemic. this change in behavior is found by identifying some factors that are related to the consumers buying behavior in supermarkets and then deeply related to the pandemic. the aim of this paper is to develop assessment framework for consumer purchase decision in supermarkets using multi-grade fuzzy approach. the framework is developed using four enablers, twelve criteria and twenty-four attributes. important performance analysis (ipa) is conducted to find the gaps where the case-supermarket lagged which in turn could attract the customers to increase foot traffic and sales.","supermarket, multi-grade fuzzy","Based on the study conducted in the customers buying or purchasing behavior. The study found that there were some attributes involved which played a prominent role in the supermarket characteristics. In this study identified were four enablers, which involves customers buying decisions in the supermarkets. Based on those enablers there were several criteria and attributes that relate to the customers buying decision in supermarkets. Multi-grade fuzzy was used as a methodology to develop this assessment framework. Then the attributes are classified based on its importance and weightages with the help of Importance Performance Analysis. The weaker attributes are identified from IPA, and also identified the key attributes where they are doing good. Hence, from this study it is clear that how customers buying decisions vary accordingly, also the places and perspectives where the supermarkets should fill the missing gaps to make more foot traffic in their stores and increase sales. Thus, the study has proven that how this pandemic has affected the customer buying decisions.","e.aloysius richard rozario and m. suresh amrita school of business, amrita vishwa vidyapeetham, coimbatore, india richardee39@gmail.com, m_suresh@cb.amrita.edu",
183,Factors Influencing Msmes Performance  B.U. Sivakami  And M. Suresh,"this research's goal is to list and rate the variables that affect how well micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (msme) function. the total interpretive structural modeling (tism) technique determines the interconnectedness, relative importance, and relationships between various components. analysing these factors' dependencies and driving forces is another key component of the work. the findings revealed that organisational reform, entrepreneurial spirit, and government backing are the key motivators. msmes should concentrate on these elements to enhance their performance. additionally, by reforming msmes' businesses, this strategy will increase their profitability and resilience.","msme, tism, msmes performance","This study identified the influencing factors by using TISM approach to implement survival strategies for the MSMEs performance. The key important factors identified are Government support, entrepreneurial spirit, and organizational change. The main key factor is government support which has an impact on the factors like entrepreneurial spirit, innovativeness and technology. Entrepreneurial spirit will decide the internal environment of the MSME and also adds up to innovativeness. Organizations attitude to change its practices, strategies etc influences the spirit of the entrepreneurs. Innovativeness influences the technology adopted by the MSME’s and also enhances the marketing opportunities of the business. On the other hand, technology influences innovativeness and the ability to meet customer needs. There is limitation in the present study. Firstly, the expert opinions are confined to one country. Second, survey is used to develop a theoretical model, which is based on the expert opinions. In such a case it is not possible to avoid the biasness from experts.","amrita school of business, amrita vishwa vidyapeetham, coimbatore, india sivikoushika@gmail.com, m_suresh@cb.amrita.edu",

It means it has a category of 'Good'. According to the respondents, the variable with the highest score is the variable credibility, with a value of 79.7%. This shows that respondents consider the information provided by Telkomsel Halo on Instagram to be trusted. The influence of each Quality of Social Media Marketing sub-variable, namely Entertainment, Interaction, Trendiness, Customization, and e-WOM on Customer Inspiration has positive and significant results. The results of tests conducted to determine the indirect effect of social media marketing variables on purchase intention show that it has a positive and significant influence. The findings in this study are expected to help the Telkomsel Halo brand understand the consumer's perspective. Suggestions are aimed at variable indicators that can be improved to improve consumer perceptions and impressions of Telkomsel Halo marketing. Based on t-values and p-values, Customer Inspiration was the most influential factor in the Purchase Intention of Prepaid users who own and have seen Telkomsel Halo content on Instagram. The descriptive statistical analysis found that item CI17, ""After seeing content on Telkomsel Halo social media (Instagram), I am motivated to buy more Halo products/services,"" got the lowest percentage score, namely 73.8%. From these findings, the authors suggest that Telkomsel Halo to increase consumer inspiration so they can be more interested in products or services from Telkomsel Halo. This can be done by providing various information on the benefits consumers will get if they use Telkomsel Halo and what more value consumers will feel and receive. Telkomsel can also collaborate with certain parties to educate consumers and increase customer inspiration. The content can be in the form of product/service reviews by influencers or KOLs who are experts in that field so that consumers can be more trusting and interested in the content provided. The object of this research is Instagram with the Telkomsel Halo case study in the telecommunications Industry, so the study's results cannot be generalized to other social media platforms and other business industries. The author suggests further research to learn more about this social media marketing topic on other social media platforms and other business sectors or even conduct comparative research between several social media platforms. It is expected to be able to conduct research by adding indicators and or variables that have not been included in this research model. Thus, a new research model will be formed which is expected to be more perfect than previous studies.","purchase intention through customer inspiration (study on telkomsel postpaid in java, indonesia) indrawati a associate professor in marketing faculty of economy & business telkom university bandung, indonesia indrawati@telkomuniversity.ac.id zenia rahmah a associate professor of marketing & consumer studies faculty of economy & business telkom university bandung, indonesia zeniarhmh@student.telkomuniversity.ac.id",

This research paper has applied the ISM approach to identify the factors and the developed model leads to the successful analysis of factors that influences in the electricity distribution sector. The factors consumption charges perspective and electrical subsidiary industries play a significant role in the electricity distribution. The key factors that are identified from this study supports the DISCOMs for the effective distribution of power. This study would assist in identify dependent, independent, linkage and driving factors that influences electricity distribution. The demand fluctuations, personal protection, uninterrupted distribution, location, construction activities, consumption charges perspective, and electrical subsidiary industries are the key factors that are more important for influencing the electricity distribution. Sector-wise distribution and manpower has more significant dependence factors involved in this study. This is because the changes in any of the other factors shows noticeable changes in the manpower and sector wise distribution. Also factors like usage of renewable sources, payment policy, staff salary and operating costs are autonomous factors. Extension of this study can deal with more specific regions so that challenges can be further reduced in future research.

187,Valuation Of Mini Hydropower Plant In Indonesia By  Considering The Effect Of Risk Factors Using,"energy plays a crucial role in developing a country and defining its’ living standards though many still use non- renewable energy with high greenhouse gas emissions. hence, there needs to be a change to new and renewable energy usage. in indonesia, hydropower has huge potential as new and renewable energy. the government's support also follows in realizing potential. however, risks and uncertainties are involved when investing in new and renewable energy projects, particularly hydropower plants. therefore, it’s crucial to calculate the value of a project while considering the risks involved in the valuation model. the value at risk approach using discounted cash flow and monte carlo simulation is viable for calculating the value while accounting for risk. this study aims to discover the value of a mini hydropower plant facility while accounting for risks and uncertainties by discovering the value at risk with a 95% confidence level tested through two different scenarios. the results show that the value decreases when faced with risks at a determined confidence level. it also shows the most significant risk affecting the valuation is the water flow rate in the facility's production. additionally, the significance of the risk and uncertainty factors can increase through different scenarios.","hydropower, valuation, risk","and Recommendation After conducting this research, the risk factors in the valuation of mini hydropower plants can be categorized into financial (O&M Cost) and production (Water Flow Rate) risks. The mini hydropower plant's base valuation using the Discounted Cash Flow method is Rp 27.242.932.483 and affected by risk the valuation is Rp 21.467.805.114, 21,20% lower in value on normal conditions, and Rp 18.193.287.260, 33,22% lower in value on adjusted inflation condition. The Water Flow Rate (Q) is the most significant risk factor in both scenarios. Lastly, faced with the risk factors, the valuation of the mini hydropower plant is lower than the base value, with a 95% confidence level on any scenario simulated in this research. After conducting this research, the recommendation from the author includes more in-depth research using Value at Risk methodology on other mini hydropower plant facility to discover the potential loss in value when faced with risk factors.

188,Towards A Better Understanding Of Quality 4.0  Lahmine Souad,"industry 4.0(i4.0) or the fourth industrial revolution is a strategy that relies on digital and ubiquitous connectivity enabled by various technologies to transform processes, products, and services through real-time and decentralized decision-making, allowing systems to transition from surveillance to autonomy in collaboration with humans. resulting in the emergence of 'industry 4.0' the term '4.0' has been applied to a variety of fields, including quality 4.0, agriculture 4.0, agribusiness 4.0, service 4.0, logistics 4.0, health 4.0, and so on, all of which represent the impact of industry 4.0 on these terms. quality 4.0(q 4.0) is a new term that refers to a new and improved approach to quality management, it how we can use the data obtained by 4.0 and use it correctly with the quality methodology, the objective of this paper is to explain industry 4.0 as well as quality 4.0 and presented the various quality 4.0 relationships.","quality 4.0, industry 4.0, quality management, data","In this study we start to give the different definition of quality 4.0 and it’s suggesting that 'Quality 4.0' is a new quality management trend. As a result, both theoretical and practical aspects of quality management practices will be altered in the future. Quality management practices are recommended to identify technological advancement as a key enabler of successful quality standard implementation in the Quality 4.0 era. According to the literature review, the most common Quality 4.0 topics are technology and its implications for quality, business management and strategy models, systems, and human or soft factors. The use of technology for quality management is represented in a variety of information sources, and it appears to be the most direct way to connect quality to technology. The majority of products, services, and operations can now be controlled automatically across the value chain thanks to intelligent machines and armed operators equipped with augmented reality technologies. The paper concluded that big data is so important for deep learning techniques, connectivity, collaboration, and data presentation are the main Quality 4.0 technologies. Therefore, to give a more in-depth view of quality 4.0, we have prepared a questionnaire that we will publish to have a clear view of the industry and quality 4.0","industrial engineer souad.lahmine@usmba.ac.ma fatima bennouna professor of industrial engineering bennouna.ensa@gmail.com innovative technologies laboratory, ensa, smba university, fez, morocco",

An LSTM-based RNN Model was also designed and developed with the proper specifications. It was trained using the dataset created with various optimizers and epoch values. The multiple models were evaluated using the mean squared error loss function wherein the model with the lowest loss value was chosen for the final model. With its low loss value and perplexity score, the model was ready to create music samples. The music samples were then subjected to a listening test where the results showed that in terms of tonality, rhythm, form, and melody, they had a rating from 3.7 - 4.3 in the 5-point scale, which are interpreted as having a good rating. Lastly, a web application was also developed to make accessing the model much more convenient. These were all accomplished using the programming language Python, with the help of external libraries such as tensorflow, prettymidi, etc. With the accomplishments written above, all the objectives have been met. This study has filled in the gap, being the lack of pop music research in deep learning.","don vincent goodrich s. ignacio and hans y. sicangco college of computer studies angeles university foundation angeles city, philippines ignacio.donvincentgoodrich@auf.edu.ph, sicangco.hans@auf.edu.ph dr. james a. esquivel college of computer studies, faculty angeles university foundation angeles city, philippines esquivel.james@auf.edu.ph",
191,An Agent-Based Modeling Approach For Effective  Innovation Ecosystem Orchestration,"innovation ecosystems are classified as one of the complex economic systems where many parties with different interests are involved. the holistic objective of such alignment of entities is to cooperate in the creation of innovative outputs. the innovation ecosystem provides the environment for large corporates, entrepreneurs, investors, and governmental institutions to accumulate their sole offering into value capturing via networking and exchanging knowledge and expertise. thus, such kind of ecosystem exhibits multiple partnerships and interactions among actors to fulfill their own needs and contribute to the value co-creation process. this paper explores the nature of innovation ecosystem as a set of networks comprising a large spectrum of agents interacting with each other. most of the previous work on ecosystems has pursued qualitative studies emphasizing on how to orchestrate an innovation ecosystem entirely. however, we addressed such a phenomenon by means of an agent-based modeling considering both the micro level of the system which consists of the individual agents and the macro level which is represented by the aggregating of individuals’ behaviors. the model can be used as a decision-making tool to examine the validity of an orchestrating strategy by detecting its dual impact on individual agents and on the overall performance of the ecosystem.","orchestration, decision-analysis","This paper aimed to explain the phenomenon of establishing innovation ecosystem and proposed a new approach to tackle the complexity associated with orchestrating such systems. The nature of innovation ecosystem was addressed by developing An Agent-based modeling simulation. The calibrated simulation model can serve as a what-if analysis tool that policymakers may use to evaluate and confirm their strategic recommendations without having to carry out a real experiment. Therefore, our future work will mainly concentrate on adopting real data in the model for the purposes of calibrating the model and ensuring its functionality.

Its closeness to the modern manufacturing systems is the reason for its wide attention from the academia and industries. Nowadays, consideration of real life issues of the scheduling problems have been started to develop the solution approach which can target and solve the actual and complex scheduling problems. For real scheduling problems, factors such as maintenance, setup and transportation times are generally assumed. But, existing research papers have majorly counted these factors individually for the FJSP. The proposed work has considered these issues: maintenance planning, setup and transportation times simultaneously and termed it as complex FJSP. For the solution, a multi agent based approach is proposed. An example of 4x5 problem instance is solved and illustrated in detailed. For the experimental comparison, three problems 4x5, 8x8 and 10x10 are solve solved and compared. The proposed approach is the first approach to be developed for the FJSP with three factors so it has been compared with FJSP with individual factors. The comparison has proved the effectiveness of the solution approach. The Gantt chart with optimal solution for 4x5 problem is demonstrated. In future, the proposed approach is going to be further improved with hybrid algorithms and by solving more number of problems.","manojkumar pal, murari lal mittal, gunjan soni department of mechanical engineering malaviya national institute of technology (mnit), jaipur, india 2017rme9086@mnit.ac.in, mlmittal.mech@mnit.ac.in, gunjansoni.mech@mnit.ac.in",

199,A Predictive Model On A Consumer’S Impulsive Buying  Intention Towards Facebook Live Online Selling Using,"during the covid-19 crisis, the digital economy expanded. due to covid-19 restrictions, people have become more reliant on online buying. many businesses shifted their approach to online platforms, thus engaging more customers. the live-stream shopping campaign in the philippines is continuously growing due to more social media interaction with consumers. small independent merchants have shifted to facebook live selling, which shows real-time video, as a direct selling technique. this study examined the factors influencing impulse buying behavior amongst consumers in facebook live selling. three hundred eighty-four (386) respondents, ages 18 to 55 participated in the online survey that consisted of their demographics and questions based on the internal and external factors affecting the impulsiveness of a consumer towards buying in facebook live-selling. the study used binary logistic regression to predict whether an individual will purchase an item on impulse in facebook live-selling. the dependent variable was categorized by the individual’s intention towards the product, it was denoted as (0 = will not buy; 1 = will buy). the model revealed that among the factors, only sex (ρ = 0.049), frequency of purchase (ρ = 0.00), impulse buying tendency (ρ = 0.00), and trust propensity (ρ = 0.035) are significant predictor variables in the model, which were only internal factors. overall, the model helps broaden our understanding of how the latest marketing strategy (live selling) affects the impulse buying behavior of consumers. limitations and implications are further discussed in the study.","impulse buying, online shopping","While the market for Live-selling grows, companies have been using live-streaming as a new economic strategy that integrates specialized activities with videos for its unique content presentation and high-level involvement (Zhang et al. 2022). Live streaming has been able to garner billions in revenue, leading it to be welcomed into the global spotlight as a source of profitability. Live streaming enables anyone to have access to information, interact with hosts live, and show their content from a remote location. In this study, various factors were considered relating to the impulse buying behavior of consumers in an online live selling set up. By using descriptive statistics, the proponents found out that only four factors significantly affect the impulse buying behavior of the consumers. This result is consistent with prior studies on how sex, purchase frequency, impulse buying tendency, and trust propensity correlates to online impulse buying. The Binary Logistic Regression Model was used to predict whether the consumers will purchase on impulse or not based on the significant factors found in the study. The model may be very beneficial to consumers who want to limit their unnecessary online purchases. The study enriches our understanding of the rising development of selling in a social commerce context. However, the study revealed that there is no significant relationship between the live streaming features and the impulsive buying behavior of consumers. Further study is needed to effectively grasp and utilize the live streaming features in the Philippines since it is a relatively new instrument that is still under development. This study can further explore the different factors that could be involved in the use of other live-streaming platforms aside from Facebook.","binary logistic regression assoc. prof. carolos ignacio jr. p. lugay, phd, pie, asean engr. kian justin o. angeles, karl g. espina bianca dp. lipata and jan cedrick v. sta. cruz faculty of engineering university of santo tomas manila, philippines cplugay@ust.edu.ph, kianjustin.angeles.eng@ust.edu.ph, karl.espina.eng@ust.edu.ph, bianca.lipata.eng@ust.edu.ph, jancedrick.stacruz.eng@ust.edu.ph",

As a result, transportation waste is at a high level. The indirect factor is work accidents related to manual lifting, which lead to poor work efficiency. After the process improvement, the work efficiency increased by 175.82%, and the work injuries rate was reduced to zero. The new work standard applies to the work process. Each member of staff must wear safety devices. Goods moving should only be done by an energy-saving machine. Manual lifting is prohibited. The budget for improving the process line and working standard on a two-people basis is 57,500 Thai Baht.

204,Streamlining Data Preparation For Discrete Event  Simulations In Automobile Manufacturing:,"discrete event simulations are becoming increasingly important in the management of complex manufacturing systems, however, a significant issue with current methods is the collection and processing of data from various physical systems. this data is often of poor quality and incomplete, making it difficult to produce accurate results. to address this problem, a python-based automation tool was created to collect, analyse, and store data from manufacturing execution systems (mes) using a multi-step data preparation algorithm and a dedicated simulation database. this tool is more efficient than using tools such as microsoft excel and includes a user-friendly interface for data entry and visualization. this automation tool is expected to improve the quality and accuracy of simulation results, while reducing the time and effort required for data preparation in the automobile manufacturing production line.","data preparation, data processing","We created an automation tool for IDM in DES that is based on Python which has a User Interface for data entry as well as a separate database for holding output files from the tool and the simulation software. Thereby establishing a workspace for simulation engineers that includes complete automation of the generation of input data for throughput simulation and the provision of data analysis visualizations with a single database housing all of their project-related documents. This tool significantly shortens the deadlines for simulation projects by giving useful input data in a matter of minutes, even when the tool is used for hundreds of Assets. In contrast, the Excel-based Macro tool generates the output over the course of hours or even days, and it occasionally gets stuck. The results demonstrate that the Python IDM tool is significantly more effective at delivering precise output rapidly. The newly created cleaning algorithm is exclusive and solely applicable to the data creation for throughput simulation. Depending on the sort of simulation input data required and the type of data given for cleaning, this task can be expanded by altering the cleaning algorithm, as a future direction of research.","a python-based automation tool i. saran kumar student, department of mechanical engineering national institute of technology calicut, india ika_m210541me@nitc.ac.in v. madhusudanan pillai professor, department of mechanical engineering national institute of technology calicut, india vmp@nitc.ac.in",
205,Comparative Analysis Of The Mechanical Properties Of  Coconut Fiber Cement Board And Concrete Hollow Blocks,"in order to determine if the cfb panel is superior to the chb, this study, ""comparative study of the mechanical properties of coconut fiber cement board and concrete hollow blocks,"" compared the two products' prices, dead loads, and compressive strengths. three samples of each of the two products were used in the experiment, which the researchers conducted. the tensile strength test, parametric test, and universal testing machine (utm) were used to gather the data for this study. the compressive strength test was performed at the terms concrete and materials testing laboratories inc. in tayuman, manila. the study assumed that: cfbs are less expensive than chbs; carry less weight than chbs; and have greater structural strength. results show that cfb has an average compressive strength of 1,004.167 psi. in comparison to a chb, the cfb has more compressive strength. the researchers also concluded that a cfb would carry less weight than a chb at 5.4721 lb. in both panels' cost analyses, the price of cfb is deemed to be higher than the price of chb. fiber cement board (cfb) offers a substantially more cost-effective alternative. by enhancing the walling system for residential establishment, this study will benefit the philippine construction industry.","chb, cfb","A material or structural element's capacity to withstand loads that, when applied, cause them to reduce in size is referred to as their compressive strength. The researchers have determined that the average compressive strength of the Coconut Fiber Cement Board is 1207 PSI with 28 days curing period. The Coconut Fiber Cement Board has satisfied the average necessary compressive strength in accordance with ASTM C90 with 28 days of curing period. The findings clearly showed that the Coconut Fiber Cement Board has a higher compressive strength than a Concrete Hollow Block. In the average Dead Load of both CHB and CFB, the proponents of the study concluded that the weight of CFB would be 3.2 lb, which means that it is lighter than the concrete hollow block. This means that the carrying weight of CFB is lower than the concrete hollow blocks without the poured mixture inside. In the cost-analysis of both panels, the price of CFB is evaluated to be higher than the cost of CHB. One of the main reasons for this is the addition of the Fiber Cement Board as the base of the CFB and the additional aggregate of Coconut Fiber Husk. Economically speaking, with regard to the price, the CHB is definitely better than the CFB but according to a Solutions Built article, Permanent Formwork Panel offers additional stability and shields concrete from deterioration despite the CFB's somewhat higher cost. It is also claimed that using permanent formworks allows for quick turnaround, lower prices, and a reduction in time and procedure needed for building commercial or residential structures. Based on the data results, CHB has a compressive strength of 801 PSI while CFB has 1207 PSI. As of the dead load, CHB has a dead load of 18.2 lb while CFB has 3.2 lb. Furthermore, the cost in creating 3 pcs of concrete hollow blocks would be ₱1005.00. In addition, the cost of producing 3 coconut fiber cement boards would be ₱1,435.00. However, despite its slightly higher cost, the Permanent Formwork Panel which is the same concept as our CFB provides additional stability and protects concrete from deterioration, according to a Solutions Built article. Permanent formwork also allows for a faster turnaround, lower costs, and a reduction in the time and procedures required for building commercial or residential structures.","prof. carlos ignacio jr. p. lugay, phd, pie, asean eng professor of industrial engineering faculty of engineering,university of santo tomas manila, philippines cplugay@ust.edu.ph dyanne trixzel suacoco, mark levinson go, kyle matthew espiritu, and marc neilsen elamparo roque ruano, faculty of engineering, industrial engineering university of santo tomas manila, philippines dyannetrixzel.suacoco.eng@ust.edu.ph, marklevinson.go.eng@ust.edu.ph kylematthew.espiritu.eng@ust.edu.ph marcneilsen.elamparo.eng@ust.edu.ph",

The study found that such welding variables affected the melting and metallurgical transfer between the welding wire and the workpiece due to the appropriate arcing of the test piece and the optimum melting rate of the wire. From the tensile test, it was found that most of the test pieces broke down at the welding line at 80 A current. Therefore, the welding current at 80 A was not suitable for use. On the other hand, because the welding wire's melting rate is inadequate, the welding's penetration is less. Furthermore, at arc currents of 100 A and 120 A, the test piece's tear marks are on the side of SS400 steel, making it suitable for use. 100 150 200 250 300 350 BA S E S S 400 H A Z (S S 400) W E LD H A Z (1. 4003) BA S E 1. 4003 HARDNESS (HV) AREA ER70-150-80 ER70-150-100 ER70-150-120 ER70-210-80 ER70-210-100 ER70-210-120 ER308-150-80 ER308-150-100 ER308-150-120 ER308-210-80 ER308-210-100 ER308-210-120 1688","carbon steel ss400 chonlakorn onma, jongkol srithorn school of industrial engineering suranaree university of technology nakhon ratchasima 30000 thailand m6401160@g.sut.ac.th, jongkol@sut.ac.th","References

Traditional Face-To-Face Methods:,"the recent global pandemic and the academic efforts, nationally and internationally, to minimize teaching and learning interruption due to this unexpected phenomenon provided educators an opportunity to explore alternative teaching and learning methods. several online communication mediums saw opportunities to explore these needs and stimulate the innovative use of these technologies. the engineering education community was among the groups who cautiously led this transformation. over the past twenty years, the texas a&m university-qatar campus has established itself as one of the leading academic institutions in the region. the education city in doha, qatar, houses six american university branches, among which texas a&m university-qatar is the only one that offers four abet-accredited engineering degrees in chemical, electrical, mechanical, and petroleum. texas a&m university-qatar campus has consistently been regarded as an institution that often takes the lead in developing, implementing, and assessing the most innovative use of innovative teaching and learning methods to engage students in learning further actively. this paper reports some of the results of an empirical study conducted at texas a&m university in qatar and texas a&m university in college station, texas, in two undergraduate courses taught on these two campuses. this study also compared students' academic performance in synchronous learning environments with face-to-face teaching and learning options.",delivery methods,The responses provided by undergraduate students from both campuses showed several similarities. The knowledge of information technology (IT) plays a key role in synchronous learning. The availability of high-speed internet affected how students participated in the classes and collaborated with their peers. The survey identified that class participation affected the academic performance of the student. It is also pertinent that access to course instructors and face-to-face instructions were preferred as both of them could speed up the learning process. The availability of the course materials should be continued during face-to-face learning and not limited only to online courses. The survey results also showed that students for the classes with laboratory components were less respective to remote learning (synchronous). The main disadvantage for engineering students in remote learning is the ability to perform hands-on experimental work and do research. The academic performance appeared better during traditional face-to- face.,"an empirical study albertus retnanto, ph.d. professor, petroleum engineering texas a&m university at qatar doha, qatar albertus.retnanto@qatar.tamu.edu hamid r. parsaei, ph.d., p.e. professor, industrial and systems engineering texas a&m university college station, tx, usa hamid.parsaei@tamu.edu boback parsaei vice president and chief technical officer integrated technology systems, inc. houston, texas, usa bobackparsaei@outlook.com",
211,Stacking Activity Modeling In Tanjung Priok Container  Terminal Using Discrete Event Simulation,"tanjung priok port and international trade are two things that cannot be separated. however, the performance of the tanjung priok container terminal is currently not optimal even though tanjung priok is the main port lever in indonesia in terms of exports to foreign countries. as a result, increasing the productivity of container ports in serving container traffic flows is essential. in order to improve container terminal productivity, this study will create a model and simulation of container stacking in the stacking yard (stacking area). a proper stacking procedure (stacking rules) will limit the amount of reshuffling, which is a waste in container operations. the study's findings are discrete event simulation-based models that may be used to evaluate container stacking options based on container terminal productivity. as a result, it is planned to provide an understanding of the relationship between productivity and container stacking procedures in stacking yards.","stacking rules, stacking yard, reshuffling, port productivity",Researchers were successful in developing a discrete-event simulation-based container terminal model that represents the activity of loading and export containers from the time the container enters the container terminal to the time the container is transported on board. 1747,"armand omar moeis, irfan rolanda adfikaputra, and andri dwi setiawan department of industrial engineering, faculty of engineering, universitas indonesia depok, 16424, indonesia armand.omar@ui.ac.id, irfan.rolanda@ui.ac.id, a.d.setiawan@ui.ac.id","References

216,Evaluation Of Circadian Rhythmic Activity Cycle In Line  With Academic Activities Among Engineering Students,"the circadian rhythm cycle has a significant impact on students who attend their daily classes at home or online. as students adjust to the new system, sleep deprivation is one of the most significant factors affecting their daily schedules. this study aimed to investigate the impact of the circadian rhythm cycle on engineering students who attend classes at home or online. the researchers used structural equation modeling to analyze relationships between variables such as sleep, grades, workload, and stress levels. the results showed that factors such as academic workload, fatigue, academic stress, screen time, and the number of units had a significant effect on the sleep-wake activity of engineering students. additionally, academic stress was found to be a contributing factor to psychological well-being, while screen time and hours of sleep were found to be contributing factors to working conditions and individual factors, respectively. to address these issues, the researchers recommend giving students sufficient deadlines for online activities, implementing a system of monitored class length and interval, and providing quick breaks. they also suggest that counseling and medical consultation should be made accessible to students to create a more open environment for discussing mental health and well-being.","circadian rhythm, sleep-wake, body clock","Academic activities can impact the circadian rhythm cycle of engineering students studying in NCR, according to the accepted assumptions (H5, H6, H7, H9, H11, H12, H14, H15, H16, H17 and H18). Even yet, there are still gaps in the study that prevent the researchers from conclusively stating whether or not the circadian rhythm is disturbed. As there isn't enough data to fully establish the circadian rhythm, the researchers then offered several recommendations for future research to improve the study. Additionally, this research will assist students in improving their body clocks and sleep-wake cycles so they can enhance their well-being without compromising the subjects’ academic performance. Faculty members and/or professors in schools who are responsible for implementing the curriculum will also become more informed as a result of this study, enabling them to give their students an appropriate workload and class schedule.","studying in ncr during an online setup assoc. prof. carlos ignacio p. lugay jr., ph.d., pie, asean eng professor of industrial engineering associate professor of the industrial engineering department faculty of engineering university of santo tomas españa blvd, 1015, manila, philippines cplugay@ust.edu.ph rich anne d. dela cruz, erika anne c. maaño, vhyns erlic v. mahaguay, jan w. sta. ana department of industrial engineering university of santo tomas españa blvd, 1015, manila, philippines richanne.delacruz.eng@ust.edu.ph, erikaanne.maano.eng@ust.edu.ph, vhynserlic.mahaguay.eng@ust.edu.ph, janjoseph.staana.eng@ust.edu.ph",

218,Establishing A Predictive Model On   Internet Service Provider Preference Of Work-From-Home,"according to the department of information and communications technology, the internet in the philippines needs continuous improvement. the statista research department labeled the philippines as one of the worst internet speeds with high costs in the asia pacific. the covid-19 pandemic forced businesses to implement a work-from-home (wfh) setup where high-performance broadband services are required. therefore, findings of this study will be beneficial to them since the aim of the study is to assess the satisfaction of wfh employees with their current internet service provider (isp) through the five factors - speed, cost, accessibility, reliability, and customer service. multinomial logistic regression was used to predict which isp (isp x, isp y, and isp z) is most likely used by wfh employees based on the satisfaction of the respondents. the results of the study showed that speed and cost are the only significant factors. a wfh employee who uses an isp with higher speed and cost is most likely to be a isp y user. these results imply that there is a high demand for fast and affordable internet in the philippines. the researchers recommend using a wider sample of internet users and isps, and utilizing different statistical tools for future studies.",,"can also be derived from the comparison of the cost for ISP X and ISP Y. Since the coefficient of column B for the cost of ISP Y is positive 0.467, the researchers can conclude that the higher the internet cost of the WFH employee, the more likely that he/she uses ISP Y. It can also be concluded that for every one unit increase in cost, the odds of being a ISP Y customer increase by 1.595 times. The lower part of Table 12 shows the comparison between ISP Y and ISP Z. Based on the significance levels, the speed and cost are also the only significant predictors in the model. Since the coefficient on column B for the speed of ISP Y is positive 0.053, the researchers can conclude that the higher the internet speed of the WFH employee, the more likely that he/she uses ISP Y. It can also be concluded that for every one unit increase in speed, the odds of being a ISP Y customer increase by 1.055 times. For the cost, since the coefficient of column B for the cost of ISP Y is positive 0.293, the researchers can conclude that the higher the internet cost of the WFH employee, the more likely that he/she uses ISP Y. It can also be concluded that for every one unit increase in cost, the odds of being a ISP Y customer increase by 1.34 times. As seen on Tables 11 and 12, speed is the only factor that is considered as statistically significant to compare ISP X and ISP Z using the model. In Table 11, the coefficient on column B for ISP Z is positive 0.117. The researchers can conclude that the higher the internet speed of the WFH employee, the more likely that he/she uses ISP Y. It can also be concluded that for every one unit increase in speed, the odds of being a ISP Z customer increase by 1.124 times. The classification statistics indicate the percentage of responses that the model was able to predict correctly. 69.6% or 16 out of 25 ISP X respondents were predicted by the model. ISP Y and ISP Z users were predicted by the model 50% of the time. As seen in Table 13, the overall percentage of 56.7% means that the model is able to correctly predict the ISP of the respondent more than half of the time. Table 13.

219,The Application Of Simulation Techniques To Enhance  Nitroglycerin Production Efficiency:,"this study's goals were to enhance nitroglycerin manufacturing efficiency through simulation, recover nitroglycerin from the storage facility, and enhance nitroglycerine recovery and purge systems. it was found that the problem was nitroglycerin reflux. therefore, the researcher created three alternatives to solve the problem. the system of nitroglycerine recovery and purge was then simulated using the flexsim program, and each alternative was tested. the results demonstrate that the alternative system-led nitroglycerine recovery and nitroglycerine purge system collaborate to produce nitroglycerine, which is more efficient than other alternatives and can reduce production time. it can also improve the recovery of nitroglycerin. it also serves as a guideline for developing a real-world system and modeling it for training staff without wasting chemical raw materials or fuel energy.",efficiency increase,"The study's findings are based on data from layouts, manuals, and factory plans owned by Nobel Explosives Company Limited as well as on interviews with knowledgeable employees who have been given technology by the company. The development of three alternatives to improve the efficiency of nitroglycerin production was also influenced by a comparison of the work process durations between the Nitroglycerine Recovery System and the Nitroglycerine Purge. The third alternative is to apply the Nitroglycerine Recovery System and the Nitroglycerine Purge System, the regeneration process of nitroglycerin decomposition is able to work continuously. It takes 16,020 seconds, 267 minutes, or 4 hours and 45 minutes, and it can choose to run either system. It is the most suitable choice. The application of simulation techniques to increase nitroglycerin production efficiency in a case study of a military explosives factory in Nakhon Sawan Province can be a practical and effective approach to system development. Nitroglycerine Recovery and Purge can be used successfully in practice. The technical data for this research is particular to nitroglycerin production plants, factory divisions, and military explosives factories, and only individuals working in the nitroglycerin production plant fully comprehend the working process. Those who are interested, however, can apply the concepts of the Nitroglycerine Recovery and Purge System to various operational applications. When designing a real system, it is advantageous to learn more about electrical and electronic control devices, performance display devices, and the system's control system in order to be consistent with the Nitroglycerine Recovery and Purge system and make the system more complete and safer for operators.","a case study of the military explosive factory in nakhon sawan province jeerasak wisatphan, nara samattapapong school of systems engineering, institute of engineering, suranaree university of technology, nakhon ratchasima, thailand. soundsungta@gmail.com ; nara@sut.ac.th",

223,Motorcyclist Driving Behavior Analysis  Mutia Irani,"driving behavior (db) is a complex concept that describes how the driver operates the vehicle in the context of the driving scene and the surrounding environment. recently, db assessment has become an emerging and very important topic. however, given the stochastic nature of driving, measuring, and modeling, db continues to be a challenging topic today. thus, this paper argues that in order to move forward in understanding the individual and organizational mechanisms influencing db, a conceptual framework is outlined in which db is viewed in terms of the different dimensions established in the driver-vehicle-environment (dve) system. in addition, db assessment has been approached by various machine learning (ml) models. however, there has been no attempt to systematically analyze empirical evidence on ml models, moreover, ml-based db models often face problems and raise questions that need to be resolved. this article presents a systematic literature review (slr) of the concept of db investigasi investigation","driving behavior, machine learning, mt. ph.d",,"postgraduate of industrial engineering student universitas sumatera utara, medan, indonesia mutiairani1997@gmail.com rahim matondang professor of industrial engineering faculty of engineering, universitas sumatera utara medan, indonesia matondangrahim@gmail.com listiani nurul huda lecturer of industrial engineering faculty of engineering, universitas sumatera utara medan, indonesia lnurulhuda@gmail.com",
224,Impact Of Covid-19 On College Students’ Well-Being:  Development Of Chatbot Through Multi-Criteria Decision,"the main objective of this study is to develop a chatbot that helps minimize the negative impact of the new normal on college students’ well-being. in order to do that, the researchers also determined the physical and psychological impact of the covid-19 pandemic on college students in the philippines. to assess the impact of the covid-19 pandemic, the researchers conveniently surveyed 328 college students who are currently enrolled in online classes and are living in the philippines. the data gathered were analyzed using ibm spss and microsoft excel. the test of normality has revealed that there is enough evidence that there is a significant impact of the covid-19 pandemic on the physical (p (0.000) <0.05) and psychological well-being (p (0.000) < 0.05) of college students. furthermore, the study has revealed that there are factors that make the students more vulnerable to experiencing physical discomfort and psychological distress. on the other hand, the study has revealed that there is a weak to negligible correlation between the demographics of the college students and the physical and psychological impact they were experiencing during the pandemic. furthermore, there is a weak correlation between the physical impact and the college students’ human attributes while there is a moderate correlation between the psychological impact and the college students’ human attributes.","well-being, covid-19, pandemic, college students","The researchers based upon the analysis of the survey result through the use of a web-based survey, related literature, Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software, and Microsoft Excel. Furthermore, Convenience Sampling and Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis were used in this study to obtain relevant information and analyze the data gathered. In conclusion, the researchers have found that there are significant factors that make college students more vulnerable to experiencing physical discomfort and psychological distress with a p-value less than 0.05 (p (2.1107E-12) < 0.05). Therefore, talking to professionals, looking for external validation, and searching the web are the factors that make college students more vulnerable to experiencing physical discomfort and psychological distress. Upon using the spearman’s rho correlation to test the relationship between college students’ age, sex, student type, year level, course, school type, and location of schools physical discomfort, and psychological distress they are experiencing, the researchers found that the sex the college students has a weak positive correlation and their year level has a negligible positive correlation on the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on their physical well-being. It means that males and females experience different impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic on their physical well-being. Upon using the spearman’s rho correlation to test the relationship of college students’ sex to psychological well-being, the researchers found that 0.7% of the time, there is a weak positive correlation between sex to the psychological well- being of college students. This implies that the impact of Covid-19 on their psychological well-being varies differently for both sexes. Furthermore, the result of the spearman’s rho correlation states that 84.2% of the time, the college year level and the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on their physical well-being have a negligible positive correlation. The result of the spearman’s rho correlation states that 84.2% of the time, the college year level and the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on their physical well-being have a negligible positive correlation. The result of the spearman’s rho correlation implies that the college students' physical discomfort and their human attributes are positively correlated. This shows that their physical discomfort affects their human attributes. Furthermore, the result of the spearman’s rho correlation shows that the college students' psychological distress and their human attributes are positively correlated, implying that their psychological distress has an impact on their human attributes.","analysis lyka marie m. degala, industrial engineering department adamson university lykamariedegala@gmail.com kharizza jhae m. dela fuente, industrial engineering department adamson university kharizzadelafuente@gmail.com noe d. enriquez, pie, asean eng. research co-adviser director, ippdo adamson university noe.enriquez@adamson.edu.ph dr. venusmar c. quevedo, pie, asean eng. research adviser vice president for administration adamson university vcquevedo@gmail.com",
225,An Application Of The Analytic Hierarchy Process (Ahp)  In Measuring The Service Quality Of Telemedicine,"telemedicine is a service that provides remote clinical services by utilizing telecommunication services. it aims to provide medical care access to patients regardless of geographic challenges. the use of telemedicine in the philippines was underutilized not until the occurrence of the coronavirus (covid-19) pandemic. improving the service quality of telemedicine can help filipinos improve their quality of life using such services. with the use of the service quality (servqual) framework to identify the factors affecting the satisfaction of the patients, online survey questionnaires via google forms were disseminated through different reliable and open access platforms to gather data, and analytic hierarchy process (ahp) to evaluate and analyze the key indicators. based on the result of this study, patients consider assurance as a key indicator of the service quality of telemedicine, with a priority rating of (37.2%). this is followed by reliability (27.1%), empathy (17.6%), responsiveness (12.7%), and tangibility (5.4%). it can also be inferred that among the two (2) sub-criteria under assurance, the competency of the telemedicine service affects their perception of its service quality. furthermore, applying skills training for physicians in telemedicine services can further improve patient satisfaction.",telemedicine,"Based on the result of the study, it can be concluded that, among the five (5) SERVQUAL dimensions, assurance greatly affects patient satisfaction with the service quality of telemedicine with a weight of 37.2%. This is followed by reliability at 27.1%, empathy at 17.6%, responsiveness at 12.7%, and lastly, tangibility at 5.4%. It is also inferred that the competency of the telemedicine personnel greatly affects the service quality of the telemedicine consultation. This signifies that the confidence and level of ignorance of the telemedicine personnel affect the patient’s satisfaction with availing telemedicine service. Furthermore, based on the overall priority as seen in table 5, to address these factors, among the proposed alternatives, the researchers suggest conducting skills training to assure high-quality telemedicine service. Although skills training will incur additional costs for the telemedicine provider, patients, healthcare workers, and telemedicine services will substantially benefit from its implementation. In addition, if the telemedicine service in the Philippines is improved based on the outcome of this research, patients would rely more on telemedicine services due to increased customer satisfaction and improved service image. In return, their transportation costs will be reduced when they have consultations. 1851","in the philippines cez ariana l. camon, micah therese a. diaz, erika therese p. esguerra, and faith anne j. taguba undergraduate student department of industrial engineering university of santo tomas españa boulevard, sampaloc, manila 1008, philippines cezariana.camon.eng@ust.edu.ph, micahtherese.diaz.eng@ust.edu.ph, erikatherese.esguerra.eng@ust.edu.ph, faithanne.taguba.eng@ust.edu.ph engr. gabriel c. bucu, cie, msie, assoc. asean eng professor of industrial engineering faculty of engineering department of industrial engineering university of santo tomas españa boulevard, sampaloc, manila 1008, philippines gcbucu@ust.edu.ph","References

228,A Systematic Approach To Improving Safety Culture  Saed Amer,"this report aims at developing an understanding of the term “safety culture” and its parameters and uses the findings to present guidelines that aim at developing the safety culture within an organization. the understanding of the terms was done through research from international sources on the origin and adaptations of safety culture and what are its indicators. the report details findings on what safety is in general and how it relates to safety culture. as well as what signs of a positive or negative safety culture are within an organization. it also includes a thorough look into safety incidents data and information that justify the need to develop a positive safety culture. finally, the report details procedures that can be implemented to develop a positive safety culture within any organization while providing guidelines on how to monitor and improve the process explained.",safety culture,"The report explored the term “Safety Culture” and its origins of it. As well as its use in recent history. As detailed in the report, there are many different indicators and parameters identified by different resources. This shows how abstract the term is and hence the group has identified nine parameters that will be used as the basis for the development of a Safety Culture within an organization. The report also explores development justification by presenting moral, legal and financial justifications where consequences of different categories can occur due to a poor safety culture. The report also presents examples of incidents that occurred with severe consequences such as the Chernobyl Incident in 1986. The nine identified parameters were used as pillars to develop a set of procedures that improve the Safety Culture of an organization. These procedures are subject to assessment using monitoring and measurement tools. In conclusion, it was identified that Safety Culture is tied to human behavior and not administrative parameters, and to develop it, the actions shall address human behavior, interactions and competencies which are reflected in this report.","faculty member industrial and systems engineering department - khalifa university abu dhabi, united arab emirates saed.amer@ku.ac.ae abdulla jasim al hosani master of health, safety, and environmental engineering industrial and systems engineering department - khalifa university abu dhabi, united arab emirates 100063195@ku.ac.ae abdulla yousuf al marzooqi master of health, safety, and environmental engineering industrial and systems engineering department - khalifa university abu dhabi, united arab emirates abdulla.alm@qcc.gov.ae, 100062600@ku.ac.ae abdulla hussain alshabibi master of health, safety, and environmental engineering industrial and systems engineering department - khalifa university abu dhabi, united arab emirates 100059670@ku.ac.ae",
229,Effects Of Prolonged Sitting Posture On Neck And Shoulder  Joints During Occupational Driving:,"this study investigates the impact of prolonged driving posture for occupational drives on the upper back muscles. there have been limited papers in the literature that studies the upper body muscles hence this study focuses specifically on neck and shoulder muscles. a human simulation software called jack software was used to measure the impact of the driving posture on these muscles. three different trunk conditions relative to the angles were adopted as follows: extension, neutral and flexion. the trail incorporated four different postures to mimic the real driving experience including the neck muscle at the neutral position, neck lateral rotation to the left and neck extension. the results of this study reveal that the lowest discomfort levels of both neck and shoulders were measured at the trunk flexion position, thus it suggested that a proper headrest that would support the neck at 15 degrees’ extension would help to reduce the strain on the joint.","jack software, torque force","The study results showed that the lowest discomfort levels of the neck and shoulders are at the trunk flexion position, which is contrary to the expectation of having the lowest discomfort at the neutral position since this is the most common driving position. Among the results of the study, it is useful to note that the addition of a proper headrest that would support the neck at 15 degrees extension would help to reduce the strain on the joint. Future work recommended to validate the findings of this study is to measure the pressure during the different postures to assess to which extent it matches the comfort assessments and hence propose a better and improved seat design for industrial vehicles.","human ergonomic simulation software aisha ali hasan mohamed dhaiban msc. student department of industrial engineering khalifa university, abu dhabi, united arab emirates 100042637@ku.ac.ae areej mabrouk abdrabo bin amro msc. student department of industrial engineering khalifa university, abu dhabi, united arab emirates 100042689@ku.ac.ae dr. saed amer faculty member industrial and systems engineering department - khalifa university abu dhabi, united arab emirates saed.amer@ku.ac.ae",

Unfortunately, food waste shows a significant increase worldwide due to the increase in population. While UAE trying to reduce food waste, they still report a high food waste volume of 3.2 million tonnes annually. Per the estimation, the food waste in the offshore locations is 10,840,500 kg/year. This amount of waste cost 11,856,797 $ which consider huge. Therefore, this issue should be addressed to achieve sustainable development and to meet the UAE zero waste vision. Thus, a food waste management system must be introduced to offshore locations to minimize food waste and its associated impacts. In this research, a proposed method and recommendations were introduced to reduce the amount of waste. Offshore companies must endorse guidelines and provide procedures to be followed by individual and kitchen staff. Additionally, they must utilize advanced solutions to start making use of food waste.

232,Impact Of Wholesale Price Contracts In Two-Echelon  Supply Chains Under Production Disruptions,"in this study, we analyze a two-echelon supply chain consisting of a manufacturer and a retailer operating in a monopolistic market under production disruptions due to pandemic workforce restrictions. in this work, the production disruptions occur at the manufacturer, which is transmitted to the retailer. the objective of this study is to analyze supply chain performance in uncoordinated and coordinated situations. our results show that a coordinated situation, where coordination is achieved through a wholesale price contract, has a higher optimal order quantity compared to an uncoordinated situation.",,"and Future Research This study ensures supply chain coordination using a wholesale price contract in a two-echelon supply chain with interruptions and fluctuating demand. In this analysis, order quantity is used as a decision variable, with a focus on determining a wholesale price in a no-coordination scenario and limits on the wholesale price in a coordination scenario to determine how intermittency is affected. In this study, a wholesale price contract was created, and it was shown that coordination could be achieved through this contract if the manufacturer and the retailer agree on a total sales price that falls between the calculated limits. It also compared the optimal order quantity and profits under coordinated and non-coordinated scenarios. The study concludes that the optimal order quantity under coordination is always larger than the optimal order quantity under non-coordination when the wholesale price that facilitates coordination is agreed upon. This study is limited to a two-stage serial supply chain. Future work may focus on incorporating multi-stage supply chains. This study does not include an actual case study to support its modelling. Future work may focus on the inclusion of a real enterprise supply chain.","t. abdul basith and sajith babu department of mechanical engineering government engineering college thrissur basitht2945@gmail.com, sajithbabu@gectcr.ac.in anand abraham department of industrial and systems engineering indian institute of technology kharagpur anandjacobabraham@gmail.com",

U.S. manufacturing also does well on the international plane by emerging second in terms of manufacturing output after China. U.S. manufacturers now have a competitive advantage in competitive business environments thanks to technological advancements that have enabled them to achieve greater success. It was unfortunate to witness the extent to which the Covid-19 global pandemic frustrated the U.S. manufacturing sector by having a crippling effect on supply chains. In this respect, it is imperative that the U.S. government invests more in the manufacturing sector to make it more ready to deal with future unanticipated catastrophes that threaten this invaluable sector. On the same note, it is important that the government invests in ensuring that employment in the manufacturing sector is revitalized to continue benefitting ordinary citizens whose sole reliance is on the income they derive from the manufacturing sector. When this happens, it is inevitable that the future of the U.S. manufacturing sector would become promising across all domains, be it through employment or with regard to the economy.","department of automotive and manufacturing engineering technology minnesota state university mankato, mn 56001, usa monisa.ansha@mnsu.edu pawan.bhandari@mnsu.edu",

240,"Lowering Cost Of Photovoltaic Systems Using Forecast  Dependent Design, Monitoring And Management","the target of current work is to cut off the cost of solar energy systems by using weather forecasting to predict energy production and implementing energy management measures to optimize the use of energy and reduce the need for energy storage. for standalone systems, this can include reducing the number of pv panels and battery banks, while still ensuring that there is enough energy to meet user needs. the energy management system you describe monitors the power level of the storage elements and adaptively controls switching to minimize the number of panels and battery banks needed. for grid-connected systems, the goal is to calculate the energy produced by the system and use that information to arrive at a zero-balance bill, considering the user's daily and nighttime energy consumption. the proposed energy management procedures are designed to reduce costs by optimizing the use of energy. the percentage of cost reduction has been determined for both types of systems.","solar energy, lowering the cost, forecasting, particularly oil","From the result of the analysis in the case study, the following conclusions were drawn: 1. The two ways of construct the system are stand-alone solar system and grid-connected solar system; the stand- alone from the name added storage device like the battery ad voltage regulator, while in grid-connected those two-equipment cancelled from the system, but that does not mean the cost pf grid-connected will be always lower than the stand-alone. 2. The cost of implanting the system are depends into many factors, and they are divided into 3 main categories (Manufacturing parameters, Geographic parameters, Special parameter), so the location will be construct the system affect, the type of the devices will affect also, the lifespan of the PV, invertor, and other devices, and for the grid-connected the tariff of the electricity will affect the total price too. 3.

242,Ergonomic Assessment Of Copra Cake Manual Material  Handling Process: A Basis For The Design Of An,"ergonomics studies how people interact with other system components, thus ensuring that the task and individual are compatible. musculoskeletal disorders (msds) are the leading causes of poor ergonomics. meanwhile, abc oil mill is a producer of coconut oil and copra cake. manual copra cake handling was one of the processes being observed in the company and chosen due to most workers encountering msds such as fatigue, back pain, shoulder pain, etc. the researchers used different ergonomic assessments such as the rapid upper limb assessment (rula), rapid entire body assessment (reba), and the washington industrial safety and health act (wisha) lifting analysis. based on the result, reba had a final score of seven (7), while rula resulted in a score of ten (10), with an equivalent of high risk, indicating that the process must be investigated, and change must be implemented. moreover, the wisha results show that the lifting index is greater than 1, denoting a high risk in the process. from the ergonomic assessment results, the researchers have developed a design of copra cake lifting equipment. using the anthropometric data of the workers, some of the highlights of the designs are: (1) it is maneuverable with an adjustable platform; (2) with push buttons for the lift; and (3) with a motor that helps to lift the sacks.","msds, rula, reba","Based on the findings of the ergonomic assessments (RULA, REBA, and WISHA Lifting Analysis) and initial observations at the ABC Oil Mill, the researchers have determined the existing risk factors (high lifting index, high repetition, improper posture, and excessive physical exertion) that compromises the health and safety of workers who are exposed to manual lifting of heavy loads of copra cake. The actual root cause of the discomfort, usually manifesting as muscle pain, through a series of why-why analysis and root cause validation in collaboration with the selected workers with direct experience to the task. The lack of effective lifting equipment was found to be the major issue that contributes to high risk of developing WMSDs among the workers at the oil mill. To address the problem, the researcher integrated various tools and techniques in designing the ergonomic copra cake lifting equipment. Anthropometric measurements of the workers and ergonomic principles were integrated to specify the features and dimensions of the lifting equipment. The proposed equipment has the following new and improved functions: high maneuverability/portability, an adjustable lifting platform, an electrical motor to support the lift through a pulley system, a manual pedal), and an improved handle. Using the ergonomic lifting equipment, there has been a reduction in the number of absences of workers due to experienced back and shoulder pain. Efficiency also increased; the number of required workers in the manual lifting task was reduced from two to one, while also increasing the average lifts per minute from one sack of copra cake to two sacks – suggesting an increase in productivity. The workers were able to avoid additional expenses associated with availing remedies to alleviate the pain that they experienced before after performing the task without the use of the lifting equipment. Meanwhile, the respondents of the survey assessing the acceptability of the proposed equipment showed strong agreement that the proposed equipment is effective in eliminating risk factors and improving worker performance in lifting copra cake sacks. The study benefits the workers and owners at ABC Oil Mill by improving their current process and promoting health and safety in their workplace. Developing the ergonomic copra cake lifting equipment highlights the significance of using ergonomic tools and equipment to reduce risk factors that contribute to the development of WMSDs, as well as to boost the productivity and performance of workers through the improved working conditions. For future studies, the researchers recommend the use of other in-depth assessments and measurement tools to further improve the overall design and specifications of the equipment; it is also important to consider other factors (e.g. environmental factors) that may have direct effect on the performance and well-being of the workers.","ergonomic equipment roland emerson mabuting, dr. james louie r. meneses, laurence binasa college of engineering manuel s. enverga university foundation lucena city, quezon, philippines ermabuting@gmail.com; jameslouie.meneses@mseuf.edu.ph; laurencebinasa@gmail.com",

The methods were suggested to the soft drink companies and are being implemented in the future. Continuous checkups will be done to further test the companies’ abilities to adapt to these sustainable practices. In the end, since the food and beverage industry is causing a lot of environmental damage, it is our ethical and professional responsibility to find methods to make this industry more sustainable. The feasibility study showed that rPET is a better choice for the packaging issue, as benchmarking showed that it is already being used by other international companies around the world. The study also showed that RO is a better choice for water treatment as it removes more contaminants than ultrafiltration and that it has a longer lifespan as well. Arena simulation also proved that RO does in fact save 25% of feed water that goes into the system. By conducting a feasibility analysis, choosing between alternative solutions, creating a real-life simulation of water treatment, and conducting a regression analysis, we were able to find several different methods of evidence that prove that there is always a way to become more sustainable. Finally, analysis of the ESG data also showed that there is a U-shaped relationship between firm value and Environmental pillar score. This means the firms need to continue with the Environmental initiatives by following up with the results and this will have a sustained effect on the firm value.","fay alsanaee; abdullah s. karamanf college of engineering and technology american university of the middle east, kuwait a 43892@aum.edu.kw ;b 41027@aum.edu.kw c 44912@aum.edu.kw;d 42892@aum.edu.kw e 42891@aum.edu.kw;f abdullah.karaman@aum.edu.kw",

247,Assessment Of Factors Influencing Purchase Intention For  Green Cosmetic Products,"recent global environmental challenges have increased the demand for sustainable consumption and the use of green products around the world. one such example of green product is green cosmetics. the cosmetic industry is widely criticized for contributing to environmental and public health hazards due to the use of toxic chemicals. as a result, the manufacturing and distribution of eco-friendly cosmetics are receiving ongoing attention from both businesses and the markets. the purpose of this study is to identify the factors that influence customers inclination to purchase natural and organic cosmetics. a thorough assessment of the literature resulted in the identification of twelve distinct criteria and by using factor analysis these factors were reduced into three dimensions. a hierarchy was then established and ahp was used to come up with a comprehensive list of factors along with their degree of importance. the data for this study was gathered using a quantitative research approach and a total of 156 responses were obtained using an online questionnaire promoted through e-mails and social media platforms. this study adds to the knowledge base of managers on how they can encourage the use of green cosmetics and orient their strategies to address consumers environmental concerns.","green cosmetics, purchase intention","Time and money were the most significant limitations placed on the study. More factors could have been taken into consideration, but only a small sample size was used for this research. In subsequent research, it may be possible to take into account a larger sample size in addition to an increased number of factors. Also, researchers might take into account a variety of research approaches, such as in order to determine ranks, important weights, and cause-and-effect relationships. The goal can be accomplished through the implementation of DEMATEL, VIKOR, and other similar analysis techniques. In the beginning, factors were found through a review of the relevant literature. In addition, the identified factors were refined after taking into account both the domain knowledge and the results of the literature review. The final step was to compile a list of the 12 factors that influence a person's intention to buy environmentally friendly cosmetics. Taking all of these considerations into account, a questionnaire was developed. The responses were obtained through the use of a simple random sampling method. A total of 156 responses were gathered from approximately 700 people who were questioned after they were approached. The gathered information was analyzed with SPSS 26.0 using factor analysis, principal component analysis (PCA), and other statistical methods. Authors were able to identify a total of three principal components, which served as the basis for the subsequent development of the factor hierarchy. The three primary factors were the environmental, personal, and social factors. The study that was carried out will serve as a foundation for researchers in the future. The developed framework could be taken into consideration by subsequent researchers for the purpose of advancing research on topics related to purchase intention and environmentally friendly cosmetic products.","neha anchliya department of management studies malaviya national institute of technology jaipur, india nehaanchliya@gmail.com sandip agarwalla department of management studies malaviya national institute of technology jaipur, india sandipagarwal96@gmail.com akshay patidar department of management studies malaviya national institute of technology jaipur, india patidarakshay03@gmail.com monica sharma associate professor department of management studies malaviya national institute of technology jaipur, india msharma.dms@mnit.ac.in",
248,Employing The Internet Of Things  To Attain Resilience Across Supply Chain,"development in the field of it and competition in the market forces companies to increase their market share and revenue. to satisfy this goal, companies can apply and adopt plans that may lead to making the supply chain (sc) lengthy and too rigid to control/monitor. the longer the sc the more it can be disrupted by expected and unexpected events (e.g., digital security incidents, climate). for that purpose, the sc must be built in a way to respond fast to disruptive events in an effective way and to bounce back to its original state to be considered a resilient sc, which gives a competitive advantage to the companies. to achieve sc resilience, several studies have discussed enablers. some of these studies, focused on increasing velocity through the sc, others argued that high adaptability leads to sc resilience, and others mentioned information sharing as a key to achieving sc resilience. in addition, applying technology in the sc processes can add strength. as such, the internet of things can support/enhance the level of velocity, adaptability, and information sharing, which leads to enhancing sc resilience. this research explores the opportunities that iot presents to enhance resilience enablers and boost sc resilience.","supply chains, iot, internet of things, velocity","Many different enablers may fit in a particular supply chain better than others in terms of resolving hazards and increasing resilience. As a result, a list of specific enablers tailored to the domain, criteria, and needs of the business may be focused on to ensure supply chain resilience. In this paper, a module has presented the benefits of utilising IoT for resilience enablers in the supply chain. To achieve high-performance supply chain processes and gain future robustness to achieve resilience. We focused on three key enablers of supply chain resilience: velocity, Information sharing, and adaptability. Our research has emphasized the use of smart devices and IoT technologies in rebuilding traditional supply chains by focusing on three enablers that deliver resilience across the SC, Moreover, due to the limited research discussing the effect IoT has on SCRes, this study focuses on implementing smart technology on supply chain functions such as product tracking and tracing, With data and sharing information in real-time, IoT promises quick and accurate information throughout the supply chain. When it comes to resilience and the supply chain, it's evident that there are various areas and prospects for further research when it comes to Internet technology. 2075","moayad al-talib centre for supply chain improvement, university of derby, derby, uk, de22 1gb modtalib87@gmail.com wasen y. melhem computer information systems, yarmouk university, irbid, jordan 21163 wasenmel.1991@gmail.com walid k. al saad, simon peter nadeem, anthony i. anosike, and jose arturo garza-reyes centre for supply chain improvement, university of derby, derby, uk, de22 1gb w.alsaad@derby.ac.uk, s.nadeem@derby.ac.uk, a.anosike@derby.ac.uk, j.reyes@derby.ac.uk","References

250,Evaluating Factors Influencing Filipinos’ Perceived  Behavior To Boost Healthy Lifestyle Through Multiple,"physical inactivity and unhealthy lifestyle among individuals are persistent societal problems that have negative implications on one’s health. with the covid-19 pandemic breakout, there has been an alarming rise in sedentary behaviors, a decrease in fitness activities engagement, and apparent physical inactivity among people across different countries. by integrating the theory of effort minimization (tempa) and protection motivation theory (pmt) with socio-ecological factors into a single framework, this study aims to identify factors influencing the perceived behavior of filipinos toward facilitating physical fitness and lifestyle wellness. through the convenience sampling method, a self-administered questionnaire was disseminated using online platforms, with a total of 565 filipinos being considered for this study. results from multiple linear regression analysis showed that age (p-value = 0.005), media (p-value = 0.023), self-efficacy (p-value = 0.000), intent to adapt (p-value = 0.002), income (p-value = 0.034), and diet (p-value = 0.000) were the key variables that affects the perceived behavior of filipinos in boosting physical fitness and lifestyle wellness. this study has structured a model that could be utilized by the fitness industry, different government and educational institutions, health maintenance organizations (hmos), and other private and public institutions to establish effective strategies and interventions through fitness programs that will promote fitness and lifestyle wellness among different stakeholders.","physical activity, lifestyle wellness","The high prevalence of physical inactivity and sedentary behaviors of Filipinos, fueled more by the COVID-19 lockdowns, resulted in adverse health effects and a weakened immune system; therefore the necessity for health- promoting behaviors are necessary to reduce the risk of diseases and improve health outcomes. This study identified factors affecting Filipinos' perceived behavioral intention to boost physical fitness and lifestyle, considering individual factors, ME, CU, M, and incorporating both the Protection Motivation Theory (PMT) and the Theory of Effort Minimization in Physical Activity (TEMPA). These factors were assessed using a multiple regression analysis. Results indicate Salary/Income and SE have a positive direct and high significance to PB. At the same time, Exercise Often, Age, ITA, ME, and Diet were seen to have a significant negative effect on PB. The belief in one's capability and financial capacity contributes to engaging in healthier routines. With that, it would also increase the likelihood of an individual becoming a health-oriented person if they are encouraged at the earliest stage of their life with less media exposure. Though limitations were presented, the study could be utilized by the fitness industry, government, local government units (LGUs), and private and public institutions to create successful fitness and wellness programs. 2085","regression analysis yoshiki b. kurata, alyssa laraine m. cunanan, alwin g. lumbres, kyle gericho m. palomares, christine denise a. vargas and abiel m. badillo department of industrial engineering university of santo tomas españa blvd, 1015, manila, philippines ybkurata@ust.edu.ph, ambadillo@ust.edu.ph, alyssalaraine.cunanan.eng@ust.edu.ph, alwin.lumbres.eng@ust.edu.ph, kylegericho.palomares.eng@ust.edu.ph, christinedenise.vargas.eng@ust.edu.ph","References

If the purpose is to identify the bottleneck of an operation system or to define a product design, a Level 1 digital twin which is a virtual entity of the system or design is sufficient to solve the problem. On the other hand, if the purpose is to be able to decide and to make immediate changes to the current state of the system, for example, how many toll lanes to be opened with the immediate influx of car into the toll gates, then a Level 2 digital twin should be implemented. With the use of the virtual system to identify the performance of the physical entity, one solves the problem by intervening the current state of the physical entity manually. Lastly, if the purpose is to predict what will happen to the physical entity from the data trend so as to know what is the best action plan for the next period of time. One should adopt a level 3 digital twin. The approach also simplified the way how the terminology is characterized from nineteen points to three points. Instead of focusing on the industry or the area of application, it emphasizes on how the data come from, the period of the data that is needed and how long is the impact to the physical entity. When someone asks for a digital twin solution, one could then response by clarifying the purpose of the solution. By knowing the purpose, one could know what level of digital twin is necessary to solve the problem.

255,Improvement Of Work Inspection Process In A Construction  Project Using Lean Based Sustainability,"lean-based sustainability targets reduction in different types of waste such as material, time, and labor. lean thinking and sustainability share similar goals of using processes efficiently using different tools and technology. this paper analyzes lean and sustainability under a system thinking lean using the perspectives concept that improves the current process for work inspection requests in a construction project in qatar. the current process mainly utilizes manual steps and physical paperwork. the suggested improvements were implementing an electronic workflow system, purchasing ipads for inspection, and removing redundant steps. as a result, the suggestions were found to reduce total process time and lead time and significantly reduce the material used. cost comparison and sustainability indicators also supported the findings, showing that the improved process is better than the current one in the respective criteria.","lean thinking, sustainability, construction","This paper presented a lean-based methodology for enhancing the work-inspection request process performance in a construction project. The process includes 24 steps and has been reduced to 13 steps by introducing an electronic workflow system, iPad for inspections, and removing redundancies. As a result, process time was reduced by 41 %, lead time by 61 %, and the material used by 100 %. A cost comparison of the two processes showed that the electronic system (improved process) is cheaper than the manual system (current process), considering annual costs. Furthermore, the lean-based methodology was linked to sustainability indicators grouped into environmental, economic & social. The improved process was found to be more sustainable.","syeda manahil akhter, dalal abuhrma, noora al-emadi, yasmeen almutairi, mechanical and industrial engineering department college of engineering, qatar university doha, qatar sa1603854@qu.edu.qa, da1604532@qu.edu.qa, 200256192@qu.edu.qa, ya2109505@qu.edu.qa galal m. abdella associate professor at the department of industrial engineering college of engineering, qatar university doha, qatar gmg5005@qu.edu.qa",
256,Continuous Improvement (Ci) Methodology:  A Sustainability Mechanism In Schools,"the institutionalization of continuous improvement highlights the need for personnel across all levels of governance, to accept change in program implementations. it must be embedded in the system to sustain the data-driven approach of identifying first the main cause of the problems, then testing for the best possible strategies for the life-long benefits of the solutions. this study dwelt on determining how the ci methodology can be sustained in different ci schools in deped region v. the non- experimental quantitative research mode was used to capture the data that naturally exist in the completion and utilization of projects. the descriptive-evaluative survey method was used. it was noted as findings in this study that the training and coaching to teams have influenced them to work on interventions focusing on improving the teaching and learning processes. the ci projects became useful ideas in delivering blended learning modalities by making and using its new versions in audio lessons, video lessons, self-learning modules, and learning activity sheets. their focus is limited to the implementation and not to the application of ci methodology in the system operations. it is recommended that calibrated measures of sustainability practices, focusing on promising sustainability procedures and emerging practices, are structured and designed.",toolkit,"and Recommendation “Continuous improvement has been proven useful and effective in various industries, and schools and districts incorporating continuous improvement into their work have shown promising results” the findings of Jane Best and Allison Dunlap (2014) Conclusion The learning gaps as well as school concerns addressed by the completion and rollout of CI projects in schools proved that Continuous Improvement Methodology is at present the most effective means for schools to produce timely interventions that work and will alleviate our Learning Poverty issues. The initial undertaking of schools to sustain CI gives the researcher a possibility that the methodology can be sustained if it will be communicated through standard guidelines and technical assistance mechanisms that practitioners may easily refer to for review or technical assistance provision. The suggested sustainability plans provided in the survey can aid the researchers in a policy recommendation formulation to ensure that CIM is implemented and effectively practiced in all schools in the region. CI has laid the most complex cognitive and technical activities in which concerned individuals became engaged, in making ideas to address the priority improvement areas doable and remarkable. It requires a concerted and collaborative effort by advocates, educators, researchers, and policymakers with a focus on long-term solutions as much as possible. The CI solutions are expected to be translated into practices and policies. In a challenging world like the Department of Education, interventions or new solutions are imperative. Many activities are being delivered, many teams and organizations have been organized and many innovations are being introduced but still many fail to meet the expected learning outcomes. To ensure acquiring benefits in the school/organization, a very supportive, proactive, and open to new possibilities is required to limit the waste of effort, time, and resources. All actions are headed towards sustainable effects on the school community. Recommendations It is recommended to have an investigation on how the non-CI team members in the school community perceived the step-by- step completion undertakings of a CI project, what is their capacity to support the co-members of the school community who are directly involved in the CI team, and what are their misconceptions about the methodology of continuous improvement. The Learning and Development (L&D) of the Department of Education is now a requirement in hiring and promotion which is now connected to Merit Selection Plan (MSP). The MSP highlights the inclusion of the application of L&D or intervention made by an applicant relevant to the position being applied for. This is a good starting point for another research journey dwelling on how the implementation requirements of the system directly influence the highest points to be credited in the equivalent pertinent documents for recruitment, assessment, and selection processes in the MSP. 2122","evangeline a. saculo and teresa t. buasan deped regional office v rawis, legaspi city evangelie.saculo@deped.gov.ph, teresa.buasan@deped.gov.ph joretze s. carandang schools division office naga city joretze.carandang@deped.gov.ph","References

259,International Conference On Industrial Engineering And Operations Management  The Garden Battle: A Comparative Study On The Tensile,"as technology advances, climate change comes along with it. the world advances towards an era where everything can be easily manufactured. so, it is essential to know which materials and resources to use and utilize. this study was conducted to know which organic material is stronger as the main component in the production of bioplastics. such findings benefit the companies that produce or plan to produce eco-friendly bioplastics. the emerging need to use sustainable materials pushed them to divulge in this study. moreover, this redounds to the benefit of humanity, considering that non-biodegradable materials continue to litter the planet. this paper aimed to promote sustainability and resourcefulness by identifying the better material for manufacturing bioplastics. the literature review presented a detailed discussion on plastics. from how it is caused, up to how it should be reduced and diminished. the researchers prepared samples of corn-based and cassava-based bioplastic, and prepared samples of petroleum-based plastic to serve as the standard in this comparative study. these samples were tested under a series of trials to determine the difference between their tensile strength. the researchers analyzed the results of these trials by using the independent samples t-test as a statistical tool to determine the statistical difference between these bioplastics in terms of their tensile properties, with the petroleum-based plastic packages as the standard. from there, the researchers concluded that corn-based bioplastics are up to par with petroleum-based plastics regarding tensile strength. however, it is recommended to try a more relevant test to have more in-depth knowledge of these plastics.","sustainability, bioplastics","Fail to reject H0. Based on table 9, since the p-value acquired was 1.0303x10-25 and less than the α of 0.05, the null hypothesis can be rejected. Therefore, traditional plastics have statistically higher tensile strength than cassava-based bioplastics. Table 15. Independent samples test: cassava and traditional t df Sig. value (2- tailed) Mean Difference 22.984 42 2.06E-25 2.03364 5.3 Proposed Improvements Based on the results and conclusion, it was considered that both extracted polymers from each starch are a feasible option as replacement for plastics. The gathered data indicates that the mean tensile strength values for both components catch up with the industry benchmark mean value of the plastic industry. In addition, the proponents highly recommend that the respondents utilize biodegradable plastics rather than conventional plastics. Due to the cost-benefit analysis, the best recommendation/action plan for how the respondents can benefit from the study is to adapt and embrace the greener option. This would be beneficial for the environment of the nation or the planet and the plastic manufacturing industry. The action plan could be implemented by investing in research and development pertaining to sustainability. It is important to fund research studies such as this, so that information on bioplastics will continuously improve. With that, innovative ideas and technological advancements will immensely grow. It is important to acknowledge papers on biodegradable plastic and take it a lot further. Adapting solutions in reducing waste will be world changing. There is still knowledge that could be tapped on which can be obliging to society. Most importantly, it may be profitable to companies without damaging the environment. 6. Conclusion and Recommendations The possibilities for the optimum component in the manufacture of biodegradable plastic packaging were determined by statistical analysis of the dependent variable resulting from the independent variable. With the statistical analysis of the study, corn-based starch would be the ideal choice for the primary component, which would be greatly beneficial for the local farmers and corn harvesters, the plastics sector with regard to the manufacturers of plastics, and the corn industry. This would imply that the findings of the study, which compared the tensile qualities of the two components, could support manufacturers in evaluating which would be more advantageous to use as the primary component in the creation of bioplastics. 2160","properties between corn-based and cassava-based bioplastics damirson a. co, lourd albert t. bañaga, daniel marco m. dela concha, darcy c. mariano, charlton lance s. reyes department of industrial engineering, faculty of engineering university of santo tomas españa blvd, 1015, manila philippines daco@ust.edu.ph, lourdalbert.banaga.eng@ust.edu.ph, danielmarco.delaconcha.eng@ust.edu.ph, darcy.mariano.eng@ust.edu.ph, charltonlance.reyes.eng@ust.edu.ph","References

260,Detection Of Lung Cancer With Enhanced Feed Forward  Backpropagation Artificial Neural Networks,"although cancer is a broad term, it is an important problem that causes a high rate of death. it indicates disease that occurs when cellular changes cause cells to grow and divide uncontrollably. cancerous cells can form tumors, damage the immune system, and cause other aberrations that prevent the body from functioning properly. in particular, lung cancer is the type of cancer with the highest death rate in the last five years. the important thing in lung cancer is early diagnosis and diagnosis to ensure the survival of patients. in this study, a model that automatically detects lung cancer has been developed in order to detect lung cancer early and take the necessary precautions at the first stage of the disease. the aim of our study is to diagnose the presence of lung cancer cells based on attributes and information from human symptoms. in our study, a dataset consisting of 26 features and 3 classes determining lung cancer as low, medium and high was used. some preprocessing and transformations have been done to make the data more suitable for predictive analysis. the first 26 features were used as the inputs of the model. the lung cancer feature was used as the predicted output based on the input features. the values of the attributes are normalized. in the first stage, data preprocessing was carried out with various data mining techniques in order to process the data more easily and increase the performance. in the proposed model, feedforward backpropagation artificial neural network model was used to detect the presence of lung cancer in the body of the person. unlike other studies, the factors that cause lung cancer by producing our own neural network have been determined. when the results obtained are compared with the studies in the literature, it has been observed that it gives very successful results.","lung cancer, neural network, backpropagation","Lung cancer is the formation of tumors in the lung as a result of abnormal and uncontrollable proliferation of lung cells. Lung cancer has become the most common type of cancer in the world in parallel with the increase in smoking habits. Due to the importance of the subject, November has been chosen as 'Lung Cancer Awareness Month' around the world. Although it is a fatal disease, early diagnosis of the disease is very important. As in all types of cancer, in the treatment of lung cancer, it is possible to diagnose and fully treat the disease at the first stage with early diagnosis. Identifying the disease in its early stages is very important in terms of treatment. In our study, this important disease was handled and the early diagnosis and diagnosis of the disease was emphasized. An automated neural network model has been developed to detect the disease early. In our study, a data set containing information about the risk status of people with and without lung cancer (3 classes as low, medium and high) was used. Some preprocessing and transformations have been made on the utilized datasets in order to make the data more suitable for predictive analysis. With this research, the presence of lung cancer cells can be detected based on the attributes and information from human symptoms using Artificial Neural Network. Then, the Artificial Neural Networks model was trained and validated. In the Artificial Neural Networks model, it was able to predict the presence of lung cancer with 98.75% accuracy after 10000 learning cycles with less than 1% training error rate. In addition, the model obtained showed that chronic diseases were the most influential feature on the presence of lung cancer. This study showed that the neural network can diagnose lung cancer, so it can be used by doctors as a diagnostic tool. This study showed that the neural network can diagnose lung cancer, so it can be used by doctors as a diagnostic tool. In the future, it is aimed to increase the success of the study by automatically modeling different network structures on different and very large real datasets. In addition, the difference of our study from other studies is that we create 2169","volkan çetin, hacı hüsnü yumrukaya, çiğdem bakır msc of student computer enginering msc of student computer enginering assistant professor doctor of computer enginering computer engineering kutahya dumlupinar university kutahya, turkey cigdem.bakir@dpu.edu.tr","References

261,A Pdca Approach On Determining Factors To Increase The,"this study evaluates the productivity in terms of number of transactions, earnings, and profit of a local online delivery service operated by a tech start-up company that has seen increased sales but not profit. through pdca, this study identified the problems that affect the productivity of the company the most, the root causes of the top problem, and their correlation with the productivity of the company. furthermore, solutions were formulated to help the company improve its productivity for the next year. the assessment began with data collection through interviews and survey questionnaires which were run through various quality control tools as well as correlation analysis. at this stage, it was determined that the poor user interface of the application causes the most problems for the company in terms of productivity. from here, various concrete solutions were formulated for high-impact root causes that were controllable and a corresponding risk assessment plan was developed. with a detailed monitoring and response plan, the solutions provided will help the company as well as other companies within the delivery services industry.","start-up, productivity, quality control","Upon the completion of data collection and analysis, different problems that affect the company’s productivity were identified from each department. The top five problems that affect the productivity of the company the most were found to be as follow respectively: poor user interface of an application, failure to meet expectations of key accounts in terms of number of users, several glitches in the technical system, repeatedly occurring problems in partnering with merchants, low number of orders received by the rider in a day, poor order-matching for riders, frequent delay in delivering the orders, outdated merchant operational status and lack of customer loyalty. Through the affinity diagram and matrix diagram, it was found that there is a specific department within the company that affects its productivity and this department was found to be the IT/Tech Department which has the problem of “poor user interface of the application.” This problem keeps the company from sustaining profit despite the increase in the number of users that register on the app. Through correlation analysis, it was verified with a Pearson’s r value of -0.686 that as the number of registered users increases, the profit of the company decreases. However, with a significance level of 0.133, this relationship is not significant. Looking at the relationship between the number of registered users and number of transactions (r = 0.822) as well as the costs incurred (r = 0.814), Pearson’s r value indicates a high positive relationship for both pairs and a significance level below 0.05 thus the relationship is significant. This means that although the users are converted into paying customers, these customers do not spend enough to cover the expenses incurred by the company in fulfilling customer orders. The high impact and controllable root causes of the top 1 problem are the following: (1) App was not assessed thoroughly, (2) Lack of planning prior to designing and, (3) Lack of funding. By identifying the root causes of this problem through the cause and effect diagram, the high impact and controllable root causes were identified. Furthermore, the tree diagram and prioritization matrix were used to determine the alternative solutions that would have the highest impact on the productivity of the company once implemented. The following solutions were recommended by the researchers to improve the productivity of the company: (1) Perform periodic app maintenance to test wireframe functionality, (2) Receive and review customer feedback and use them for improvements, (3) Provide training for employees working on the app, (4) Improve existing projects to make them more efficient, (5) Settle receivables from partner merchants at most within 45 days, (6) Create standardized checklists for app improvement and, (7) Conduct meetings with developers and designers Along with these solutions, a detailed response and monitoring plan are added to give recommendations to the company in addressing the root cause that affects its productivity the most.","online delivery service company alexa mae i. manrique, aliyah geeña l. naldoza, mae angelica s. salonga, maxine hannah s. villanueva department of industrial engineering university of santo tomas, españa boulevard, sampaloc, manila 1008, philippines alexamae.manrique.eng@ust.edu.ph, aliyahgeena.naldoza.eng@ust.edu.ph, maeangelica.salonga.eng@ust.edu.ph, maxinehannah.villanueva.eng@ust.edu.ph engr. charlie a. marquez, msie, pie department of industrial engineering university of santo tomas españa boulevard, sampaloc, manila 1008, philippines ccmarquez@ust.edu.ph",
262,Exploring The Barriers To Implementing Solar Energy In An  Emerging Economy:,"the use of solar energy as a renewable energy source is becoming increasingly popular globally as a way to reduce dependence on fossil fuels and minimize negative environmental impacts. however, in emerging economies, the implementation of solar energy is often hindered by several barriers. these barriers present significant challenges for policymakers in achieving comprehensive energy sustainability. this study aims to identify and analyze the most significant barriers to implementing solar energy in emerging economies, as well as the relationships between these barriers. thirteen barriers were identified through a review of the literature and input from experts and were analyzed using the decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (dematel) method. the results revealed that 'high upfront costs', and 'limited access to land and resources for large-scale projects' are the two most prominent barriers to implementing solar energy in emerging economies. analysis of the cause-and-effect relationships between these barriers identified 'limited access to land and resources for large-scale projects' as the most significant cause and 'limited access to financing' as the least significant cause. the findings of this study are expected to assist policymakers in emerging economies in addressing these barriers and successfully implementing solar energy to achieve long-term energy sustainability and support sustainable development goals (sdgs).","solar energy, barriers","In recent years, the concept of sustainability has gained significant attention in political and economic discussions. Policymakers have recognized the harmful effects of traditional fossil fuel-based energy systems on the environment. However, despite the potential benefits of solar energy, there is a lack of research linking the use of solar energy and the Sustainable Development Goals in emerging economies. The current study aims to bridge this gap by connecting these two important concepts to promote a sustainable future. The unique aspect of this study is its use of the DEMATEL method to identify, prioritize and understand the cause- and-effect relationships between the barriers to implementing solar energy. An interesting finding from the results is that the most prominent barrier and the most causal barrier are not always the same. This highlights that a barrier may be important, but may not necessarily be the root cause of other barriers. This study analyzed 13 barriers related to the implementation of solar energy, of which 5 were identified as the root causes and the remaining 8 as the effects. Policymakers must understand these causal relationships between the barriers to achieving specific Sustainable Development Goals. Emerging economies should pay particular attention to the barriers identified as causes in this study to minimize the negative impact of other barriers that may arise and achieve long-term sustainability in line with the UN SDGs. The study has limitations that need to be addressed in future research, such as the DEMATEL method only considering influencing capabilities and not other criteria in decision-making, and the difficulty of applying the method with a large number of alternatives. To improve the study, other flexible numerical analysis tools and methods can be incorporated. Additionally, the study was conducted in the context of emerging economies, so more studies in different countries are needed to develop a broad understanding of the topic. A prospective research scope could be determining the feasibility of various renewable energy sources in different countries.","implications for sustainability spandan basak payel, s.m. faysal ahmed department of mechanical engineering bangladesh university of engineering and technology, dhaka 1000, bangladesh. spandanbasak@gmail.com, smfaysalahmed@gmail.com md. zahidul anam, md. tanvir siraj department of industrial and production engineering bangladesh university of engineering and technology, dhaka 1000, bangladesh. zahidulmahedi@gmail.com, tanvir25392@gmail.com",

Where these risks are contained in the planning and execution process. So, it is necessary to map the risks in each process and stage of work so that the type of risk, probability value, and impact value can be known so that the risk level is made. Furthermore, the project can avoid the emergence of impacts and minimize the risks that occur so that the risk level can decrease.

264,86 Service Efficiency Analysis Of The Outpatient Department  (Opd) Of A Public Hospital In The Philippines By Service,"the time spent on the queue to get consulted by a doctor affects the patient’s satisfaction on the services provided by a hospital. just like in the opd of a public hospital in the philippines, the researchers have observed poor queueing system where some patients are dissatisfied. to provide solutions to the existing problem, the researchers utilized servqual scale, five quality dimensions: tangibles, reliability, responsiveness, assurance, and empathy to assess service quality. queueing theory and promodel process simulation were also used to analyze the current queueing system and propose new layout. the result obtained shows a negative gap exists between the expectation and the observation of the patients with the service of the opd in each dimension, which are tangibles (-0.4733), reliability (- 0.2311), responsiveness (-0.1675), assurance (-0.3289), and empathy (-0.2258). in implementing the proposed layout, the results obtained were an 86% increase in the number of patients accommodated, a decrease of 40%, 6%, and 46% in the average time of patients in the system, in operation, and in the waiting time of patients, respectively, compared to the existing process. it has been demonstrated that the recommended layout model can improve the hospital's service quality while cutting down patient waiting time.","servqual scale, queuing theory","Based on the survey results and observations, the service provided by the hospital's OPD did not meet the patients’ expectations in the various dimensions of the SERVQUAL scales. The expectations of patients were proven to be higher than what the patients had experienced. On the other hand, although the dimensions equally affected the quality of service provided by the hospital, the patients had high expectations for the reliability dimension. However, responsiveness got the highest score after they experienced the service in the OPD. Meanwhile, the dimension with the lowest mean score for both the expected and observed values is the tangibles dimension and the dimension that the hospital should prioritize to increase the satisfaction of patients with their service. The researchers identified medicine availability as the reason this dimension received a lower score than the others. Additionally, the delay in the release of laboratory results was found to be an attribute with which the patients were not satisfied. The process identified nurse triage as the main bottleneck of the operation. Most patients spend more time in this process, while the next patients, since the hospital has a “first-come, first-served” policy, need to wait for their turn in the triage. The average wait time for patients before receiving the service that they required was determined to be three hours. Overall, they need to stay in the system for more than 4 hours, including their time in operation. The main issue in the OPD has been identified as a lack of healthcare workers, which is why patients must wait longer for the services they require. By imposing the proposed process layout and having additional health workers, the researchers were able to determine the difference between the existing and proposed layout in terms of the patient's time and state in the system. It is found that there is an 86% increase in the total number of patients that the OPD can accommodate under the proposed system. Also, there is a 40%, 6%, and 46% decrease in the time of patients in the system, in operations, and in waiting. According to the current state of the patients, there is a 101% increase in the percentage of patients who are moving in logic, a 57% increase in the percentage of patients who are in operation, and a 26% decrease in the percentage of patients who are waiting.","quality model and queuing theory essey misaki v. andres, franz c. dator, pamela rose a. juan, joeyette therese e. macato, john carl r. mendevil industrial engineering department technological institute of the philippines – manila memvandres@tip.edu.ph, mfcdator@tip.edu.ph, mprajuan@tip.edu.ph mjtemacato@tip.edu.ph, mjcrmendevil@tip.edu.ph janina elyse a. reyes industrial engineering department - adviser technological institute of the philippines jereyes.ie@tip.edu.ph",

The dataset gathered for this study can be used to explore many other different NLP tasks for the Filipino language. Image-conditional language generation and text-conditional image generation in particular are two NLP tasks that this dataset has made possible that wasn’t feasible to explore before with the current datasets. This research along with the dataset intends to aid future work on NLP with Filipino and other low-resource languages.","kenrick lance t. buñag student of bs computer science program college of computer studies, angeles university foundation angeles city, philippines kenricklance092@gmail.com rosanna a. esquivel professor of computer science college of computer studies, angeles university foundation angeles city, philippines esquivel.rosanna@auf.edu.ph",

We considered secondary school enrollment and GDP as the indicators for the factors, and the results show that SE negatively and significantly impacts renewable energy consumption. Also, the results show that when the GDP increases, then REC also decreases which means GDP has a negative impact on REC. The regression analysis results show that the cubic regression model is the best model that can be used to explain the REC by SE compared to the other nonlinear regression models. Similarly, the cubic regression model with log transformation of the independent variable is the best fit for the REC based on the GDP. This study is limited to 2 variables. Although these variables impact renewable energy consumption, the R2 values and model results show that new variables should be added to the models.","nilüfer pekin alakoça,*, melinda oroszlányováa, hedi mhallaa, noureyah mahmoud yaseen alrasa a college of engineering and technology american university of the middle east, kuwait melinda.oroszlanyova@aum.edu.kw (mo), hedi.mhalla@aum.edu.kw (hm), 50905@aum.edu.kw (nmya) * correspondence: nilufer.alakoc@aum.edu.kw",

274,Economic And Long-Term Impacts Of Free Trade  Agreements (Ftas) With The U.S.A.,"in the world trade organization (wto) agreements, united states has continued to enforce trade agreements with many countries through the world trade organization (wto), with 14 of the 20 countries being active participants in these agreements. free trade agreements (ftas) have grown in importance as essential trade agreements that facilitate trade negotiations among member countries. these ftas could have a wide range of positive effects, including the ability to strengthen a country's overall economy and open new economic opportunities. whether they support or oppose trade agreements, economists can agree that they are good for the economy. trade agreements, in a brief, are the ""rules of the road"" that guide american companies on how to do international business while simultaneously defending american interests and utilizing international trade regulations. according to recent data, the us has continued to enter trade deals with several other countries, including the uk, mexico, and canada. one of the most important trade agreements for the us in recent years is the united states-mexico-canada agreement (usmca), which replaced the north american free trade agreement (nafta) provides a crucial framework for commercial relations with these neighboring nations. the trans-pacific partnership (tpp) and the transatlantic trade and investment partnership (ttip), two other recent trade deals, intended to improve trade ties between countries in the pacific rim and the european union, respectively. businesses in the united states can sign a variety of trade agreements, including free trade agreements, agreements with the world trade organization, suspension agreements, bilateral investment treaties, agreements on intellectual property rights, trade agreement guides, and the florence agreement program. the purpose of this paper is to provide valuable insights into the benefits and drawbacks of these trade agreements and their long-term effects on the us economy and future generations.",trade agreements,"In general, the evidence indicates that FTAs have benefited the American economy. They have contributed to lower prices for American consumers and have boosted growth and employment. Better policies ought to be implemented by political parties in order for these benefits to continue. Due to different views on trade agreements, this is still uncertain. As a result of trade negotiations and open trading agreements, member nations have seen economic, political, and production growth. By examining the overall effects of FTAs with the United States, this study contributes to the existing body of research on the topic. The United States of America and its allies have demonstrated economic and political expansion, as well as an increase in imports and commodities. The impact on a smaller business in the economy and the formation of a group of opponents are key outcomes here. We have observed that, in the grand scheme of things, free trade regulations benefit the majority of businesses, and smaller businesses can pivot or expand to maintain market relevance. Trade agreements are a crucial tool for nations seeking to promote prosperity and economic growth. To balance the interests of all parties, they must be properly developed. By its participation in organizations such as the World Trade Organization and the North American Free Trade Agreement, the United States has been a pioneer in advocating free trade. It will be essential for nations to keep cooperating to develop trade policies that are advantageous to all parties as the global economy develops. Dealing with issues related to environmental and labor standards is one of the major difficulties in FTA negotiations. FTAs have the potential to enhance economy, but there is also a chance that they may lead to worsening labor conditions and environmental deterioration. To address these issues, there has been an increasing focus on including labor and environmental measures in recent years. For instance, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) has clauses that protect the environment and the rights of workers by, among other things, mandating Mexico to tighten its labor laws and undertake pollution control measures. By addressing social and environmental issues, these clauses can ensure that FTAs encourage sustainable and equitable growth. FTAs have emerged as a popular mechanism for enhancing economic growth and fostering closer political ties between countries. While some of these agreements primarily focus on boosting trade and the economy, others are aimed at improving diplomatic relations between nations. Future research on this topic should examine the impact of such agreements both before and after their implementation, taking into account political changes that could affect their success. It is important to assess which industries stand to benefit the most from these agreements, to identify potential areas of growth and expansion. For example, the United States has recently shown an increased interest in executing trade agreements with smaller nations. Such agreements hold promise for the future of economic growth and closer political ties within the United States and its partners. However, the success of these agreements is often contingent upon the prevailing government's political stance, making it imperative to consider the broader political context when evaluating their impact. To fully understand the effects of these agreements on economic growth and diplomatic relations, more research is necessary to assess their effectiveness in different regions and industries. Policymakers can use these insights to make informed decisions and ensure that free trade agreements promote sustainable economic growth and foster closer political ties between nations.","naim islam and pawan bhandari department of automotive and manufacturing engineering technology minnesota state university mankato, mn 56001, usa naim.islam@mnsu.edu; pawan.bhandari.2@mnsu.edu",

276,Conventional And Exergetic Life Cycle Assessment Process  And Applications Of,"this study presents the life cycle assessment of various power generation technologies based. the assessments cover impacts from extraction, processing and transportation of fuels, construction of power plants and power generation. life-cycle assessment (lca) to power generation technologies is very useful as the world seeks ways to meet growing electricity demand with less health and environmental impacts. lca is an evolving methodology with several barriers and challenges but has helped in improving the understanding of the lifecycle energy, greenhouse gas emissions, air pollutant emissions, and water-use implications to power generation. the application of lca tools facilitates an analytically thorough and environmentally holistic approach in assessment and comparison of power generation technologies. most lcas show that the best power plants are hydropower, both run-of-river and with reservoir, nuclear energy, and wind power. fuel combustion directly leads to emissions and potential environmental harm. the cradle-to-grave approach considers all steps between material and fuel extraction from the environment until they are returned to the environment. the methodology used in lifecycle assessment (lca) includes the effects of all the production phases, use and recycling on the environment. the complete lca involves factors like water and air pollution, and noise. exergy which is the maximum useful work that can be extracted from a system as it reversibly comes into equilibrium is used in various fields such as industrial ecology and environmental engineering, for efficient use of energy and to minimize harmful environmental impacts. exergy analysis has been in application since the late 1990s and is extended into the realm of resource and environmental analysis, to develop integrated analytical frameworks. exergy analysis can be used in decision-making by policy makers in making sustainable choices. key words: energy payback ratio; emissions factor; exergy assessment; greenhouse gas emission; lifecycle assessment; lca; sustainability assessment. 1. introduction energy is an essential resource for modern society used for many applications like lighting, transport, communication, heating, air conditioning, manufacturing among others. the evaluation of energy production technologies considers all aspects like energy and raw-materials consumptions, energy efficiency, and environmental impacts must be considered. the environmental impact is an important factor in the evaluation of power generation technologies(petrescu et al., 2017). electricity systems account for 38% of primary energy use globally and are set to rapidly grow as demand for electricity-based services increases such as looking, lighting, sanitation, heating and cooling, and information and communications. the current global electricity mix is dominated by fossil fuels led by coal, natural gas, nuclear, and petroleum which are all nonrenewable (edenhofer et al., 2013; moses j. b. kabeyi & oludolapo a. olanrewaju, 2022). assessment tools like the life cycle assessment (lca), exergy analysis (exa), and emergy analysis (ema) are used to account for sustainability indicators in social, environmental, and economic, dimensions, and hence are applied to carry out assessments under these three dimensions (cano-londoño et al., 2022). life cycle assessment (lca) is a holistic approach applied in evaluating the environmental impacts of products and systems through their entire life. life cycle analysis is needed to foster the development of energy technologies in a sustainable manner (moses jeremiah barasa kabeyi & oludolapo akanni olanrewaju, 2022c; paredes et al., 2019). life cycle assessment (lca) is a decision support tool which assesses environmental burdens of products and processes right from materials extraction to disposal popularly referred to as cradle-to-grave or even cradle-to-cradle. for accuracy, the power generation life cycle assessments should better characterize spatial and temporal characteristics(jordaan et proceedings of the international conference on industrial engineering and operations management manila, philippines, march 7-9, 2023 © ieom society international 2738",,,"moses jeremiah barasa kabeyi mkabeyi@uonbi.ac.ke industrial engineering department, durban university of technology, durban south africa oludolapo akanni.olanrewaju oludolapoo@dut.ac.za industrial engineering department, durban university of technology, durban south africa correspondence to: moses jeremiah barasa kabeyi: mkabeyi@uonbi.ac.ke",
277,Cost And Performance Of Grid Scale Energy Storage Options   Moses Jeremiah Barasa Kabeyi,"energy storage systems provide an important solution for improving the reliability of electricity networks due to challenges of integrating intermittent electricity from variable sources like wind and solar. factors considered in the selection of storage batteries are cost and performance since. prices for every kwh injected into the network and battery energy storage system (bess) costs vary. energy storage systems play an important role in improving the reliability of electricity networks due to increasing contribution of electricity from intermittent sources like wind and solar. the main considerations in choosing a suitable storage system are cost and performance. since the price for every kwh supplied to the network and battery energy storage system (bess) costs are dynamic, consumers interested in a battery may have challenges in choosing between the various batteries available in the market. this study presents a the levelized cost of storage as a suitable method or approach for selecting the most suitable battery technology for household and industrial consumers. the future power plants are expected to have large proportions of intermittent energy sources like. wind, solar or tidal energy that require scale-up of energy storage to match the supply with hourly, daily, and seasonal electricity demand profiles. available storage technologies include batteries, pumped hydroelectricity storage, compressed air energy storage and power-to-gas storage. the energy transition to renewable energy supply calls for increased application of energy storage. identification of optimal solutions requires a holistic view of the energy system beyond the electricity-only focus. in this study, an integrated cross-sector approach is adopted to identify the most efficient and least-cost storage options for off grid and grid scale application. key words: electricity price; battery energy storage system;energy storage;: lead-carbon batteries; lifecycle cost of energy; lithium-ion batteries; levelized cost of storage 1. introduction the global increase in use of small-scale and distributed generation, and use of variable renewable have led to high demand for electrical energy storage systems (ess), which applies different storage device. they include electrochemical storages, super capacitors, gravity batteries etc. the challenge is that we have no universally accepted economic indicator which for use in comparing compare different energy storage systems unlike in power plant planning where “levelized cost of electricity (lcoe)” has been accepted(melnikov et al., 2018). combining storage and renewable in a power system improves flexibility, which promotes adoption of renewable energy by ensuring security of the power grid. the future energy systems dominated by renewable energy will require largescale and wide application of energy storage technologies (xu et al., 2022). grid-scale energy storage has an important role to play in the net zero emissions target by the year 2050 scenario by providing services ranging from short-term balancing and operating reserves, provision of ancillary services for grid stability and deferment of capital investment in capacity increase and power distribution system extension, long- term energy storage and grid restoration after blackouts. there are various types of energy storage systems with pumped-storage hydropower being the most widely used storage technology. with total installed capacity of about 160 gw in 2021. its global capability was about 8 500 gwh in 2020, which accounted for about 90% of total global proceedings of the international conference on industrial engineering and operations management manila, philippines, march 7-9, 2023 © ieom society international 2756",,"Energy storage systems provide an important solution for improving the reliability of electricity networks due to challenges of integrating intermittent electricity from variable sources like wind and solar. Factors considered in the selection of storage batteries are cost and performance since. prices for every kWh injected into the network and battery energy storage system (BESS) costs vary. Energy storage systems play an important role in improving the reliability of electricity networks due to increasing contribution of electricity from intermittent sources like wind and solar. Levelized cost of storage (LCOS) refers to the cost of kWh or MWh electricity discharged by a storage device when accounting for the entire costs incurred, and energy generated throughout the lifetime of the storage device. Energy storage is a high-quality flexible resource, with an important regulatory role in a high increasing the uptake of variable and intermittent renewable energy resources. The various elements of Levelized cost of storage are the Capex, Opex, charging cost, tax cost, replacement cost, and end-of-life cost. From the cost breakdown, it is indicated that the proportion of Capex and charging cost is the largest, while the proportion of tax cost and Opex is the smallest. Batteries with a short life cycle and many replacements have the highest cost. Levelized cost of storage varies with different application scenarios e.g., for transmission and distribution applications LCOS is the lowest when lithium iron phosphate batteries ae used because the batteries only need one replacement thus take advantage long life.

278,Environmental Impact Of Energy Resources   Moses Jeremiah Barasa Kabeyi,"energy production has several direct environmental challenges which include climate change, air pollution, water pollution, land contamination, thermal/heat pollution, and solid waste disposal. energy related air pollution is a major environmental challenge facing urban areas. fuel combustion leads directly to emissions and potential environmental harm, while use of electricity does not lead directly to environmental impacts, but its production from fuels leads to emits significant quantities of greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental impacts. however, if electricity is produced from renewable and low carbon sources like wind turbines , solar photovoltaic cells and nuclear has limited direct emissions compared to fossil fuels. assessment of environmental impacts of energy carriers considers processes from resource extraction, its conversion into secondary energy carriers, consumption, and waste disposal or recycling. the cradle-to-grave approach captures all steps between extracting materials and fuels from the environment until and their returned to the environment. the attainment of decarburization targets and keeping global warming below 2°c threshold requires well-informed energy policy design. low-carbon electricity supply for all needed to attain the 2°c- compatible energy system, will entail electrification of most of our economy. life cycle assessment facilitates evaluation of a product over its life cycle, and across various environmental indicators. energy resources and technologies for power generation are a mix of renewable and nonrenewable e.g. coal, natural gas, hydropower, nuclear power, concentrated solar power (csp), photovoltaics, and wind power. life cycle assessment is a tool used to evaluate the environmental impact of energy sources. one major limitation of the standard life cycle assessment methodology is that it ignores the impact of the impact of greenhouse gases. life-cycle impacts decrease substantially when current fossil fuel technologies diminish in the energy mix, particularly coal. natural gas use may play an important role during the transition while installation of new fossil options without co2 capture should be avoided to minimize emissions. the endogenous integration of life-cycle indicators into energy models adds value to both life cycle assessment and energy systems modelling in their support in energy decision as well as policymaking for sustainable energy transition. key words: greenhouse gas emissions; life cycle assessment; greenhouse gas emissions; energy sources. 1. introduction globally, countries are devising low carbon energy and electricity policies as a result of the double constraint of depleting fossil resources and climate change from greenhouse gas emissions. the intergovernmental panel on climate change (ipcc) identified electrification of the global economy combined with the rapid decarbonization of the grid as a key option to reduce greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions and keep global warming under 1.5°c or 2°c. the energy related activities ranging from extraction, conversion, intermediate and final use, are responsible for three quarters of greenhouse gas emissions with most of it coming from combustion of oil. gas, and coal in power generation(garcía-gusano et al., 2016). it is important to note that the physical bounds of planet earth are finite with growing need for resources leading to environmental and social concerns. these issues include high level greenhouse gas emissions, climate change, water scarcity, pollution, human health, and land use. coping measures should focus on reducing consumption of nonrenewable resources and verification of their suitability in terms of sustainability. this is linked to the energy transformation processes taking place under these circumstances. by combining energy systems modelling (esm) and life cycle assessment (lca) methodologies produces research field for both analysts and energy planners(garcía-gusano et al., 2016; junne et al., 2021). a key step forward involves the endogenous integration of life-cycle indicators into energy system management (esm) which is based robust optimization procedures(garcía-gusano et al., 2016). proceedings of the international conference on industrial engineering and operations management manila, philippines, march 7-9, 2023 © ieom society international 2768",,"The attainment of decarburization targets and keeping global warming below 2°C threshold requires well-informed energy policy design. Low-carbon electricity supply for all needed to attain the 2°C-compatible energy system, will entail electrification of most of our economy. Life cycle assessment facilitates evaluation of a product over its life cycle, and across various environmental indicators. Technologies assessed include coal, natural gas, hydropower, nuclear power, concentrated solar power (CSP), photovoltaics, and wind power. Life cycle assessment is a tool used to evaluate the environmental impact of energy sources. One major limitation of the standard life cycle assessment methodology is that it ignores the impact of the impact of greenhouse gases. Life-cycle impacts decrease substantially when current fossil fuel technologies diminish in the energy mix, particularly coal. Natural gas use may play an important role during the transition while installation of new fossil options without CO2 capture should be avoided to minimize emissions. The endogenous integration of life-cycle indicators into energy models adds value to both life cycle assessment and energy systems modelling in their support in energy decision as well as policymaking for sustainable energy transition. Total life cycle GHG emissions from nuclear power and renewable energy resources are lower and generally less variable than those of fossil fuels. The cradle to grave, coal-fired electricity produces about 20 times more GHGs per kilowatt-hour than solar, wind, and nuclear electricity based on median estimates for each technology. Renewable energy and low carbon energy sources play an important development of sustainable electricity system. The study demonstrates that renewable power has a great advantage over thermal power, among which traditional hydropower has the lowest GHG intensity. Solar PV power generation has a lower GHG intensity in high-radiation areas such as, wind power has more advantages in coastal areas and some areas with rich wind resources. The deployment of wind turbines and solar contribute to the climate impact of power generation. A significant reduction in life cycle GHG emissions is realized by deployment of wind offshore, CSP and nuclear power. Additionally, nuclear is a reliable base-load power plant with capacity factor greater than 0.9 but can easily cause considerable cost increases by up to 63% higher than possible minimum cost solution. Hydrogen can play a leading role in life cycle peak load supply as life cycle emissions of the power system continue to diminish. Although renewable energy sources have some environmental impacts, they compare favorably to fossil fuel sources and therefore they remain key to the energy transition.","mkabeyi@uonbi.ac.ke industrial engineering department, durban university of technology, durban south africa oludolapo akanni.olanrewaju oludolapoo@dut.ac.za industrial engineering department, durban university of technology, durban south africa correspondence to: moses jeremiah barasa kabeyi: mkabeyi@uonbi.ac.ke",
279,Electricity Generation Costs By Technology  Moses Jeremiah Barasa Kabeyi *,"the cost of power generation and related technology is an important dimension of energy sustainability since it affects the final price of electricity, choice of technology mix and overall sustainability of the power system. levelized cost is a simple metric hence widely used to compute the unit cost of power generated from power generation technologies. limitation of the metric includes lack of consideration for key parameters like inflation, power integration costs, and system costs whose integration would provide a more comprehensive metric for evaluating power generation projects, and the entire power system. the study showed that the levelized costs of electricity generation for the low carbon technologies have reduced significantly and are now cost competitive with the conventional fossil fuel generation technologies although specific costs are country specific. it was demonstrated that large solar power plants supply cheaper power compared to onshore wind, coal power plants and natural gas power, although it may vary in some factors based on local condition since various factors affect the cost of generation from one place to another. the capital cost of power plants varies widely based on technology as well as within same technology. fuel cells have the highest capital cost among power plants investigated followed by offshore wind and advanced nuclear power plants. gas turbines have some of the lowest capital costs. noted that the average price of unit cost of renewable sources namely small pv, largescale pv, onshore and offshore wind as well as biogas has been on a declining trend over the last decade. on the other hand, the average unit price of fossil fuel sources i.e., natural gas, hard coal and lignite coal has been growing. nuclear, which is a clean non fossil fuel experienced growth in unit price of power which may affect its competitiveness in the energy transition. key words: electricity price; levelized cost of energy; electricity generation; life cycle cost; generation planning; power generation; sustainability; sustainable energy 1. introduction power generation technologies incur a variety of different costs that can be divided into ,three general categories namely wholesale costs which are costs paid by utilities in acquiring and distributing electricity, retail costs which paid by electricity consumers, and external costs, or externalities, which are costs imposed by the society or community(m. j. b. kabeyi & a. o. olanrewaju, 2022) . the levelized cost of electricity (lcoe) is a techno- economic parameter used to describe the unit cost of power generated from a selected power plants by taking into account costs like initial investment, operation and maintenance costs among others for an objective comparison of energy sources(elisa veronese et al., 2021). the main drivers for electricity generating costs are the construction, fuel costs, co2 emissions costs, and operation and maintenance costs. these factors are influenced by the size of the units used, hence the effect of economies of scale which tend to reduce unit costs for larger units. even though wind turbines and solar pv ae modular in nature, there is significant cost reduction developed in wind or and solar farms(international energy agency, 2020). the levelized cost of energy (lcoe), or levelized cost of electricity, is used to measure the lifetime cost of energy generation or production by a given system. the lcoe facilitates the comparison of costs associated with various forms of energy. the metric is applied to determine the average cost of producing one kilowatt hour (kwh) of electricity over the generating asset lifetime. lcoe computes costs associated with a system like installation, operation, maintenance, and fuel costs all presented as a single figure. it is very straightforward and easy to understand and apply in comparing various energy sources and technologies (hoymiles, 2020; m. kabeyi & o. olanrewaju, 2021). proceedings of the international conference on industrial engineering and operations management manila, philippines, march 7-9, 2023 © ieom society international 2782",,,"22064693@dut4life.ac.za; moseskabeyi@yahoo.com industrial engineering department, durban university of technology, durban south africa oludolapo akanni olanrewaju oludolapoo@dut.ac.za industrial engineering department, durban university of technology, durban south africa *corresponding author, contacts: 22064693@dut4life.ac.za; moseskabeyi@yahoo.com",
280,Performance Analysis Of Garissa Off-Grid Power Station   Moses Jeremiah Barasa Kabeyi *,"off grid power generation options offer a cheaper and sustainable approach to electrify remote and rural communities. the main challenge associated with the use of a single technology is the danger of oversizing of the power systems at the project beginning hence high capital investment. other limitations are high greenhouse gas emissions and low system reliability. using a hybrid system and storage can overcome the intermittent nature of renewable energy sources and the problem of oversizing and improve the reliability of energy supply while at the same limiting the environmental impact related to use of fossil fuels. in this study, a performance analysis of garissa power station in kenya was done. the study showed the power station had 6 diesel engine generators with a total installed capacity of 4,257 kw and effective capacity of 1,950 kw against peak demand of between 3600 for garissa town at the time of the study. therefore, the town had a power deficit of 1650 kw during peak hours and therefore requires installed capacity of about 2053 kw (with engines availability factor of 80%) to meet the demand. however, based on the effective capacity factor, up to 3,587kw in new capacity was needed. this deficit was partially addressed temporarily by overhauling two engines of capacity 1064 kw that were out of service and which had been derated from a capacity 674 kw to 250 kw due to mechanical defects. th study showed that generation improved by 44 by overhaul of engines 1 and 2 even though the generation from engines 5& 6 diminished due to expiry of after sales service and hence delays in maintenance. the study demonstrated the importance of proper and timely maintenance of diesel engines for reliable power supply and challenges associated with use of single technology in power supply for off grid systems.","emergency power, off grid power, power generation","The power station under the study had 6 diesel engine generators with a total installed capacity of 4,257 kW and effective capacity of 1,950 kW against peak demand of between 3600 for Garissa Town at the time of the study. Therefore, the town had a power deficit of 1650 kW during peak hours and therefore requires installed capacity of about 2053 kW (with engines availability factor of 80%) to meet the demand. However, based on the effective capacity factor, up to 3,587kW in new capacity was needed. This demand could be met by repairing Engine 1 with capacity of 1064 kW which was on forced outage, Engine 2 of capacity 674 kW which had been derated to 250 kW, and the engines 5 and 6 also performing below optimum capacity. This could solve the problem in the short term. However, as a long-term measure extra capacity from the new generation is needed to take care of emergencies and the ever- growing demand. The main challenge facing Garissa power station is the use of a single technology which generally leads to oversizing of the power systems at the start of the project hence high capital investment. Other limitations are high greenhouse gas emissions and low system reliability. Using a hybrid system and storage can overcome the intermittent nature of renewable energy sources and the problem of oversizing and improve the reliability of energy supply while at the same limiting the environmental impact related to use of fossil fuels. This study demonstrated the serious challenges resulting from use of diesel generators as single energy sources for the off grid power and the significance of proper and timely maintenance of engine prime movers for power plants to guarantee reliability and capacity in power generation.","mkabeyi@yahoo.com industrial engineering department, durban university of technology, durban south africa oludolapo akanni olanrewaju oludolapoo@dut.ac.za industrial engineering department, durban university of technology, durban south africa *corresponding author, contacts: moseskabeyi@yahoo.com; mkabeyi@uonbi.ac.ke",
281,Design And Evaluation Of Aquaponics System,"aquaponics is a food production method that combines hydroponic and aquaculture to form a system. a fish tank for the aquaponics system and non-aquaponics system was constructed, the start up and running the system was monitored for 4 months. the fish grown in the fish tank and the plants grown in the pot with pebbles and supplied with local water. electric energy use for water pumps was measured to reach close to 5.76 kw-hr per month per container. the fish growth was monitored and found that the fish in aquaponics system gained more weight than the fish in non-aquaponics system. the plants growth was monitored also and found that the plants gained more weight in aquaponics system than in non-aquaponics system as well as the water temperature monitored and found that the water temperature in aquaponics system is less than the non-aquaponics system. from the results in this study, aquaponics system seem to be higher in fish growth in weight, higher in plants growth in weight and less in water temperature. continued studies would do well to investigate plant growth using soil as well as physical properties of water for fish growth.","aquaponics system, growth, fish growth",,ike a. baguio cebu technological university – main campus email address: ike.baguio@ctu.edu.ph raul b. gunitaran cebu technological university – main campus email address: raul.guinitaran@ctu.edu.ph dyanne brendalyn m. cavero cebu technological university – main campus email address:dyannebrendayn.cavero@ctu.edu.ph,
282,The Future Of Automation In Human-Based Manufacturing:  The Case For Manufacturing In South Africa,"the fourth industrial revolution (4ir) has brought with it an excess of possibilities for automation within various industry sectors. the 4ir will be achieved by using technology to change the way of life, to change how products/services are produced/provided by manufacturers and to change the mechanics of globalization significantly if not completely. this new way of life will see many occupations being replaced by automation while completely new ones are created. in the south african context, there is evidence from the banking sector where, occupations that previously required human consultants for customer queries have been replaced with self-service platforms for consumers. this phenomenon has led some big companies in sa have plans to close down their call center departments. additional reports on 4ir point to the unfortunate eventuality of job losses in the auditing, legal and health industries just to name a few. this paper looks into the future of this advanced wave of automation in the context of the south african manufacturing sector. it examines the subject of automation in manufacturing in south africa, a means to gauge the state of automation compared to global competitors. the intention was to determine how this automation has been implemented on a global scale and how this has eventually affected the human operator. the necessary pre-conditions for automation have been investigated. their linkages with the levels of automation were examined.","automation, robotics, manufacturing",,"hilda kundai chikwanda, ph.d. associate professor department of engineering and technology management, university of pretoria, pretoria, south africa hilda.chikwanda@up.ac.za lesedi mokgatlhe masters student department of engineering and technology management, university of pretoria, pretoria, south africa lesmok011@gmail.com","References

To increase the effectiveness of their returns management, the organizations must concentrate on these. The instances involving Amazon and Apple demonstrate how mishandled returns result in unnecessary dumps and environmental risks. For the enterprises, effective collection and processing are essential. For instance, Amazon has made Kiva robots available for effective dump sorting. Case studies demonstrate that effective returns management also generates goodwill and value. Apple is committed to safeguarding the environment, the health and safety of its employees and customers, as well as the entire world from environmental dangers. Since then, the company has removed the poisons from its products, making it the first laptop maker to do so.

285,Inventory Management System Of Seasonal Raw Materials  Of Feeds At San Jose Batangas Through Integer Linear,"the branch of business management that deals with inventory planning and control is known as inventory management. it comprises keeping track of supply levels and forecasting demand, as well as scheduling when and how to plan. keeping excess inventory results in a loss of money takes up physical space, and raises the risk of damage, spoilage, and loss. on the other hand, too little inventory frequently causes operations to be disrupted and raises the possibility of low customer satisfaction, both of which can be detrimental to a company's reputation. the united victorious feed mill corporation's present inventory management practices were assessed in terms of inventory level, warehouse allocation, ordering frequency, shelf life, and production requirement. to help the company achieve their optimal level of inventory, a mathematical model was created using integer linear programming. due to the season, the goal function was to reduce the cost of purchasing us soya and yellow corn. warehouse space, annual production requirements, and shelf life were all considered. to ensure that the user only uses one application to record all relevant information, like production output and delivery, the researcher built a visual basic system. additionally, the technology allows management to change the model's parameters.",,"The level of inventory, warehouse allocation, ordering frequency, shelf life, and production requirements were used to assess the company’s present inventory management position. The researcher discovered that the company used to keep a safety stock sufficient for three weeks of production. The warehouse allocation was also determined by measuring the actual size of raw material packaging. The company also used to order every three weeks, which equated to 17 orders per raw material regardless of season. Each raw material is considered good for production even if it is stocked for 6 months, especially if it is of high quality. Finally, the number of raw materials to be stocked was determined by the monthly requirement, which is 18,000 bags of feed mill. A mathematical model was developed using Integer Linear Programming to assist the company in achieving their optimal level of inventory. The goal function was to reduce the cost of purchasing US Soya and Yellow Corn due to the season. Warehouse space, yearly production requirements, and shelf life were all considered. This model also restricts all decision variables to integers, ensuring that all orders are exact numbers of sacks. The decisions that will be made will be equivalent to the quantity of raw materials per order. To reduce the number of repetitive computations in solving linear programming, a Microsoft macro was used. A Visual Basic system was also offered by the researcher to make sure that the user only needs to utilize one program to record all relevant data, such as production output and deliveries. The system also allows the management to modify the model whenever the parameters change. The researcher explained the system to the business owner. Owners like the method because it allows them to keep track of their employees' progress and reduces the need for repetitive tasks. However, because the company is currently preparing for the relocation of company buildings, actual testing of the system is not possible. The researcher concluded that this system will be useful because it will be simple to change the parameters because of their recent acquisition of a larger warehouse and new building. The proposed system will be used to monitor the raw materials of the feed mill; however, the system will not be used to determine the quality status. As a result, stocking and using raw materials will have no effect on the model's output. For further research, the system can be modified by incorporating all raw materials, allowing the company to monitor all ingredients and reduce manual inventory.","programming and vba glenda marie b. napa professor of industrial engineering college of information technology and engineering de la salle lipa, lipa city, batangas, philippines glenda.marie.napa@dlsl.edu.ph",

290,The Sustainability Of Halal Supply Chain In Japan:  Perspectives Of Halal Certification Bodies (Hcbs),"with the tremendous growth of the halal industry, many non-dominant muslim countries particularly japan, have shown interest to tap into the halal market. to ensure the availability of halal products, therefore, it is crucial to have a comprehensive and well-managed halal supply chain. integrating both “halal” (permissible) and “tayyib” (wholesome) throughout all the phases in the supply chain indicates that halal-certified companies need to comply with certain sustainability practices which are aligned with the halal certification systems. nevertheless, there is always curiosity among the customers on the halal integrity across the supply chain and they will feel more confident if the products are halal certified. apparently, halal certification bodies played a significant role to enhance the sustainable performance measures in the halal supply chain. currently, there are more than 30 halal certification bodies (hcbs) in japan. their backgrounds are diverse from muslim local residents and community members in japanese cities and individual muslim academics specializing in agriculture and food systems, to japanese businesspersons who are familiar with islamic countries and religious organizations. despite the vast opportunities, inevitably there are numerous challenges faced by the hcbs that may influence the sustainability of the halal supply chain in japan. hence, this motivates this paper to explore the management of the halal certification process and how it may affect halal supply chain sustainability. based on the in-depth interviews with 5 established hcbs, this paper aims to explore the sustainable practices and the challenges in the halal supply chain that may contribute to the betterment of the halal industry in japan.","halal industry, sustainability, halal supply chain",,"norlena hasnan university utara malaysia kuala lumpur 41-3, jalan raja muda abdul aziz, 50300 kuala lumpur, malaysia norlena@uum.edu.my youji kohda school of knowledge science japan advanced institute of science and technology 1-chōme-1 asahidai, nomi, ishikawa 923-1211 japan kohda@jaist.ac.jp",

292,Approaches In Evaluating Hospital Wayfinding Signage  System: A Literature Review,"designing an effective wayfinding system is very crucial in a hospital. many hospitals in developing countries like the philippines create increasing pressure on patients when no proper signage is to be followed in times of emergencies. wayfinding signages aim to provide patients with correct directions without extensive explanations or complex maps. the purpose of this paper is to present a literature review on different hospital wayfinding signage system evaluation methodologies that may be necessary to establish a standard assessment guide. a comprehensive search using google scholar is applied to identify initially relevant studies. there is a total of 1, 780 articles identified from the search for the last ten years (2012-2022). the review found a trend in the evaluation of hospital signages, including the types of signages evaluated, design elements considered, and evaluation methods. the conclusion highlights the need for future research to establish methods that consider multiple design elements for improved hospital signage design.",design elements,"and Recommendations The concerns of hospital stakeholders such as patients and visitors regarding their wayfinding experience continue to exist. One of the contributing factors to this wayfinding experience is the effectiveness of hospital signages. To continue to improve on the effectiveness, several studies pursued different approaches in evaluating hospital signage considering the different types and different design elements. Due to research limitations, some studies can only consider two or three elements in the evaluation. Because of this, hospital signages are improved only by some aspects of the design but not the whole. This approach only leads the design to myopic improvement which would require future changes as new design elements are evaluated and found to be unsatisfactory. With this, it can be concluded that it is still relevant to establish methods that can consider multiple design elements to provide a more suitable design improvement. Other areas of study that researchers could explore are the determination of the importance of design elements based on the type of signage, and the further study of other approaches in evaluating signage such as nodal analysis, and the PDSA method.

293,Packaging Design With Consumer Behavior Perspective:  A Literature Review,"consumers will perceive the impression of professionalism in packaging that the product quality is relatively good. packaging becomes an aspect that has an essential role for companies to implicitly explain the details of the products to be sold and as the main points that explain how consumers are interested in consuming because of the cognitive transformation process provided by packaging both in terms of color and other features. packaging has a broader reach than advertising and differentiates it from competitors. packaging promotes and drives purchasing decisions when purchasing and every time the product is used. packaging with different sizes can expand a product to new target markets or help overcome cost barriers. this paper discusses packaging and consumer behavior in response to existing packaging. so far, almost all manufacturers when making packaging designs are only based on studies conducted by these manufacturers without any customer involvement. by understanding consumer behavior, it is hoped that in the future the packaging design created will involve consumers by paying attention to the aspects needed and desired by consumers. so that the packaging design that will be produced can further increase the value of the product and increase consumer interest in purchasing a product.","packaging, consumers, cognitive, communication","Packaging contributes to competitive advantage to market products to consumers concerning strategic decision- making to make a purchase. Packaging is considered an essential component of communication activities with consumers during the product marketing process, ensuring it remains safe during the distribution process and is a safe place during the storage process. Good design, with a mix of matching colors and optimal use of materials, will be able to create packaging that consumers highly desire. Consumer behavior is dynamic, and consumers have rapidly changing desires, demanding the creation of packaging that can fulfill the desires of consumers both from the aspect of consumer needs and desires for existing packaging. The function of packaging as protection, fulfilling safety aspects, attractive appearance, high level of usability, and sustainable packaging is what consumers need. Meanwhile, some things that consumers want regarding packaging include packaging with good strength, moisture resistance, recyclable, writable surface, and lightweight. 2390",sutrisno doctoral program at department of industrial and systems engineering institut teknologi sepuluh nopember surabaya sutrisno.dollah@gmail.com i ketut gunarta department of industrial and systems engineering institut teknologi sepuluh nopember surabaya gunarta@ie.its.ac.id erwin widodo department of industrial and systems engineering institut teknologi sepuluh nopember surabaya erwin@ie.its.ac.id,"References

294,Towards Predicting Student’S Dropout In Higher Education  Using Supervised Machine Learning Techniques,"this paper is conducted to develop a system that can aid universities in tracking students' academic progress by accurately determining dropout rates using machine learning techniques. this has been done by collecting and organizing data into machine readable forms, using predictive methods that determines significant patterns and trends, constructing different models involving machine learning techniques: random forest, logistic regression, and neural network, for forecasting and predictions, and finally interpreting the statistical results of the model. after the evaluation, it has been concluded that the random forest achieved the highest accuracy of 95.00%, precision of 97.78%, and f1 score of 96.70%. despite these results, the researchers recommend developing a more interesting and engaging prototype gui and utilizing a more balanced and diverse dataset that will enable higher accuracy and deeper understanding of the results.","student dropout, algorithms","In the study among the three machine learning techniques the Random Forest Classifier had the highest accuracy, precision, and F1 scores, as well as the second highest recall value. Upon analyzing the data it showed that the researchers had implemented normalization on the data before feeding it to the model, both in training and evaluation. Moreover, the researchers also used the same, fitted normalizer from the training process in the evaluation process to ensure consistency. Unlike in the mother journal, normalization seems to only be applied in the data preparation during the training process. Given this scenario, it would be expected that the model may perceive significant differences in evaluation if input data is not normalized as to how the training data was normalized during the training process.","raven miguel m. capuno, chester juliane m. ferrer, brian troy l. manaloto, sean redd villafria college of computer studies angeles university foundation angeles city, philippines capuno.ravenmiguel@auf.edu.ph, ferrer.chesterjuliane@auf.edu.ph, , manaloto.briantroy@auf.edu.ph, villafria.seanredd@auf.edu.ph james a. esquivel college of computer studies, faculty angeles university foundation angeles city, philippines esquivel.james@auf.edu.ph",
295,Evaluation On Production Flow Using Line Balancing  Method To Increase The Production,"infrastructure development for gresik smelter project requires a substantial amount of precast spun piles. the current factory capacity of 50 piles/day does not meet the minimum project's daily needs of 80 piles/day. the current production line still shows an imbalance output on each existing work station, which caused a numerous problems such as delays, bottle necks and ineffective production flows leading to a reduction in production capacity. this study is conducted using the line balancing method, process activity mapping and root cause analysis. using this method, you can find out the existing conditions of each work station, understand the production flows and identify waste by grouping the stages of the production process into activities that are value added, non value added and necessary but non value added. the takt time value needed is 15 minutes/unit, the results of this study indicate there are 4 work stations with station time above takt time and have an nva value of 14.71%. after analyzing and improving the 5 research variables the nva value can be reduced to 4.58% and the overall station time has a value under 15 minutes/unit resulting on the fulfillment the target of 80 piles/day.","balancing, upgrades, capacity, production","The results of observation and data processing using the line balancing method show that there are currently 4 work stations on existing production process with station time exceeding 15 minutes/unit Takt Time, namely cutting, setting molding, casting and demoulding. Results from PAM and RCA analysis showed that the existing production line has a total operating time of 157.02 minutes, the value of activity time that has no added value (NVA)/delay is 17.71% due to problems with the 5 observed variables. The recommendations given were able to make the overall station time goes below the takt time of <15 minutes/unit, operating time to 135.03 minutes and reducing the NVA value to 4.58%. The results of the Line Efficiency (LE) calculation are 90.02% and the Smooth index (SI) value is 6.07. Thus, according to the calculation of production capacity, it is capable of producing a capacity of 80 piles/day as per planned output.

296,The Role Of Technological Innovations In Enabling  Circular Supply Chains: A Review,"in traditional linear supply chains, productions and consumptions follow the “take, make, use, dispose” approach. in this model, the growth is subject to the continuous consumption of resources that are assumed to be readily available. in such a linear economy, value creation is supported by making and selling products to the greatest extent possible. conversely, in a closed-loop circular supply chain, products do not simply become waste but are rather transformed into valuable resources presenting sustainable business opportunities. the 4th industrial revolution supported technologies are the primary enablers of circular strategies and business models in supply chains. this study aims to provide a comprehensive review of these innovative technologies to appraise their roles in facilitating such a transition into circular supply chains.","supply chain, digitalization, industry 4.0, circular economy",,"seyed mehdi zahraei school of business singapore university of social sciences, singapore zahraei@suss.edu.sg salman shooshtarian school of property, construction and project management rmit university, australia salman.shooshtarian@rmit.edu.au",
297,Addressing The Methodological Challenges Associated With  E-Waste Estimation,"e-waste management is a growing concern for governments across the globe, majorly because of its composition. e- waste contains both hazardous as well as precious metals. the hazardous metals pose a serious threat to the environment and human health if not disposed of properly. whereas precious metals such as gold, silver, platinum, and copper, could be recovered and reused, thus eliminating the need for virgin materials. additionally, rapid urbanisation, increasing consumer demand, and shorter product lifespan have led to an increase in the consumption of electrical and electronic equipment, which would ultimately become e-waste (duman et al. 2020). given the importance of e-waste, the concept of reverse logistics (rl) has increasingly gained the attention of policy-makers, decision-makers, and academicians in recent years (govindan et al. 2015). the rl aims to collect the end-of-life (eol) products from the end-user to recover or extract the materials or components from eol products which could re-enter the value chain. recovery or extraction could include remanufacturing, reuse, and recycling. moreover, unrecoverable and hazardous materials are disposed of or landfilled in an environmentally friendly manner (dev et al. 2020). scholars highlight that setting-up of an efficient and effective recovery network in the context of weee requires an accurate estimate of the quantity of e-waste generated in the past, present, and future. for example, an accurate estimate could help in deciding the location of collection centers for weee collection, technology and capacity needs of the remanufacturing and recycling facilities could be decided, and the determination of location-capacity of the landfill sites. thus, ensuring that hazardous materials do not directly or indirectly impact human health. although lack of information arising due to error in estimation plays an inevitable part in rl network design decision-making, efforts are needed to develop methods for improving forecasting accuracy and reducing errors. in this regard, the researchers have proposed various e-waste estimation methods ranging from simple material flow methods to non-parametric approaches to complex machine learning techniques. however, the choice of the weee estimation method, rather than being driven by the accuracy of the forecasting method, is more often driven by data availability. hence in this study, we focus on reviewing various e-waste estimation methods proposed so far. the objective is to provide an in-depth understanding of the estimation methods, their pros which are majorly driven by the data availability, and the cons arising as a result of assumptions. also, we shed some light on various sorts of data or proxies that could be used to make accurate weee predictions. therefore, this article, by providing an in-depth understanding of the available e-waste estimation methods, could assist the reader in choosing the estimation method as per their needs and data availability. moreover, it provides avenues for researchers who may want to delve deeper into the topic.","(12 font) e-waste, estimation methods, sustainability",,"nitin koshta indian institute of management amritsar p.o. chheharta, amritsar, punjab, 143105 india nitink@iimamritsar.ac.in",
298,Determination Of Occupational Stress Level And Mental  Workload In A Manufacturing Company,"occupational stress (os) and mental workload (mwl) are some of the common things that employees are facing during their work. these two factors can happen because of responsibilities, rules of the company, lack of support, and the environment. this can lead to a reduction in productivity which is something important for every organization. so, os and mwl are two important factors that we intended to reduce both of them for a better result in any organization. many organizations want to decrease the level of occupational stress and mental workload of workers. we seek to investigate occupational stress in the manufacturing sector by establishing its causes and recommending on industrial engineering solutions to reduce it. the prime objective of this study is to investigate occupational stress and mental workload in the manufacturing sector by reviewing the various causes and effects of occupational stress on the sector. objectives of this study can be itemized as follows: • understanding of os and mwl and the measurement of os and mwl • understanding of perceived stress scale (pss) and nasa-tlx • measuring os and mwl in a manufacturing company • reducing the os and mwl for the company by using ie tools the team members started by understanding the concept of mwl and os and their measurements by doing literature reviews to know how may affect the performance. and after the investigation of mwl and os, we decided to use the nasa-tlx to measure the mwl and pss-10 to measure the os of the decision makers in a manufacturing company. also, we constructed nasa-tlx and pss-10 based surveys to identify whether decision makers are facing mwl and os or not. then these surveys were distributed to all of the decision makers, in the manufacturing company. then after collection of surveys from 32 participants, analysis of the surveys for mwl and os for 32 participants are done by using excel. we found out that company’s stress level was moderate because they had a score of 20.06 in pss- 10, and their mwl level was high because they had a 50 nasa-tlx score. in addition, we found out that the highest stressors in the company were “too much work”, then “lack of career progression”.","occupational stress, mental workload, nasa-tlx",,"abdulaziz alsawagh, ahmed altemeemi, aqeel esmaiel, hasan alostath, humoud alrowais and suat kasap college of engineering and technology, industrial engineering department american university of the middle east, eqaila, kuwait suat.kasap@aum.edu.kw",

A significant difference was found in the comparison between emotional exhaustion and entering batch year which shows a high correlation between the batch before 2019, 2019, 2020 and 2021 except for batch 2022. Significant differences also be found in the comparison between depersonalization and place of study which shows that IE students in the Philippines had higher depersonalization level than students in Indonesia. For the comparison test between academic efficacy decline and place of study also had a significant difference which shows that IE students in Indonesia had a higher academic efficacy decline than students in the Philippines. Nevertheless, study engagement level was found moderately correlated with emotional exhaustion, low correlated with depersonalization, highly correlated with academic efficacy decline and moderately correlated with overall burnout index. This finding means that IE students' efforts to engage with the academic process may help minimize the occurrence of academic burnout. A more detailed analysis also revealed that the most affected factor was poor academic performance or academic efficacy decline, which was strongly negatively correlated with student engagement. This insightful result demonstrates student engagement in helping IE students to achieve their academic achievement.","a cross-national study jeremy brian pratama department of industrial engineering universitas atma jaya yogyakarta sleman, special region of yogyakarta 55281, indonesia 211411379@students.uajy.ac.id twin yoshua r. destyanto department of industrial engineering universitas atma jaya yogyakarta sleman, special region of yogyakarta 55281, indonesia twin.destyanto@uajy.ac.id",

303,A Study On Transit-Oriented Development Strategies  Surrounding High-Speed Rail Hub,"thailand agreed with china to promote the strategic partnership through a memorandum of understanding on the cooperation on thai railways infrastructure development on the strategic framework for the development of thailand’s transportation infrastructure 2015-2022 since thailand is located a hub of land transportation connectivity among asean countries. thai-chinese high-speed rail project (phase 1: thailand’s capital bangkok to nakhon ratchasima province) is one of the megaprojects in long-term benefits under the strategic framework by the government-to-government process. this high-speed rail (hsr) project was approved by the prayut cabinet in july 2017 and was expected to operate in 2025. there are two primary reasons why thailand decided to invest in the hsr project. the first reason is to support the strategy of the development of the international railway network and the second reason is to boost the regional economic development along the pathway. however, a feasibility study of the hsr project was not feasible since the (direct) economic benefit was 8.56 % and financial benefit could not evaluate the value. both values are lower than the benchmark in economic benefit (12 %) and financial benefit (5 %) based on the office of national economic development council. this is thailand’s government is facing how to drive it to sustainable development in the long run. a feasibility study still recommended that if the thai government utilized the land development around the hsr hubs (or transit-oriented development), an economic benefit would increase from 8.56 % to 11.68 % and approach criterion. hence, tod becomes one of the alternative strategies to boost economic value. yet, thailand’s government does not have the practical know-how and experience in how to make it happen around the transit stations. meanwhile, thailand faced a limitation of land development surrounding the transport station, such as the town planning act 1975, the constitution of the kingdom of thailand 2017, and expropriation and acquisition with immovable property act 2019. this dissertation is originated from a feasibility study of the hsr project and aims to develop a comprehensive study to provide the tod strategies around the hsr hub toward sustainable development in thailand. the strategic deliberation is based on the components of tod in terms of the hsr hub and urban development. the research gap is sixfold: to investigate the barriers of the thai government for the hsr project, to explore the international policy ideas, measures, and tools to implementation; to describe the change of macroeconomic and indirect economic benefit, to examine the size of the station catchment area, to determine the primary and secondary feeder access mode choice to the hsr hub, and to examine the tension between hsr hub and urban development. the result shows that tod plays a significant player among four principal barriers (operation service, tod, new organization and panel, and fate structure) to drive the hsr project to sustainable development based on the mechanism of the barriers of the thai government for the hsr project. however, tod is a combination between transport planning and urban development by improving a relatively high level of transport connections and high- density, mixed-used-use, cycling- and pedestrian-friendly land use surrounding transit stations. other barriers are necessary for the hsr project and need to solve in the initial phase. the operation service is the political issue about signaling and telecommunication with track work in the section of bang sue and ban phachi. if the thai government determines to use shard tracks in this section, the safety and reliability should perceive for railway passengers in advance. the new organization and panel to drive the hsr project should act for railway operation and urban development since the hsr is an advanced technology and proceedings of the international conference on industrial engineering and operations management manila, philippines, march 7-9, 2023 © ieom society international 2453",,,"kittipong tissayakorn , office of the national economic and social development council, ktissayakorn@gmail.com",

305,Factors Affecting Employee Retention In The Philippine  Business Process Outsourcing Industry: Integrating Job,"according to several studies, business process outsourcing (bpo), a well-known strategy by companies which operates the non-core functions of a company, is experiencing a downturn in the industry according to the huge turnout of employee attrition which impacts the company’s performance and competitiveness. thus, the study aims to identify factors affecting employee retention in the philippine bpo industry by integrating job embeddedness theory utilizing minitab 19 statistical software to perform multiple regression analysis. a self-administered questionnaire was distributed through convenience sampling, gathering 710 respondents at least 18 years old and currently/previously employed in a philippine bpo company. results show that rewards and recognition, employee engagement, fit, job satisfaction are significant variables affecting employee retention among employees in the philippine bpo industry. the researchers have provided a strong model and important findings to easily understand the significant factors which will enable bpo companies in the philippines to strategically position themselves by improving company policies to avoid unnecessary costs about monetary and performance-related setbacks.","employee retention, employee attrition","and Recommendation The research is conducted to identify and also understand the statistically significant factors affecting employee retention among Filipino BPO employees. The variables presented in this study were examined carefully and were grounded according to the application of the Job Embeddedness Theory. Alongside, using the Multiple Regression Analysis the said variables were evaluated. The results indicate that the management should focus on increasing Rewards and Recognition (RR), Fit (F), Employee Engagement (EE), and Job Satisfaction (JS) as these are statistically significant factors affecting employee retention in the Philippine BPO industry with a model fit of 80.63%. Moreover, the researchers recommend prioritizing employees’ rewards and recognition (RR) in terms of re-evaluating employee compensation and aligning them to their key performance indicator which also relates to employee job fitness (F), which impacts the whole organization itself. In addition, the researchers recommend improving employee engagement (EE) through town hall meetings to assess the current work relationship among employees and the overall work environment. Lastly, increasing Job Satisfaction (JS) in ways such as ensuring a cohesive work environment, aligning management structure and providing more growth opportunities like training and personal development programs shall make employees feel more satisfied towards their jobs. Hence, it will reduce incurred training costs and turnover rates for the company while allowing it to achieve increased profitability as an organization. Furthermore, future studies may also apply other hypotheses that would be relevant in reducing employee attrition among BPO employees.","embeddedness theory yoshiki b. kurata, kervin victor s. belisario, mariah mervette d. mescala, and rafael lorenzo l. valenzuela department of industrial engineering university of santo tomas españa blvd, 1015, manila, philippines ybkurata@ust.edu.ph, kervinvictor.belisario.eng@ust.edu.ph, mariahmervette.mescala.eng@ust.edu.ph, rafaellorenzo.valenzuela.eng@ust.edu.ph",
306,Sustainable Biodiversity Preservation In The Pacific  Noel Martin,"biodiversity conservation is one of the key magnesium to preserve and protect the variety of natural environment and animals for the next trend of future generations to come. the biodiversity including plants, animals and sea or water creatures are equally important to be conserved and sustained as they play a key role in the preservation of ecosystem which ultimately maintains and balances the life of the planet including human being. the pacific island countries are blessed with varieties of unique breeds of plants and animals including birds and reptiles which are not found anywhere else around the world. due to recent industrialization and increase in technology with the want of money or earning profits from huge companies, they have turned the forests, seas and environment into desert or polluted and completely change the phase of the natural beauties. this includes mining of both underwater and land which vastly destroyed the plants and animals or fishing without any sustainability mechanism to mitigate and minimize complete deterioration. in the recent past, the pacific islands country’s hard woods have profoundly attracted logging companies and mining industries have played a key role in depleting natural resources and thus, biodiversity are vulnerable to destruction and depleting in the process. the government need to sustain the natural beauties including plants and animals for the benefit of the future and to maintain balance in ecosystem. this is so much concern and because more plants are destroyed, it leads to rise in sea level, increase in greenhouse gas and eventually small islands are sinking in the pacific. this is happening at the alarming rate and thus requires immediate actions to preserve and protect the biodiversity in the pacific and around the world.","biodiversity, greenhouse gas, sustainable, logging","One of the best mechanism and strategy to use and to sustain biodiversity around the pacific island countries is by enacting tough laws within their own countries. this will effectively regulate, sustain and protect the country’s most diverse and unique species without further extension as its very important for the benefit of humankind. The western countries such as Australia and US needs to step in to address the pacific countries on the importance of the biodiversity preservation and educate people of the environmental sustainability and conservation. This needed to be conducted in conjunction with world environmental protection acts and to fund adequate money for the betterment of all pacific island nations. A lot of mining activities popping everywhere in the pacific including undersea mining have drastically affected the biodiversity conservation. The major companies have reluctantly deployed enough machineries and hazardous chemical which are more harmful to the environment and thus consequences are catastrophic. The oil and gas companies have also setup complicated facilities which when spillage or mismanaged are somewhat very terrible to the environment therein. Places like Papua New Guinea have experienced such hazardous chemicals as it entertained various companies which can mine minerals as well as oil and gas. This also includes fishing and logging where major destructions are expected (Jupiter et al., 2014). Logging being the main disadvantages as it profoundly exploits significant amount of forest thereby leaving nothing but the naked soils with missing and or destroyed biodiversity. As trees continued to be cleared in mass quantities where tonnes of logs are shipped overseas without stringent sustainable methodology to preserve, we gained nothing useful accept naked soil and destroyed environment. Additionally, Papua New Guinea prime minister Hon. James Marape has condemned carbon emissions in the first world countries which gives rise to the sea level. The size of biodiversity in the pacific islands countries are really affected due to continuous logging and mining including carbon emissions. This is one of the greatest concerns ever and address by PNG prime minister in United Nations General Assembly recently. The lungs of the world are fed by the worlds rainforest and biodiversity including 13% contribution from PNG and the south pacific biodiversity. As such, the strongest possible contamination and pollution in the world which gives rise to sea-level in the pacific is failure to sustain, preserve and protect the environment’s biodiversity and effectively apply environmental laws and educate the people concern from the top to the bottom for the benefit of all doubts and to provide better environment for our planet. World leaders have no concern and are ready to take necessary actions to ensure the worlds carbon emission and biodiversity depletion to be minimised and ensure to provide effective and stringent mechanisms to sustain and conserve biodiversity in the south pacific and around the world. United States of America, Chain and other first world nations are now concern to reduce the amount of carbon emissions which is one of the world’s enemies that continue to impact the small islands nations by increasing sea-level thereby increase in global warming. The people are now ever convinced that if the world leaders have not taken actions and only talking, it would bring nothing but destructions in our very eyes and then it’s too late to act when islands are already sinking.

307,Impact Of Covid-19 In The Pacific And Sustainable Methods Of  Mitigation,"the pacific island countries are underdeveloped countries on earth with different traditional backgrounds and thus yet to adapt to western cultures. for the past few months, the pacific island countries have been hard hit by the second wave of covid-19 where people who were considered above 45 years have been vulnerable and susceptible to death. this was happening on our very eyes and confounded and scary because such as never experienced before. from first wave of coronavirus, it has been treated and considered spineless ineffective disease which the people of the pacific islands countries were naturally immune including papua new guinea until the second wave hit the hardest. the countries in the pacific islands are completely and totally vulnerable to death due to lowest economy, poor health systems, and unreliable public service and most importantly underdeveloped. economies were crippling at the steady rate when government considered lockdown and people have suffered greatly thus implications are of very severe. the pacific countries are considered most crippling nations by covid-19 because the size and magnitude of our economy, health facilities and the people’s lifestyles have profoundly affected and contributed towards the escalating trend of covid-19 pandemic. the issues faced now is to mitigate spread and combat sustainably from the pandemic.","coronavirus, economy, health, sustainability","Due to covid-19 outbreak, Pacific islands countries like PNG, Fiji, Vanuatu and rest of the other pacific countries will be vulnerable to both health and economic threats due to lake of sustainable economic recovery plan. Developing countries in likes of economic and technology including infrastructure with minimal strength in currency will surely fall when more lockdown of these countries are imminent. It is more advisable and encouraging to allow the country to operate on stringent government regulations and sustainable policies that will also mitigate and effectively bail out dying economy. This will surely assist to ensure our economy is maintained at a certain limit without deterioration. Health and hygiene of the people are in the pacific countries are norm to traditional ways of survival though moved into twenty-first century in this changing globe. People are dying due to lake of knowledge and ignorance and failure to comply with certain rules like taking vaccines and other health protocols. The importance of having health protocols are merely taken as ordinary rules which is the main reasons why people are dying in this second wave of the covid-19. Furthermore, people are complacent within their own ways and have faith in their sustainable immune systems which is also one of the reasons people started contract this disease. If people continue to live carelessly and do not pay attention to the health protocols including get vaccinated, pacific island will be another evil place to live when all will be gradually queued up for grave. This is imminent and already happening because it’s bad for the country and thus effective sustainable policy to mitigate virus spread is paramount.

308,Impressed Current Cathodic Protection And  Environmental Impacts,"the impressed current cathodic protection is one of the key methods of protecting steel structures including, jetties, gas pipelines, oil tanks, harbors wharfs, ships and bridges. impressed current method is applied throughout the world as the advanced and modified method of protecting structures from rusting or evade possible corrosion. the method is also considered to be fit in an environment to ensure its free from releasing hazardous substances that may cause destructive to surrounding wildlife’s and its natural beauties. in papua new guinea, the impressed current method of protecting structures from corrosion are practiced by both state and companies established to arrest and mitigate corrosion. the polarization and depolarization of currents or electrons vigorously mitigate the flow of electrons from anodes to cathodes. the electrons then tend to migrate (lose electrons) from the more active metals (anode) to less active (structure, cathode electrode). in the process, active metals decays and corrode thereby protecting the less active metals (steel pipelines and tanks). in the process, production of pollutants is imminent from anodes used and thus necessary steps are undertaken to ensure all is minimized and mitigated. current from the transformer rectifier flows on a consistence manner which supplies negatively charged electrons from the cathode (structure) and proceeds it through connection cables towards anodes (polarization). at anode, the oxidation reaction takes place thereby gaining oxygen ions and loses hydrogen ions. reduction reaction occurs at the cathode where the hydrogen ions are gained and releases oxygen ions and thus, the process continues until the design life of the anode elapse and the active element sacrificed and corrodes and worn-out for possible replacements.","anodes, cathodes, polarization",,"aezeden mohamed associate professor, papua new guinea university of technology, lae, morobe province, papua new guinea aezeden.mohamed@pnguot.ac.pg noel martin former masters student at department of civil engineering, papua new guinea university of technology, lae morobe province papua new guinea","References

309,Improve Sacrificial Anodes To Impressed Current In Puma  Energy Png Limited Throughout The Country,"the cathodic protection of steel structures for puma energy in papua new guinea have been deteriorating since construction due to inadequate potential supply from the anodes. the magnitude of protection using sacrificial anodes have been considered inadequate and thus amount to failing cp systems throughout all parts of the country. this has been revealed via various other cp companies and commissioned by puma energy png limited to carry possible inspection and maintenance on established structures. because the sacrificial anodes entirely depend its potential difference between the cathodes and anodes, it is quite tedious and complex to adequately supply protective current throughout all intended structural path for effective protection. the sacrificial anodes cathodic protection system established throughout all puma energy terminals in the country have reported to have been failed. massive and complex structures such as steel tanks of both underground and surface or pipelines have inadequately protected by the sacrificial anodes. as such, the company is looking for recommendations to improve sacrificial anodes to impressed current cathodic protection system. port moresby’s idubada cp terminal and weak, east sepik provinces have faced the same problems and is widely faced throughout the country. puma energy’s facilities are deteriorating and failing cp protection and thus have been greatly recommended by various cp contactors to looking into possible replacement with impressed current method as it rendered effective protection than sacrificial anodes.","electrolyte, impressed current, protected, sacrificial anodes","As noted from data and graphs, it can be concluded that the amount of CP protection rendered to the facilities were considered to be insufficient and weak. This is due to stray current but most probably because of the weak nature of the potential supplied by the anodes which profoundly resist the flow of impressive current. As such, it is highly recommended that Puma Energy PNG limited needs to install impressed current cathodic protection system because it effectively protects the structures from corrosion. The amount of protective current rendered by impressed current is more sufficient and adequate to protective even a larger structures compared to sacrificial anodes. The main advantage of impressed current method is the external power supply source that reinforces its natural potentials from the installed anodes. Thus Port Moresby and Wewak needs to improve its sacrificial anodes systems to impressed current methods including other centers around the country.

310,Practicing Sustainable Procurement In Papua New Guinea  Noel Martin,"the procurement process is an efficient way of contract awarding system to the qualified contractors based on the record of similar years of experience. contract documents are composed of executable items by the contractor from employer and is agreed by both parties for possible implementation per the agreement. one of the most efficient methods in drafting contract document is the efforts used to ensure contractor is well guided by the environmental management plans (emp) which forms part of the contract. this is to ensure the surrounding communities are protected and simultaneously sustained by the tangible projects like building, roads and bridges, etc. through recent covid-19 pandemic that bombarded the world in less than a week or two, kept millions indoors and thousands in hospitals and graves, this will be one of the major issues that may be considered for possible inclusion to avoid undue hiccups in the future. the results of these items to be included and others on next set of conform contract amendments to the bill or considered for possible execution. the data or results when executed will yield positive outcome on the technical side on the benefit of procurement process. this will also watch and guide contractors on the importance of the pandemic experienced so far and take as a precautionary measure to protect the personals on site and thus avoid spread of the virus and in emergency. sustainability of the environment and other surrounding properties within the vicinity of project site is paramount important. thus, the emp comes to play a vital role in ensuring all things found through the zone of influence must be protected and sustained. thus, per the contract agreement, all are protected and sustained but at the expense of the employer. for the covid-19 pandemic to be incorporated into the contract agreement, it will certainly improve the document to more proper and standard in considering all emergency measures into consideration plus the safety of the construction works on site who are vulnerable by airborne disease may use masks or hand sanitizers not only for covid-19 but for safe health practices. thus, this will be used in avoiding and addressing, social responsibility, environmental sustainability, economic improvement and effective healthcare system including immediate issue which may be imminent ahead in the future.",economic,"By analyzing the effect of coronavirus outbreak and consequences, lessons learnt, and other results, it is necessary and fitting for the government to invoke fastest procurement and sustainable procurement to be established and enacted into law. This will relieve pressing issues in relations to importing drugs rather than taking too much time waiting. Waiting would mean more people death and the disease is already uncontainable. Thus it is the prerogative of the government and should be a prerequisite for the all countries after learning what happened and thus expedite the process of purchasing goods and services that are considered worthwhile and useful for the benefit of the general 2529","former masters student at department of civil engineering, papua new guinea university of technology, lae morobe province papua new guinea noethswaim@gmail.com aezeden mohamed associate professor, papua new guinea university of technology, lae, morobe province, papua new guinea aezeden.mohamed@pnguot.ac.pg umamaheswararao mogili industrial design department, national institute of technology, rourkela umajrfnit@gmail.com",
311,Evaluation Of Microbus-Based Public Transport Services  Quality During The Covid-19 Pandemic In Sorong City,"this study aims to evaluate the performance quality of microbus-based public transportation facilities in sorong city. route a is the longest route with various land uses for trade, hotels, ports, stadiums, housing, schools, and offices. the covid-19 pandemic and the rise of online taxi bikes have reduced the potential for this public transportation line. the research method is observation and analysis of service performance based on the decree of the director general no. 687/aj.206/drjd/2002. the evaluation results show that service time performance is in the medium category because there is no information on operating hours from 06.00-17.00 eit, travel time is less than 12 km/hour, speed below 5 km/hour, and load factor less than 70-110%. however, the frequency of the number of vehicles operating, the headway, and the waiting time are optimal.","load factor, frequency","The discussion above concludes that several things cause poor route performance. The first is the unavailability of information on service times at the terminal or the stopping point. Second, travel time and speed because the lowest rate is below 5 km/hour. The longest travel time is less than 12 km/hour in segment 1, which has office land use from the Remu-Simpang Polresta Terminal on holidays. Third, the largest dynamic load factor value of 45% is less than 70-110% in weekday morning rush hour. It indicates that the route is less than optimal in serving the movement of passengers, which can be due to the pandemic's movement restrictions and the increasing number of online taxi bikes. However, the frequency of vehicles, the time between, and the waiting time are optimal with good service. 2536","kadek yadi maryadi, edi kuncoro and alfred sanny talaksoru civil engineering study program,faculty of engineering narotama university,surabaya, indonesia marlonmamen@gmail.com sri wiwoho mudjanarko* senior lecturer, civil engineering study program faculty of engineering, narotama university surabaya, indonesia sri.wiwoho@narotama.ac.id rizal bahaswan civil engineering study program faculty of engineering, narotama university surabaya, indonesia rizal.bahaswan@narotama.ac.id","References

313,Beef Freshness Detection Device Based On Gas And Color  Sensors Using,"the freshness of beef becomes the most important factor affecting the quality of the meat. the need for beef continues to increase, indicating that awareness of the importance of eating meat is getting higher and higher. with the high price of beef in the market, it makes some people who cheat mix the quality of beef with cut meat that has been stored for a long time. the purchase of beef is usually carried out to identify the freshness of the meat with the naked eye and sense of smell as well as direct contact by suppressing the texture of the meat. however, this method has the disadvantage that consumers are not observant and have difficulty distinguishing the quality of beef freshness. therefore, in this study, we tried to examine the level of freshness of beef by using the tgs 2602, mq - 135 gas sensors as detectors of voc and ammonia compounds produced by meat and the tcs3200 color sensor by using rgb values as identification of the beef. this study also analyzed the level of beef freshness with indicators obtained from the three sensors using the k- nearest neighbor method. in this study, there were 3 conditions of the level of freshness of the meat tested, namely fresh meat, slightly fresh meat, and non-fresh meat with an accuracy rate of 93%.","sensor tgs 2602, senor mq 135, sensor tcs 3200, atmega328","Based on testing on the color sensor block, the color sensor can respond to differences in the level of redness that is the parameter of meat freshness. In the gas sensor test, different voltage patterns were obtained for the two sensors against 3 meat samples with different levels of freshness. Through the use of the K- Nearest method, the system built can determine the level of freshness of beef well. The more training data values and the smaller the K value, the better the accuracy of the system. The first conclusion of the system as a whole is the use of a color sensor and two gas sensors can be implemented to properly classify the level of freshness of beef. In addition, the use of human sense of smell and vision in determining the level of freshness of beef can be replaced by electronic devices in the form of gas sensors and color sensors. And the last one is that through the use of the K- Nearest Neighbor method, the system built can determine the level of freshness of beef with a success rate of up to 90%.","the k- nearest neighbor method asep denih and irma anggraeni faculty of mathematics and natural sciences pakuan university bogor, indonesia asep.denih@unpak.ac.id",
