0,Supply Chain Differentiation: A Quantitative Fuzzy  Application To Segment Demand Driven Supply Chains,"companies are confirming that in a vuca (volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous) world, it is possible to gather improvements from becoming demand driven. to achieve this, it is important for organizations to be aware of the supply chains present on its operations to apply different segmentation approaches in managing them. we analyzed several segmentation models in order to adapt one of them to identify a demand driven supply chain (ddsc) in a company object of study. the objective was to quantify the percentage of produced volume which has ddsc characteristics, based on the buying behavior of two previously identified customers group. the proposed model enabled the organization to identify that 47,94% of group a volume and 85,07% of group b volume were adherent to a ddsc. by using gathered data from a real application, the model strongly supports the use of a quantitative fuzzy methodology to segment supply chains, since the results were coherent to the reality pointed by the experts from the studied industry. the adapted model contributed to the alignment of the supply chain of the studied industry, providing a more accurate evaluation methodology than other proposed models in literature, facilitating the indication of strategic paths to realignment.",,"This work main proposal was to adapt a supply chain segmentation model to assess the identification of DDSCs in industries. It is important to develop new approaches to enable companies to better positioning themselves and to guide them into finding new methods and tools to thrive in this more turbulent and dynamic markets. This study illustrates the adaptation and application of a fuzzy methodology to identify a DDSC in a fertilizer mixing industry. Aligned with the main objective, the proposed model was able to evaluate the current patterns in the clients and company behavior from a quantitative set of data. According to the data obtained from the model application, 47,94% of the demand from Group A and 85,07% of the demand from Group B were adherent to a DDSC. There are many segmentation models, but none of them seeks to identify the Demand Driven environment. This work adapted a model that, according to Ferreira (2017), united two strong and different schools in supply chain segmentation (the lean-agile and the dynamic alignment schools), in order to accomplish the objective of identify the DDSC. The results confirmed the initial affirmation of two distinct customer segments, deepening the understanding that, besides clients, the supply chains were significantly different. Another objective of the work was to propose strategies for the company to align their operations with the supply chain. As previously shown, the model proposed by Ptak and Smith (2018) called DDAE might be a solution for the company to adapt their strategy to the DDSC identified in the study. Despite the results, we recognize that our study is not a definitive model for quantitatively segmenting supply chains. It is needed further research and exploration in order to accomplish important and necessary advancements. As proposed future research, we suggest (1) a better characterization of the DDSC; (2) tests with another segmentation models in order to seek a faster result and (3) the creation of methods to remove the human judgment in the creation of the parameters for the membership functions, such as Neurofuzzy techniques, making the segmentation happen in real time.","lucas alves s. santos¹ and kleber francisco espôsto² department of production engineering são carlos school of engineering university of são paulo são carlos, brazil ¹lucassantos@usp.br ²kleberesposto@usp.br",

3,Education In The Anthropocene: Disinformation And Power  Relations On Environmental Education,"the change in the use of natural resources on our planet is a most urgent topic to be addressed in the environmental agendas of all governments and discussed by civil society and the academic community. as consequence of this period known as anthropocene, global warming is one of the most critical issues on the environmental agenda in the 21st century as it affects biogeochemical cycles and planetary biodiversity. in terms of sustainability, higher education can introduce new trends in the domains of education, research, and extension. however, understanding the environmental agenda requires a more careful analysis of information, stakeholder dynamics, public management and conflict of interest. how to counter desinformation about environmental education in heis (higher education institutions)? this qualitative research based on the federal network of professional scientific and technological teaching (rfepct) seeks, through the proposal of a digital platform, to present a means of greening education.","hei, desinformation, not sustainable","As consequence of this recently called Anthropocene period, climate change is one of the most significant axes of the environmental agenda in the 21st century, as it affects biogeochemical cycles and planetary biodiversity. However, it should not be forgotten that we are embedded in a consumer society that promotes, encourages or reinforces the choice of a consumerist lifestyle and existential strategy, and rejects all alternative cultural options. Questioning the growth society implies questioning capitalism, the current planetary crisis elicits different responses in individuals, groups and governments, ranging from denial, misunderstanding and indifference to a yearning for engagement and activism. At first glance, it seems impossible to build 'sustainable development' without an education for greening. Regarding the educational, scientific and academic field, this context requires commitment to the search for technical and political-economic solutions that meet the material and symbolic needs that structure contemporary society, without ignoring the conflicts of interest in this and its contradictions. The relationship between environment and citizenship education takes on an increasingly challenging role, demanding the emergence of new knowledge to grasp social processes that are becoming more complex every day. At this point, there needs to be an educational process capable of positioning itself politically and conducting a critical analysis of the various social and environmental projects that dispute social and political-pedagogical goals.

5,Response Profiles In The Rose Survey,"science, technology, engineering and mathematics (stem) are not particularly popular disciplines among university applicants. in addition, there is high rate of dropouts in the first years of these programs. since motivation is a very important factor in the selection of a university program as well as in students´ success or failure, we have included the national university of hurlingham to the relevance of science education (rose) project. in order to know more about students´ attitudes, a survey was carried out among 359 high school students in argentina. a four- point likert scale was used to analyze answers on the basis of the principal component analysis (pcm). four profile related components were obtained: • c1. topics in the sections: “what i would like to learn”. 109 context-related topics in natural sciences (environmental protection, common affairs, natural phenomena, health, mysteries, cts, nos, etc.). of these, this profile includes aspects related to health and reproduction, in particular sexual health, sex, growth and maturation and diseases. • c2. aspects the sections: “what i would like to learn” related with technology (functions of technological objects, substances such as petroleum, explosives). items from the section “my future work” appear less often (such as work with machines, tools or technology, creation or repair of technological objects). • c3. topics related with “what i would like to learn” mostly appear in two subject groups: mysteries, outer space objects and extraterrestrial life on the one hand; and on the other recent inventions and discoveries. protection of endangered species is also mentioned. • c4. in the section “my experiences outside school”, the following are mentioned: use of levers, wheelbarrows and binoculars, garbage separation and tire repair. proceedings of the international conference on industrial engineering and operations management sao paulo, brazil, april 5 - 8, 2021 © ieom society international 245",,,"diego petrucci universidad nacional de hurlingham. instituto de educación. av. vergara 2222, b1688gez villa tesei, buenos aires, argentina. departamento de ciencias básicas, facultad de ingeniería, universidad nacional de la plata, 1 y 47, cp 1900, la plata, buenos aires, argentina. diego.petrucci@unahur.edu.ar, diegope@gmail.com monica giuliano universidad nacional de hurlingham. instituto de tecnología e ingeniería. av. vergara 2222, (b1688gez), villa tesei, buenos aires, argentina. departamento de ingeniería e investigaciones tecnológicas, universidad nacional de la matanza, buenos aires, argentina. monica.giuliano@unahur.edu.ar, mgiuliano@unlam.edu.ar juan pedrosa universidad nacional de hurlingham. instituto de tecnología e ingeniería. av. vergara 2222, (b1688gez), villa tesei, buenos aires, argentina. juan.pedrosa@unahur.edu.ar",
6,Using E-Status For Assist Learning In A Probability And  Statistics Subject,"in the subject probability and statistics for engineering careers at national university of la matanza, argentina, a high number of dropouts and disapprovals are observed. taking this into account, the professors of this subject started some years ago to use an automatic self-correcting web platform called e-status. this platform has the free software r as a calculation engine and allows parameterizing problems so that students can solve it several times, with variations. the students have an active repository of problems to practice the contents proposed by their teachers, obtaining immediate correction of their results. although the results obtained in previous publications of this research group show a clear incidence of the practice in e-status on the approval of the subject, it was observed the need to accompany the numerical exercises with others of conceptual or theoretical type to favor reflection and metacognition of the contents. students require more guidance for learning in e- learning spaces that favor the questioning of their conceptual assumptions and their way of appropriating the contents. to take these aspects into account, we worked on the contents of the platform and offered students a course in metacognitive strategies. the monitoring carried out from 2016 to 2018 shows a statistically significant academic improvement in favor of those who use the platform. additionally, the increase in the use of the platform is an indicator of the value given by students and teachers to it, with a positive effect on the approval of the subject and consequently on the decrease in dropouts.","e-learning, web-based tools",,"silvia noemí perez department of engineering and technological research national university of la matanza buenos aires, argentina sperez@unlam.edu.ar monica giuliano department of engineering and technological research national university of la matanza, buenos aires, argentina universidad nacional de hurlingham. instituto de tecnología e ingeniería. av. vergara 2222, (b1688gez), villa tesei, buenos aires, argentina. mgiuliano@unlam.edu.ar, monica.giuliano@unahur.edu.ar",
7,Analyzing Factors Responsible For Energy Use In The  Construction Industry,"this study emphasized on the famous factors (activity, structure and intensity) responsible for energy consumed in the south african construction and building industry between 1994 and 2016. a famous technique in the understanding of such factors was employed – logarithmic mean divisia index (lmdi). structure effect was inconsequential on its impact on the change in energy consumption. intensity on the other hand played its role to affecting the energy consumption positively but could not overturn the increase experienced during the period of study. activity effect was the major contributor to the 88.7% increase in the energy consumed. improvement on energy efficiency within this industry requires not just investment on new technologies but improvement on existing technologies will improve the various activities/operations needed within the industry.","lmdi, energy consumption","In this study, factors responsible for the increase in South Africa’s energy consumption at the building construction and civil engineering and the construction industrial sectors was analysed between 1994 and 2016. These factors include activity, structure and intensity. Analysis was carried out using the additive LMDI. It can be concluded that (1) activity was the most responsible factor leading to 88.7% increase of energy from 1994 to 2016. Most of the activities involved in the industry are the extraction, processing and manufacture, transportation and assembly. Production of a concrete would require approximately 2.775 MJ of energy. The amount of energy is a lot especially with the number of concretes to be manufactured by these industries in the promotion of economic growth. (2) Intensity had a positive effect on the energy consumption through its reduction proving efficient use of energy though not sufficient enough to reduce the total consumption of energy. (3) Structure effect was unrecognizable in its impact made towards the increase of energy consumption during the period of study. To improve on the energy efficiency as it concerns the various activities, not just investment on new technologies are important but an improvement of existing technologies would go a long way. This will lead to an improvement in the operational efficiency and optimization of the allocation of resources (in this case – energy) as it is required for the industry processes.

8,Process Capability In Lgpd Context: Characterization And  Potential Future Directions,"given the importance of data and information, it is also important to treat and develop data as a core business asset. this means that data needs to be actively managed at all stages of the data lifecycle (i.e collected, stored, analyzed, shared, and archived) through defined data practices, standards, and policies. law 13.709 / 2018 impacts on private and public companies nationwide, considering any size and market segment, while taking into account the need to meet the requirements efficiently and sustainably. the aim of this paper is to characterize the main areas of contribution to the evaluation of the process capability for digital transformation in relation to cybersecurity in the context of the general data protection law and to present some topics in which field research could be further developed. to this end, a citation / citation analysis of the literature related to process capability and process improvement models published in the main journals from 2000 to 2019 is made. the main authors are identified and a field is analyzed, with the objective of identifying the areas of contribution. the results show that contributions can be characterized in areas such as business processes, iso, maturity models, risk management, decision support.","lgpd, data protection, machines",,"gianfranco muncinelli, edson pinheiro de lima, fernando deschamps, sergio e. gouvea da costa, juliana lara souza, alexandre dos santos pereira, josé marcelo a. p. cestari industrial and systems engineering graduate program pontifical catholic university of parana curitiba, pr, brazil gmunci@hotmail.com; e.pinheiro@pucpr.br; fernando.deschamps@pucpr.br; s.gouvea@pucpr.br; julianalara9828@gmail.com; ale952@gmail.com; cestari@ufpr.br",
9,Applying Data Mining Techniques And Analytic Hierarchy  Process To The Food Industry: Estimating Customer Lifetime,"customer segmentation is increasingly needed in a context where customer interests are vital for companies to survive. this study proposes the use of the weighted rfm (recency, frequency, monetary) supported by data mining techniques and the analytic hierarchy process (ahp), to classify the customers according to their lifetime value (clv). the customer segments obtained can be used to boost marketing strategies, as these segments enable to differentiate the customers. each segment of customers is described by a set of rules based on the customers’ purchasing patterns. the methodology developed is validated by using a real case study, i.e. a food industry company, whose core business is the production of biscuits.","ahp, clustering","and Future Work This paper aims at demonstrating how a customer-centric analysis can be created through the application of data mining techniques and AHP. Two segmentation models were presented, being the first one selected, considering the feasibility of implementation. Subsequently, the respective CLV for each segment of customers was estimated. The objective of the customers segmentation is not only to identify segments, but to discover how they can articulate and integrate into the 4P strategy (Price, Place, Product and Promotion). As a next step, it is necessary to explore the development of the strategy to be launched, resulting from the segmentation process. With the information resulting from this study, the company could define a different strategy depending on the type of clusters. For the segment referring to the lowest value, marketing campaigns and discounts could be launched to stimulate buying, make current products known (for example, by providing samples), promote experimentation, dispose of products or blur seasonality of consumption. For clusters that currently have a higher value, premium treatment and a closer relationship with the customers, is recommended to maintain customer value. Given the company's focus on innovation and the consequent launch of new products, it could be interesting to involve the most valuable customers in the ideation and/or to guarantee exclusive sales, in order to reinforce their special nature. Throughout the development of this project, most of the time was spent on processing the information provided by the company, which corroborates with several data mining studies that emphasize that the preparation stage is one of the most relevant and often time-consuming aspects of these type of projects (Khajvand, Zolfaghar et al. 2011, Bunnak, Thammaboosadee et al. 2015). This reinforces the importance of keeping information organized and up to date, providing a central point of consultation and record of information.

In times of Industry 4.0, the advantages of additive manufacturing (AM), particularly its design flexibility and low material wastage, become these processes important alternatives the integration of metal AM into current and future production systems. Considering the same metallic material in manufacturing, SLM and EBM show better mechanical behavior than SLS because they have layer fully melting and solidification process, while SLS has not the ability to do so. Ferrous and nonferrous metals continue to be crucial in engineering because these materials allow technological viability in terms of optimization of manufacturing processes, materials and desired properties.

27,A Flexible Integer Linear Programming Formulation For A  Class Of Bus Driver Rostering Problems,"in this work is present a novel integer linear programming formulation to solve an operation planning problem in public transport systems. the proposed model is flexible, and it works by adding or removing specific constraints for the operation, depending on the laws of the corresponding country and the policies of a particular company. the formulation proposed in this work models a generic version of the bus driver rostering problem, which has a considerable amount of issues to be considered, mostly due to the complexity of the personnel management and their assignment of the daily duty. the main issues taken into account in the model are the specific work conditions, labor regulations for each country, companies’ internal policies and available staff. these are included as sets of hard constraints of the problem. in the literature, it was observed that there is a lack of general mathematical models representing this class of problems. consequently, most of the published research related to this problem concern the development of heuristic solutions. moreover, two-phase hybrid approaches combining heuristic and exact methodologies, for the first and second stage, respectively, are not able to ensure optimal solutions. in this study, the model is tested on three different scenarios: (i) benchmark instances, (ii) newly proposed benchmark instances simulating the operation of a transport company varying the types of shifts and available staff, and (iii) real case of a public transport company of a bus rapid transit (brt) system in colombia. computational experiments show that a mixed integer programming (mip) solver is capable of obtaining optimal solutions for each of the aforementioned scenarios in reasonable computing times. proceedings of the international conference on industrial engineering and operations management sao paulo, brazil, april 5 - 8, 2021 © ieom society international 372",,,"kenny cárdenas-parra industrial engineering department universidad tecnológica de pereira pereira, colombia kennycardenas@utp.edu.co rubén iván bolaños and césar augusto marín-moreno research, development & innovation department integra s.a. pereira, colombia rbolanos@integra.com.co, cmarin@integra.com.co luis miguel escobar-falcón program of systems engineering universidad libre pereira, colombia luism.escobarf@unilibre.edu.co mauricio granada-echeverri electrical engineering department universidad tecnológica de pereira pereira, colombia magra@utp.edu.co",
28,"Operations Strategy, Environmental Management And  Sustainability – There Is A New Competitive","the aim this qualitative research was to verify if the environment factor could be a new competitive priority in the operations strategy (os), together with cost, delivery, flexibility and quality. the relationship between environmental management (em) and os in market-leading and iso-14001 certified industrial companies was analyzed: natura cosmetics, tilibra stationery products and companies x and y. the data were obtained from bibliographic research, semi-structured interviews, systematic observations and documentary consultation. the approach was deep enough to get yours results. the need to deal strategically with the environmental issue is not incorporated in os theory. the exemplary companies studied indicate a path to success with any generic competitive strategy (cs). the environmental factor has a strategic potential for competitive differentiation, it allows reducing costs (water, energy, etc.) and attending the stakeholders. differentiation with a focus on the environmental factor allows greater profit margin, a support for unfeasible environmental measures from the perspective of low cost. the environmental factor can compose the os as a qualifying factor for attend so the legislation, the market, and the customers. thus, the environmental factor can/must be considered a new competitive priority for operations; however, it must be combined with sustainability and the innovation.","operations strategy, sustainability, natura","of this research is its qualitative character: it is not a matter of extrapolating the results from a probabilistic sample, but of verifying but of verifying advanced strategies and trends that companies can follow in order to obtain competitive advantage. In this way, they can be motivated to work the environmental factor at a strategic level, minimally by its qualifying character with the clients. The environmental factor and your management deserve strategic emphasis, to reduce harmful consequences of the environmental issue, and because of their potential to contribute to the maintenance, survival and growth of the company. As for competitive differentiation, when many companies are working at the strategic level, this factor may no longer be a differentiating. However, it will have continuity as a qualifying factor.

30,Techno-Economic Assessment For The Production Of 400 Tpd Of  Sulphuric Acid Using Waste Sulphur Gases From Coal,"this study focused on the techno-economic assessment of sulphur gas removal from coal combustion, pyrolysis and gasification in the flue gas stream in order to reduce harmful emissions from the coal industry which causes adverse effects to the environment. a potential of valorisation of the so2 to valuable, sulphuric acid (h2so4) is therefore analysed. the design of a 400 tpd h2so4 production process utilizing sulphur from coal combustion and pyrolysis flue gases is proposed. experiments conducted indicated a 2.12%.wt by mass of coal is the sulphur content in the flue gases. the modified claus process, amine process and the contact process were selected as the best processes for optimum h2so4 production. based on the mass balances, the calculated gas flow rate from the power station boilers which utilize an average of 6000 tpd of coal was 146.33 t/hr. economic analysis showed that the production cost of a tonne of h2so4 is usd 32.47 and the profit margin was usd 57.53, the return on investment (roi) was 44%, with a payback period of 2.28 years and the breakeven point was 60 tpd indicating the viability of utilizing the recovered sulphur to produce h2so4 both technically and economically.","coal, flue gases, h2so4, hydrogen",From the analysis carried out it can be concluded that it is possible to produce 400 tpd of H2SO4 from sulphur recovered from coal combustion gas and coke oven gas. The operational considerations such as the process design and economic assessment were taken into account. The production cost of the H2SO4 is USD 32.58/tonne with a payback period of 2.28 years. The selling price is USD 90/tonne which is the current price of H2SO4.Thefore the H2SO4 production from coal combustion and coal pyrolysis process is technically and economically viable.

playing a major role (Karl, 1965). Watch out for traps that can derail a good decision making process. Bias in 
the information gathered, such as using only one person's point of view and selecting only favourable results.
Poor decisions can be made due to using only one interpretation of the information, creating similarities or 
differences where none exist - perceived rather than real, not communicating, sweeping failures under the rug 
instead of letting the past be used to empower the present and future, relying on the memories of people and
treating external departments like foreign powers as well as allowing a few individuals who have a need to be 
indispensable to hoard information that should be generally available to everyone. 
7. The Rationale Decision Making Process in Mining Organisations 
Decision making in mining organizations can be accomplished with the following steps when there is time and 
the decision requires analysis before it is made (Collier et al., 2006). What is the objective in making the
decision? What results are desired from making this decision? What is trying to be achieved? Objectives should 
be operational, practical and attainable. Statements of objectives should include constraints which can refer to 
how the objective will be attained, how resources are used and how conflicts with organizational goals are
avoided. Objectives should be ranked according to their importance, such as critical, desirable or good to have."
32,Application Of The Situational Leadership Model To  Achieve Effective Performance In Mining Organizations,"the situational leadership theory is becoming increasingly popular in modern organizational leadership especially in the mining sector. the most important task in situational leadership is being able to motivate the subordinates. a leader’s adaptableness is the important requirement for the success of the situational leadership model. the appropriateness of a leadership style changes with change in the leadership environment. the model highlights on using more than one style of leadership especially when developing subordinates. according to this model, there is a no best leadership style since the key factors of leadership is the adaptation to the job maturity and the proficiency level of the subordinates.",leadership,"Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management Sao Paulo, Brazil, April 5 - 8, 2021","teams m. m. manyuchi department of quality and operations management, faculty of engineering and the built environment, university of johannesburg, south africa mercy.manyuchi@gmail.com n. sukdeo department of operations and quality management, faculty of engineering and the built environment, university of johannesburg, south africa nsukdeo@uj.ac.za","References

33,Cyclic Steam Stimulation Designing For Two Horizontal Wells  Mahmoud Zohair And Tagwa A. Musa,": thermal methods are the most used eor methods. thermal processes can reduce viscosity of heavy oil and residual oil saturation to improve mobility and achieve an economic recovery. cyclic steam stimulation (css) is one of the thermal methods, which has faster production, lower costs and lower pressure operations. the main objective of this paper is to find the optimum well location and injection parameters of the css process of two horizontal wells in sandstone reservoirs in order to increase the sweep efficiency and improve the production from this field. the field is one of heavy oil fields with low api of 17.7 and high oil viscosity of 3800 cp at 29o c. optimum css parameters and several simulation models for different development scenarios have been built using an advanced thermal eor simulator. many scenarios have been conducted with different parameters and conditions, and compared to study the feasibility of applying css in horizontal wells. the designing model and prediction of future performance up to 2030 show that, implementation of css in two horizontal wells with optimum location and optimum css parameters can give additional 11.4 % recovery factor compared to cold 10 vertical wells. the final optimum result shows that oil recovery could be improved from 24.29 % by 10 cold vertical wells to 35.7 % by css in the two horizontal wells.","horizontal wells, css","and Recommendations Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management Sao Paulo, Brazil, April 5 - 8, 2021","petroleum engineering department, sudan university of science and technology (sust), khartoum, sudan mahmoud.alkarimy@gmail.com , hushamali66@gmail.com, tagwam@gmail.com husham a. a. elbaloula petroleum engineering department, sudan university of science and technology (sust), khartoum, sudan now at state university of campinas (unicamp), campinas, sp, brazil hushamali66@gmail.com,","References:

34,Systematic Proposal For Risk Hierarchy In Decision Support  For The Implementation Of Industry 4.0 Concepts In The Oil,"the adoption of industry 4.0 concepts by companies is causing profound changes in all sectors, marked by the emergence of new business models, remodeling of production, consumption, transportation and delivery systems [11]. society also expects the transformation of industrial production to achieve achievements in the three dimensions of sustainability, namely economic, environmental and social [8]. on the other hand, the adoption of industry 4.0 concepts implies risks and challenges for society, such as job losses and changes in educational standards [9]. although there is no consensus recommendation on the pace of industry 4.0 deployment, it seems peaceful that the production chain of the oil and gas industry is lagging behind in this process when compared to other industrial sectors [5]. decision support systems have been the subject of active research by organizations for their development [6], while important measures have been widely used as decision support indicators, such as information and risk analysis [4]. considering this demand, the present research seeks to evaluate how professionals of the oil and gas industry production chain rank the risks, based on the economic, social, environmental, technical and legal dimensions, when making the decision for the implementation of industry 4.0 concepts. from the risk model for industry 4.0 within the context of sustainability, developed by birkel et al. [2], identified after bibliographic research and complemented by other authors [1,3,7,8,9,10,11,12], all consulted in the scopus database, a likert questionnaire was developed that allowed a qualitative assessment of the degree of relevance of each risk. in order to ensure the qualification and significance of the sample, the questionnaire was sent only to professionals from oil and parapetroleum companies with experience in technology and/or innovation. the use of the sampling strategy for convenience described resulted in 103 questionnaires answered, out of a universe of 536 requests for completion forwarded. the analysis methodology consisted of using descriptive statistics, comparing data between groups of respondents and conducting non- parametric statistical tests, since the data subject to analysis were categorical, that is, nominal and ordinal. in this way, research in determining how deployment risks are hierarchical will serve as a decision support resource in management. the originality of the research lies in the possibility, analyzing the academic impact, of a new perspective of understanding the risks in the decision-making process for the implementation of industry 4.0 concepts within the oil and gas industry production chain.","decision support, industry 4.0, oil industry, brazil",,"and gas industry production chain carlos eduardo de lemos monteiro and osvaldo luiz gonçalves quelhas master's and doctorate program in production engineering engineering school universidade federal fluminense rio de janeiro, brazil carlos_monteiro@id.uff.br osvaldoquelhas@id.uff.br","References

39,Measuring Patient Satisfaction In Military Health Care  Facilities,"delivering high-quality services is crucial in service industry success. that is the reason why patient satisfaction in hospitals is an important research topic. health services in developing countries are no exception, with high demand and significant budgetary restrictions. the widely accepted quality of service dimensions - tangibility, empathy, reliability, responsiveness, and assurance - have been studied to understand their impact on patient satisfaction; however, its application in every context is debatable, especially in circumstances where the patient cannot choose widely between different services. the military health care facilities in developing countries are one of those contexts; therefore, it is necessary to identify the specific dimensions of a quality service that contributes to patient satisfaction in them. this study aims to reveal factors associated with patient satisfaction that may be useful for military organizations in developing countries. to meet the objective of the study, the authors collected surveys of 2,606 users of military health care facilities. the analysis was performed in two phases. first, confirmatory factor analysis is carried out to validate the goodness of the proposed measurement model. second, the effects of the variables of the measurement model on an overall satisfaction variable are analyzed. for the first phase, a structural equation model analysis based on covariance (cb-sem) is used, and for the second phase, a structural equation model based on variance (pls-sem) is applied. in total, seven indicators are included in the measurement model. the results of cb-sem propose that the data are adjusted to three components, namely: appointment scheduling service, human resources quality, and medical support services. regards the global adjusted of the model, the quality measures of the exact fit show that the chi2 statistic is significant (92.0, df = 11, p-value < .001), and all indexes show a satisfactory fit. the values of gfi (.986), tli (.974), and rmsea (.054) are satisfactory (their values tend to 1 and > .5); additionally, the index srmr (.025) indicates the acceptable fit (<.08). the analysis with pls-sem indicates the constructs measurement reliability (all composite reliabilities > .8) as well as convergent validity (all ave > .5) and discriminant validity (htmt < .9 for all relationships between variables). moreover, the result of the analysis of the structural model indicates that the three latent variables of the model explain the variance of the overall satisfaction (r2 = .34); the path coefficients for appointment scheduling service, human resources quality, and medical support services are .13, .40, and .15, respectively. a bootstrapping procedure indicated that all these effects are significant (p-values < .001). in conclusion, on the one hand, these findings highlight the assessment of the patient concerning the human dimensions in military health proceedings of the international conference on industrial engineering and operations management sao paulo, brazil, april 5 - 8, 2021 © ieom society international 477",,,"ari mariano-melo and simone borges department of production engineering university of brasilia brasilia, cep 70910-900, brazil mktmariano@gmail.com, simone_simao@yahoo.com patricio ramírez-correa school of engineering catholic university of the north coquimbo, 1781421, chile patricio.ramirez@ucn.cl","References

40,Contributions To The Development Of Suppliers In Competitive  Environments: A Case Study In Brazilian Companies,"the purpose of this paper was to identify through a systematic literature review the relevant supplier development (sd) practices and the supplier evolution concept in the last three decades. the literature review identified the relevant sd concepts, which figure out a proposed conceptual framework to depict the supplier development process in a holistic way, and its expanded version aims to help organizational managers develop their strategic suppliers. the method used was a systematic literature review ranged from 01/01/1999 until 30/06/2018. the obtained results show us that the supplier's development concepts presented an evolutionary process over time, undergoing a paradigm shift from a transaction-oriented way to a relation-oriented relationship. the proposed expanded framework resulting from this work aims to favor managers to direct their suppliers' practices better. the analysis of the results obtained indicates that the purchasing companies and their suppliers need to intensify the long-term relationships between them to face the challenges promoted by the intense use of new technologies induced by iiot.",koren (2010),,"luiz de freitas ayres departamento de produção e sistemas - dps universidade do minho - campus de gualtar - braga id6889@alunos.uminho.pt maria sameiro carvalho departamento de produção e sistemas - dps - centro algoritmi universidade do minho - campus de gualtar - braga sameiro@dps.uminho.pt paulo sampaio departamento de produção e sistemas - dps - centro algoritmi universidade do minho - campus de gualtar - braga paulosampaio@dps.uminho.pt antonio henriques de araújo júnior department of production engineering, rio de janeiro,state university, rio de janeiro, brazil anthenriques2001@yahoo.com.br","References

41,Enterprise Resource Planning (Erp): An Exploratory  Literature Review Using Latent Dirichlet Allocation,"an enterprise resource planning (erp) system is a comprehensive packaged software solution composed of several configurable modules that integrate, firmly and in one single system, the core business activities through the automatization of information flows and the use of a shared database. in the process of integration of the packaged are incorporated the best practices, to facilitate the decision making, to reduce costs and to improve the directive control, and eventually, to reach the efficient and effective use of the enterprise resources. the scientific interest in erp systems began around the year 2000, and since then, several authors have proposed research agendas associated with this technology; however, as far as we know, there is not an analysis of the evolution of these agendas. in this context, this study aims to explore the research topics in erp systems and determine trends associated with them. this study uses data extracted from articles published between 2002 and 2019 in information system journals incorporated in wos. the total number of studies for this exploration was 231; all of them contain “enterprise resource planning” in their title or abstract. the research consisted of three steps that included, first, preprocessing of titles and abstracts, second, determination of topics with latent dirichlet allocation (lda), and third, trend analysis. the preprocessing involved tokenization, stemming, and stop-word removal. lda is a topic modeling method, unsupervised and probabilistic, that extracts topics from a document collection. lda analyzes the words in each document and calculates the joint probability distribution between the words observed and the hidden structure unobserved of the topics. this study identified a local minimum of perplexity (= 246.8) with a classification in 18 topics. this number of topics is near to the number of topics indicated in the erp research agendas. in order to analyze the research trends, a model based on five topics was used (perplexity = 376.4). this choice is the result of the revision of the models of 2 to 18 topics. in the case of topic1, the five most frequent tokens are implement*, enterpris*, culture*, assimil*, and technolog*; consequently, it is labeled cultura&implementation. for topic2, the five most frequent tokens are implement*, firm*, enterpris*, technolog*, and organ*; therefore, it is labeled implementation. the five most frequent tokens for topic3 are cloud*, trust*, cost*, profit*, and vendor*; thus, it is labeled markets. in the case of topic4, the five most frequent tokens are user*, enterpris*, perceive*, satisfact*, and train; accordingly, it is labeled users. finally, the five most frequent tokens for topic5 are busi*, enterpris*, company, integr*, and oper*; therefore, it is labeled operation. lastly, the trend analysis indicates that the studies on users and markets are on the increase, and on the other hand, those on implementation and operation decrease. the conclusions of the study indicate that there is a trend in erp research, which leaves behind technical elements associated with implementation and operation and focuses on socio- technological issues. since this study is an exploration, the findings should be taken carefully. proceedings of the international conference on industrial engineering and operations management sao paulo, brazil, april 5 - 8, 2021 © ieom society international 492",,,"ari mariano-melo department of production engineering university of brasilia brasilia, cep 70910-900, brazil mktmariano@gmail.com patricio ramírez-correa school of engineering catholic university of the north coquimbo, 1781421, chile patricio.ramirez@ucn.cl","References

42,Music Streaming Acceptance In Brazil: A Study Using  Structural Equations,"with the rise of access to mobile internet and the reduced cost for service over the last years, streaming services have replaced the way people access music over the internet. music is an integral part of most peoples, lives, with a global average of 2.5 hours a day spent listening to music. of these total 17.8 average hours a week, 86% of the music consumption is by streaming music. as the ipfi global music report explains, streaming services accounted for less than us$0.1 billion of the global music industry revenue in 2005; this is in contrast with 2018, where this industry accounts for us$8.9 billion, accounting for 47% of the industry’s revenues, with paid services being a 37% and ad-supported streams a 10% of the total revenue. in this context, this study examines the applicability of a model based on the hedonic information system framework to music streaming acceptance in brazil. this framework is an extension of the technology acceptance model to a hedonic context. an online survey based on scales of individual acceptance variables was used to measure the acceptance of spotify by a sample of 51 brazilian users. the partial least squares (pls) technique was used to analyze the measurement and structural model. the scales translated into portuguese were based on studies previous. all the items were quantified using a 7-point likert-type scale. the research model considers four variables, perceived ease of use (peou), perceived usefulness (pu), perceived enjoyment (pe), and behavioral intention (bi). the model proposes that bi is explained by the other variables; besides, peou explains both pu and pe. the reliability and validity of the measurement models were computed taking into account the recommendations of the literature. the latent variable discriminant validity was confirmed using the fornell–larcker test and the heterotrait– monotrait test. also, the srmr of .9 confirming the consistency of the general estimated model. after the pls estimation, a bootstrapping procedure was performed. bootstrapping is a nonparametric procedure that permits testing the statistical significance of pls results. peou affects both pu and pe; the relationship peou->pu has a beta of .536 (p-value <.001), and the relationship peou->pe has a beta of .649 (p-value < .001). nevertheless, bi is only affected by peou; the relationship peou->bi has a beta of .367 (p- value = .015), the relationship pu->bi has a beta of .221 (p-value = .134), and the relationship pe->bi has a beta of .108 (p-value = .511). in short, the structural results indicated that the model poorly explains the behavioral intention in the adoption of music streaming in brazil. specifically, 35.4% of the variable behavioral intention is explained by the variable perceived ease of use; the variables perceived enjoyment and perceived usefulness have not significant effect on behavioral intention. in conclusion, this study is not enabled to support that the hedonic information system framework is applicable to music streaming acceptance in brazil. proceedings of the international conference on industrial engineering and operations management sao paulo, brazil, april 5 - 8, 2021 © ieom society international 494",,,"ari mariano-melo department of production engineering university of brasilia brasilia, cep 70910-900, brazil mktmariano@gmail.com patricio ramírez-correa and catalina ramírez-rivas school of engineering universidad catolica del norte coquimbo, 1781421, chile patricio.ramirez@ucn.cl, catalina.ramirez@alumnos.ucn.cl","References

43,Perspectives Of Circular Value Networks In Ecuador,"the circular value network is based on the cyclic integration of the flows of materials, information, finances, knowledge and innovation of the actors that compose it. the purpose of this work is to analyze the perspectives of circular value networks in ecuador, from their principles and limitations. in addition, measures are proposed to increase the application of this concept in the country. a three-stage methodology was developed to map, diagnose and analyze the circular economy approach in the network through three checklists. as a result, limitations were identified for good practices; which focus on traditional business models, lack of ecological culture and few incentives in public policies. in addition, due to the high volume and variety of raw materials handled by the chains studied, its participants do not consider reuse or recycling to be an imperative necessity. the theoretical contribution of this research is the contextualization of the trend of the circular economy in the country; and from the methodological point of view; the definition of tools for its application in current contexts.","value chain, circular economy, brazil, april 5 - 8","At present, philosophies aimed at the circular economy and its management in the value network is a key factor when it comes to improving the competitiveness of any chain and the actors that compose it. In this investigation the practical presence of this approach in Ecuador was analyzed; through a holistic study with three diagnostic tools in an agro-food chain. The adoption of the best practices to the agro-food sector will be a key factor that will contribute to increasing the levels of innovation, information management and design of value-added products. This change should present as a basis the training of personnel in basic skills for the execution of this philosophy in business practice. In future research, we propose to continue the study of the circular economy and promote the development of a tool that evaluates the network of circular value through comprehensive indicators. 5.","ana julia acevedo urquiaga industrial engineering program university foundation san mateo bogotá, colombia anajacevedo@sanmateo.edu.co; anajuliaa@gmail.com neyfe sablón cossío postgraduate institute production and services group (proserv) technical university of manabí portoviejo, ecuador nsabloncossio@gmail.com; nsablon@utm.edu.ec marina bouzon federal university of santa catarina florianópolis, brazil marinabouzon@gmail.com josé antonio acevedo suárez logistic and production management laboratory (logespro) havana technological university “josé antonio echevarría” (cujae) havana, cuba acevedo@tesla.cujae.edu.cu carlos manuel taboada rodriguez logistics performance laboratory, department of production and system engineering university federal of santa catarina florianópolis, brazil carlos.taboada@ufsc.br",
44,Women In Postgraduate Programs Of Engineering And  Natural Sciences: A Case Study In Brazil,"women are often under-represented in academic and professional fields of engineering and natural sciences. retaining and strengthening them in these postgraduate programs is one of the most effective measures for promoting gender equality in the field. however, there is a lack of studies defining and analyzing the profiles and needs of these women. in 2018, we collected data about 916 women at the best university of south america, through an official request of information followed by an online survey. the results show they are between 21 and 30 years old, single, do not have children, and are strongly dependent on their scholarship income. the desire to become a professor/scientist motivated them to enter the program. the campus of their postgraduate program is not the same where they did their graduations, and their families do not live in the same town of their campus. one-third of them declared they want to have children in the medium-term. it is surprising that 65.12% refused to answer questions about their social status as postgraduate students, despite being informed that the survey was anonymous. this may indicate that being a woman doing a postgraduate program in engineering or sciences is a taboo in brazil.","women, higher education, engineering, natural sciences",,"isotilia costa melo department of production engineering são carlos engineering school (eesc)/university of são paulo (usp) avenida trabalhador sancarlense, 400 – 13566-590 – são carlos (sp) - brazil isotilia@usp.br, isotilia@gmail.com érica gonçalves rezende department of production engineering são carlos engineering school (eesc)/university of são paulo (usp) avenida trabalhador sancarlense, 400 – 13566-590 – são carlos (sp) - brazil ericagr@usp.br, ericagr@gmail.com daisy aparecida do nascimento rebelatto department of production engineering são carlos engineering school (eesc)/university of são paulo (usp) avenida trabalhador sancarlense, 400 – 13566-590 – são carlos (sp) - brazil daisy@sc.usp.br","References

45,Digital Capabilities To Support Digital Product-Service  Systems,"the advent of digital technologies enabled new product service systems (psss) grounded by digital capabilities, i.e. digital pss. although the literature has already begun to explore some cases of pss offerings supported by digital technologies, it remains a considerable gap about the role of digital ca- pabilities in new pss solutions provided by product firms. in this context, the purpose of this study is to answer the important question: how digital capabilities support different types of psss? following cusumano’s et al. (2014) division of pss offerings according to the role of service, i.e. smoothing, adapting and substituting, we conducted interviews in brazilian companies representing these types of pss. these cases were selected because the pss offerings were supported by digital technologies. our findings show that the digital capabilities can have different implications in pss and that their im-portance variates according to the role of services in adding value to the digital pss offering. particular-ly, product monitoring digital capabilities were highlighted as relevant for all types of psss, while optimization and autonomy digital capabilities were stated as important only to higher value-added offers.","servitization, brazil",,"daisy valle enrique department of electromechanical engineering university of beira interior covilha, portugal daisy.v.enrique@ubi.pt lucas santos dalenogare grenoble-inp génie indutriel institut polytechnique de grenoble grenoble, france lucas.santos-dalenogare@grenoble-inp.fr laura visintainer lerman department of industrial engineering federal university of rio grande do sul porto alegre, brazil laura.lerman@ufrgs.br alejandro germán frank department of industrial engineering federal university of rio grande do sul porto alegre, brazil frank@producao.ufrgs.br","References

46,Requirements Of Industry 4.0 From Heavy Automotive  Manufacturing,"industry 4.0 is already a reality in the industrial environment, even though it is not fully applied. the objective of this study is to raise the necessary requirements for the implementation process of industry 4.0 in the context of heavy automotive manufacture. for this, the study was developed through a literature review on the subject industry 4.0, a survey of the requirements of the heavy automotive industry and its prioritization, based on the relationship with technologies associated to industry 4.0, using an approach adapted from the quality function deployment (qfd) tool. the manufacturing requirements were validated with specialists from the automotive industry who also contributed to their prioritization regarding their degree of importance. the results show that some technologies of industry 4.0 presented a much higher degree of prioritization related to the others, being mandatory for a manufacturing project. thus, the present work can contribute to practitioners unfolding the principles of industry 4.0 in manufacturing requirements, which can be used in the design of new heavy automotive assembly lines and, in addition, the findings contribute to the literature on industry 4.0 filling extant theoretical gaps.","iiot, industry 4.0","The present study contributes to deepening the research in the area of Industry 4.0, applied to the automotive industry, since the subject is new and the available literature is still scarce with few cases of practical application of technologies in this type of industry. From a practical point of view, it was possible to demonstrate that the adaptation of the QFD tool, can be used for strategic prioritization of Industry 4.0 technologies, according to its requirements, in a very easy and fast way. The use of this tool can be extended to other industries, as long as the requirements are known and classified in order of importance. As limitations of this work, the facts of having been carried out within the scope of the automotive industry are disregarded, therefore subject to its particularities. Still, a single case study was carried out, in a company whose knowledge about the technologies, their difficulties and even the costs of implementation are still little known. As opportunities for future studies, the tool can be applied in other case studies to consolidate its use. In addition, it is important to deepen studies regarding the costs and difficulties of implementing Industry 4.0, including technology and service providers as sources of knowledge (Paslauski et al., 2016, 2017). 5","jânio vaz bragança department of industrial engineering federal university of rio grande do sul porto alegre, brazil braganca@gmail.com lucas santos dalenogare grenoble-inp génie indutriel institut polytechnique de grenoble grenoble, france lucas.santos-dalenogare@grenoble-inp.fr maria auxiliadora canarozzo tinoco department of industrial engineering federal university of rio grande do sul porto alegre, brazil maria@producao.ufrgs.br laura visintainer lerman department of industrial engineering federal university of rio grande do sul porto alegre, brazil laura.lerman@ufrgs.br alejandro germán frank department of industrial engineering federal university of rio grande do sul porto alegre, brazil frank@producao.ufrgs.br",
47,E-Commerce: Compared Efficiency Of Major Retailers In  Brazil And Canada,"retail e-commerce (b2c - business-to-customer) grows more in developing markets than in developed ones, however, most studies in the area were aimed at developed markets. this thesis aimed to compare the relative efficiency of publicly traded companies that operate in the retail of physical products online in a developed market (canada) and another in development (brazil), separately, and to discuss the practices of each market. to this end, a new instrumental approach was proposed, based on an integrated model of data envelopment analysis (dea) and optimal control theory (oct) to measure the efficiency of total inventory costs, based on the theory lean management, integrating the concept of capacity efficiency (i.e., management of physical assets). also, the model directly incorporated inflation and, indirectly, the gross margin. the model was applied to public data from two sets of companies classified as retail (var) or non-durable clothing and consumer goods (vbcnd) - one composed of 12 canadian companies (ca) and another by 17 brazilian companies (br) -, during the period from 2016 to 2019. then, a qualitative analysis of the b2c of the companies was made. the results showed that, in both countries, var companies were more efficient than vbcnd. there are indications that br companies were at a more advanced stage of the digital transition. in brazil, var companies prioritized sales by app and marketplace (own or third parties) and vbcnd companies, by app and virtual store. in canada, var companies have prioritized virtual stores and apps, while vbcnd, marketplaces (third parties), and apps. although it is a common practice for br var companies, no observed ca company controls a marketplace. in brazil, there was a strategy in which two companies operated in parallel, one specialized in b2c and the other in physical retail, though they were not more efficient than the market. the results pointed to br companies magazine luiza, arezzo, estrela, and via varejo as market benchmarks, so their best practices should be studied.",e-commerce,,"isotilia costa melo department of production engineering são carlos engineering school (eesc)/university of são paulo (usp) avenida trabalhador sancarlense, 400 – 13566-590 – são carlos (sp) - brazil isotilia@usp.br, isotilia@gmail.com paulo nocera alves junior luiz de queiroz college of agriculture (esalq)/ university of são paulo (usp) av. pádua dias, 11 – 13418 -900 piracicaba (sp) - brazil pnalvesjr@usp.br daisy aparecida do nascimento rebelatto department of production engineering são carlos engineering school (eesc)/university of são paulo (usp) avenida trabalhador sancarlense, 400 – 13566-590 – são carlos (sp) - brazil daisy@sc.usp.br",
48,A Novel Technique Of Simheuristic For The Irregular Cutting  Stock Problem With Free Rotations,"the cutting stock problem is a classic problem of combinatorial optimization. however, the variant of the problem with two-dimensional irregular items has been scarcely explored. in this problem, the items have a free shape and must be located within a set of identical sheets with fixed dimensions. the main objective is to minimize waste, which is the same as reducing the number of bins where a specific demand for objects can fit. in this work, the items can be rotated freely and be placed without a fixed orientation; this allows the solution of this problem to be more consistent with the different applications in the industry where it appears. the literature proposes classical techniques of column generation and metaheuristics. however, integrate column generation procedure and simulation environment using the unity engine is novel. the methodology considers a column generation procedure to select the subset of sheets composing the solution. an auxiliary problem will create each of the proposed bins to be given to the master problem as columns. through a two-phase construction procedure, the slave problem is solved. with the unity engine, a local search with exchange and insertion operators is implemented. the proposed technique was validated with instances from the literature of cutting stock problem. new best-known solutions were obtained for three different test cases. compared to previous works, the computing time is satisfactory and reasonable. in general terms, the methodology presents successful proceedings of the international conference on industrial engineering and operations management sao paulo, brazil, april 5 - 8, 2021 © ieom society international 535",,,"andrés de-las-casas and david álvarez-martínez department of industrial engineering, faculty of engineering universidad de los andes bogotá, colombia ag.de10@uniandes.edu.co, d.alvarezm@uniandes.edu.co gustavo gatica universidad andrés bello chile ggatica@unab.cl luis miguel escobar-falcón program of systems engineering universidad libre pereira, colombia luism.escobarf@unilibre.edu.co rubén iván bolaños and césar augusto marín-moreno research, development & innovation department integra s.a. pereira, colombia rbolanos@integra.com.co, cmarin@integra.com.co",

51,Behavioral Model Of Solid Waste Separation: An Empirical  Study In The Federal District,"the effective selective collection of urban solid waste in a city is fundamentally due to the positive behavior of individuals from that society. therefore, the aims of this study was to propose steps to maximize engagement in relation to participation in the system of selective collection by federal district’s population. in order to achieve this goal, it is important to know the variables that lead to this type of behavior, given that the human being is subject to several factors that influence him. thus, a method of structural equations was applied, using smartpls (smart partial least square), through a quantitative exploratory research. a questionnaire was applied to 120 people from the federal district. as a result of this research, a validated and reliable model, with a composed reliability indicator of 0,895, that explains behavior by 47,2% was obtained. the variable that most contributed to the prediction of waste separation behavior was the perceived behavioral control, responsible for 27,8% contribution to the explained variance of the endogenous variable. finally, a behavioral mobilization strategy was proposed, integrating the pillars of awareness, strategic facilitation and transparency into an action plan that is the basis for the development of pro-environmental behavior.","recycling, waste separation",,"ari mariano-melo department of production engineering university of brasilia brasilia, cep 70910-900, brazil mktmariano@gmail.com patricio ramírez-correa school of engineering catholic university of the north coquimbo, 1781421, chile patricio.ramirez@ucn.cl felipe moutinho de oliveira department of production engineering university of brasilia brasilia, cep 70910-900, brazil moutinhoofelipe@gmail.com",
52,Effects Of Voltage Sags On Industrial Processes:  Case Study,"a voltage dip (or sag) is a sudden reduction in the supply voltage on one or more phases to a value between 90% and 1% of the reference voltage followed by a voltage recovery shortly afterward. in recent years, interruptions, or failures in manufacturing processes due to the poor quality of energy supplied have attracted the interest of industrial consumers, mainly because these events represent significant financial losses to the industrial sector. the failure of some equipment can lead to a partial or total shutdown of the production chain. in this context, this paper shows a study of the case of a supervisory system that can estimate the process immunity time (pit) of a machine. the estimation process considers pit values of each equipment that participates in the operational control of the machine, their supportability curves to voltage sags, and their respective connections (serial, parallel, etc.). the results show that the supervisory system is a useful tool to assist planners during decision-making to reduce operating costs.","voltage sags, comfort","The development of a program capable of generating the total time of support to the voltage sags, coming from the electricity distribution network, is essential to keep the productive process efficient, without stoppings and, consequently, without repeated sets up. The immunity of an industrial process allows to analyse its operational continuity during a voltage sag. Different processes or similar processes may have different characteristics, thus, to identify the immunity of a process, it is necessary to identify the most critical equipment within a process. The process immunity time - PIT defines the operational inertia of the production process with respect voltage sags. PIT is quantified after the failure of the equipment that controls the process. Process immunity is directly proportional to the PIT value. In this way, the development of this programming allows the visualization of the total time of support of the process, being able to assist corrective and preventive actions to reduce financial losses with respect to unexpected production stoppings caused by voltage sags. 5.

55,Selection Of Appropriate Maintenance Strategy For Oil And  Gas Equipment Using Analytical Hierarchy Process (Ahp),"the maintenance strategy is becoming increasingly critical with the increasing competition in the oil and gas industrial environment due to hundreds pieces of equipment, which operate continuously under rigorous operational conditions resulting from over pressures and fluctuated temperatures. many pieces of equipment usually subject to an inspection and maintenance during normal operation of a plant. however, others pieces cannot be inspected and maintained during normal operation of plant unless plant facilities are totally subjected to shutdown to avoid huge production losses in the company. therefore, the study proposed in this work was to select appropriate maintenance strategies that could be divided into four alternative: preventive maintenance (pm), corrective maintenance (cm), predictive maintenance (pdm) and turnaround maintenance (tam) to arrange inspection and maintenance scheduling for all pieces of equipment in the oil and gas plant based on four criteria: safety, production, cost and availability associated with goal of analytical hierarchy process (ahp) approach. the result is to decrease in the cost of maintenance and production losses and maximize availability and efficiency of oil and gas plant facilities.",,"In this work, appropriate maintenance strategy of heat exchanger is identified according to Safety, Production, Cost and availability criteria resulting from AHP approach application. Four maintenance policies are considered; PM, CM, PdM and TAM. This work shows that TAM is the most appropriate maintenance strategy for heat exchanger used in the oil and gas industries. In the future, AHP approach can be used for other equipment in the same sectors. Therefore, AHP approach is a tool to help management in the decision making. This work can also be added a fuzzy logic and risk-based inspection models in the selection of appropriate maintenance strategy for other pieces of equipment of oil and gas plants.",abdelnaser elwerfalli college of mechanical engineering technology benghazi – libya gq7qg@yahoo.com souad al-maqespi college of mechanical engineering technology benghazi – libya souad1973.2014@gmail.com,
56,Evaluation Of Efficiency Trends In The Brazilian Construction  Industry,"the brazilian construction industry has been marked by many fluctuations in performance in recent years. in 2009, it was directly affected by the economic crisis, and the sector suffered a severe recession, followed by a slight recovery. by characterizing this sensitivity to the variations of the economy, the sector is closely linked with country's development. this work performs an analysis of the reflection of these constant oscillations in the performance of companies that operate in the brazilian civil construction sector in the period 2005-2015. this study is based on data envelopment analysis (dea) models, and malmquist index of total factor productivity (tfp). the tfp malmquist index is used to calculate the change in total factor productivity over the period breaking it down into variations of technical and scale efficiency as well as technological progress. results show that for the analyzed constructors set, regression in the overall and pure technical efficiency could be evaluated. it could also be observed that most companies operate outside their optimal market scale and that efficiency scores and changes in total factor productivity decreased between 2005 and 2015.","civil construction, efficiency",,"carlos ernani fries and daniel holstak department of production and systems engineering federal university of santa catarina florianópolis, sc, brazil carlos.fries@ufsc.br, danielholstak@gmail.com",

60,Triple Helix Relations And Patent Deposition In Innovation  Projects At A Large Brazilian University,"innovation nowadays is one of the most important factors for any company's long-term success, economic development, or technological and scientific advances. in brazil, the investments in research and development are mostly public, counting on government support in incentives and specific legislation to foment innovation. among the many factors that influence innovative projects' development are the triple helix relations, which are established among universities, industry, and government. the entrepreneurial university is the main institution of this model as it represents the largest source of knowledge needed to stimulate technological advancement and entrepreneurship. in this scenario, this study aimed to analyze the triple helix relations into science, technology, and innovation support institutions linked to a federal university in brazil. the project consisted of analyzing each triple-helix actor's impact in historical data of innovation projects conducted by the university center. as a result, the government sphere's strong presence was identified as the main conductor of the innovation process, followed by a university culture of research and entrepreneurship in development and industry not as active as it was expected.",triple helix,"The main scientific contribution of this research is that in an emergent country like Brazil, patents are not a focus of innovative efforts. The low rate of patents in industry-university projects suggests that businesses are run away from patents, but maybe trusting industrial secrets and intimate relationships among actors. Also, the high presence of short- term projects among industry and university shows a profile that jeopardizes patent deposition possibilities. Data also suggest that triple helix's projects outlined more patents. Qualitative data suggests that the whole context of the Brazilian market and regulatory issues contribute to academics and entrepreneurs' mutual mistrust for investing in patents. The conversion rate can be higher than the uncovered by this research once industrial and private partners, in general, can use the knowledge gathered in research projects to open new non-patent based business. An issue to investigate more in future works. This research has a practical implication for public decision making in Brazil and emergent countries. For having more technological-based business, maybe it will be better to fund triple helix partnerships.

65,The Effects Of Stakeholders Management On Risks: An It  Projects Analysis,"the literature indicates that inadequate communication with stakeholders and activities’ inherent uncertainties are some of the main causes of project failure. therefore, two essential areas of project management are risk management and stakeholder engagement plan. in this matter, this study aims to evaluate how stakeholders affects project risks and how they relate to project success from the understanding of concepts and management tools. four factors related to stakeholder management were defined as guides for the creation of eight scenarios, which resulted in different probabilities for three risk variables. nine interviews with it projects experts and specialists on project management education were conducted to obtain opinions on the proposed scenarios. the consistency of responses was verified by the delphi method and by the coefficient of variation. the statistical method of design of experiments was applied, using minitab® software, for the construction of the research instrument and for data analysis. therefore, the effects of the factors ‘stakeholder register’, ‘stakeholder engagement’, ‘communication with stakeholders’, and ‘number of stakeholder groups’ on response variables ‘negative risk incidence’, ‘opportunities incidence’, and ‘development of contingency strategies’ were identified. results show that the engagement and communication with stakeholders have a significant influence in the occurrence of negative risks, in the occurrence of opportunities and in the development of contingency strategies for the analyzed scenarios.","technologies, and partnerships, among others","The inefficient risk management and the miscommunication with the people involved in the project are the main project failure causes (Gupta et al., 2019). The understanding and the integration of these two areas are essential to create innovative solutions and to the IT project effective development (Bernardo et al., 2015; Lehtinen and Aaltonen, 2020; Xia et al., 2018). Using the Design of Experiments method, this paper extended knowledge in this matter by highlighting the impact of stakeholder engagement and communication with stakeholders on negative risk incidence, on opportunities incidence and on development of contingency strategies. According to the experts and to the estimated models, these factors related to stakeholder management present the greater effects on risk management area and, thus, possibly in project success. The research did not include the synergy between stakeholders and risks, but it is also important to understand the actions that affect both areas simultaneously to increase the probability of project success.

73,Analysis Of Cost And Benefit On Safety Critical Systems  Jussara Pimenta Matos,"along with this analysis this paper presents the necessary parameters to put on data cost-benefit that all the procedures describes intent to establish technical directions when such events occurs on the matter. it is applied a systematic negotiation for conflicts resolution adopting guidelines and international standards. to achieve satisfactory reliability, availability, maintainability and safety requested, these factors must be considered in early stage of the system development. with the increasing the system complexity, there is a growing necessity for knowledge on the application of concepts regarding the most suitable architecture, in order to reduce costs and increased quality. then, this work aims to give a direction to the stakeholders regarding the choice of appropriate alternative structure considering the application domain by establishing a rational. this analysis is developed based on estimation methods and cost evaluation, using industry design standards and mathematical models to represent the analyzed systems and it is applied on the real case.",,"In a systematic way of negotiating conflicts, an evaluation of the costs and benefits associated with alternative architectures in a railway system, for the automatic train control subsystem. In analysis elaboration, adaptations are included, in order to propose a systematic, improving the way of driving and avoiding subjectivity in the judgment of the interested parties, in relation to the evaluated scenarios. The analysis is guided by RAMS concepts and the specific needs of critical security systems, to support both a quantitative and qualitative assessment of the architecture. This analysis proposal is not intended to be definitive and cover all possible conditions, but rather to support system managers and architects, for decision making between alternative architectures. Throughout the development of this work, relevant points that make up their contributions are identified. Good architecture documentation is crucial for the success of evaluation methods, especially regarding the diagrams and descriptors of architecture of a system, in order to organize the rationale adopted in its conduct [29], [30]. There is an initial effort in activities to redo the architecture documentation and to elaborate more significant scenarios for the operational issues of the system and in order to meet the different requests and changes. The possibility of a consensus among those interested in the scenario elicitation phase can result in architectural decisions that serve only those stakeholders with greater decision-making power, even when applying a negotiation system, this trend exists. The stakeholders involved have different levels of knowledge and before the assessment starts, this knowledge must be leveled. In addition, stakeholders are often unaware of the business rules and restrictions desired by an organization. A simulation of the projects to be developed would provide indirect gains to the system and the organization that carries it out, such as the dissemination of technical knowledge, business rules and organization guidelines. An organization needs information on how much it will have to invest to increase earnings, and to control and mitigate the risks in a project. This systematic way of conducting the definition of an architecture can support the identification of risks and quantification of gains. Architectural decisions have an associated cost, the calculation presented through ROI, can improve these decisions, clarifying and improving the uncertainty index. The difficulty in adopting the methods is the choice between the possible changes that can occur in a system. Selecting a subset of strategies is difficult. As the resources for building and maintaining a system are finite, a rational method is needed to support the choice of architecture options during the initial design and in the subsequent phases. Getting stakeholders to take over this process is essential. For future work, it is considered the need to carry out more simulations to refine the systematization of negotiation in the decision process and that the cost and benefit analysis can be compared with previous results, in order to improve the rationale to be adopted in other projects. In addition, they must be applied to other application domains, in critical security systems, in which case, the technical standards and concepts used as a","department of electrotechnical instituto federal de são paulo são paulo, sp jussara.pimenta@ifsp.edu.br",
74,A Mathematical Model For The Gamification Of The Decisionmaking Process Of A Representative Manufacturing System,"the path for a management professional to become a successful leader is often long and requires high investments in qualification courses. in order to reduce training efforts of professionals with strong management skills, management games involving dynamic decision-making practices in a competitive environment have been successfully employed. this paper presents a mathematical model of a management game that considers a typical manufacture system, which can be inserted in a more general game incorporating thus other sectors of a representative goods producer. the model includes those decisions and interrelations considered relevant for the production management at the shop floor level. in order to achieve this objective, a mathematical model capable to simulate a factory was developed considering a degree of realism consistent with those decision situations that a player undergoing training would face in practice: capacity and layout planning, line balancing, master production and scheduling planning, material planning, among others. other competitors, represented by other players with similar products and manufacturing systems, compete for the same market, creating a competitive environment that induces additional motivation to look for those decisions that promote advantages for the virtual companies they are managing. the dynamic decision process generated by the game tends to provide an environment of “learning by doing"", without prejudices in operations of a real shop floor. the insertion of the proposed model in a general management simulation model which includes supply management, marketing, logistics, costs and accounting allows the player to assess the impact of his decisions at the shop floor level over other sectors, especially in the accounting results report.","gamification, management games, shop floor game, fort lauderdale",,"abdul al-hasen broward county water and wastewater services fort lauderdale, fl, usa aalhasen@gmail.com carlos ernani fries and ismael peruzzo zamoner department of production and systems engineering federal university of santa catarina florianópolis, sc, brazil carlos.fries@ufsc.br, ipzamoner@gmail.com",
75,Production Improvement In Sme’S Enterprises Through  Lean: A Case Study,"the role of micro and small enterprises is very important for the economic development of the regions. this research work is an initial path towards a significant improvement in productivity, efficiency, lead time and waste in peruvian enterprises that must to improvement production and efficiency, increase productivity and eliminating wastes to reduce total production cost. this paper presents a case study of a micro enterprise dedicated to the manufacture and assembly of wooden desks that are distributed to the regional and national market. process times were taken to determine baseline indicators using the o-t diagram. the 5s methodology was implemented to reduce search times for materials and tools and movements of operators. activities were grouped that allowed reducing downtime and increasing production. in this sense, production flow was optimized thus reducing non value added activities. the results showed that reducing waste time, would enable the enterprise to improve production.","lean, production, takt time, lead time","Changing the number of operators affects not only the production capacity, but also the manufacturing unit cost. In this sense, adding operators to the process increases the production rate, but the marginal rate decreases with each additional operator (Figure 4). With each additional operator, the operating cost of the direct labor of the process is increased by the operator's salary. Figure 4. Increasing number of worker vs Capacity In order to achieve the result of producing 7 units/day, it has implied identifying the processes of the machines and those carried out by the workers. In this way, activities of high labor intensity have been determined to assign a greater number of workers. The total times obtained in table 5 considering four operators is achieved by incorporating two more operators for purely manual tasks, especially in the cutting stage: verification of measurements, selection of piece and calibration. Adopting takt time as a guide in production system helped to develop a production scenario that allowed to meet market demand. The production system still need to improve the variability and dynamics of the system. In the mentioned case study, it has been found that the reason for non-value added activities are due to wrong handling material, long distance to find a tool, defect product and waiting time. The enterprise has a production of 7 unit/day with the participation of 6 workers but process times are very tight and it must be readjusted by to meet market demand. Nowadays, the company has invested in training and tools. He has not planned to buy another bordering machine in the next two years. Micro and small enterprises are very important in the economic and sustainable development at the Lambayeque region (Ulloa et al., 2020). The case study in this paper showed that introduction of lean methods brought opportunities for improvements production and a best management. It can be concluded that O-T Diagram is an effective tool for identifying processing wastes.","maximiliano arroyo ulloa faculty of engineering universidad católica santo toribio de mogrovejo chiclayo, peru marroyo@usat.edu.pe lucía sánchez celis zur distribution food company lima, peru luvasace.212@gmail.com maira arroyo lujan management department decorlux-sac enterprises lima, peru maira.arroyo@decorlux.com.pe javier beltran reyes business intelligence department comercio-group lima, peru javier.beltran@comercio.com.pe",
76,Supplier Selection Using Technique For Order Of Preference  By Similarity To Ideal Solution (Topsis) Method: A Case,"selecting suppliers of goods for procurement becomes very complex because often a large number of criteria need to be considered and some of the criteria cannot be properly assessed. fluctuations in supplier performance and unknown information are always in decision making. choosing the right supplier can reduce operating costs, increase profitability and product quality, increase competitiveness in the market, and serve customers quickly. this study aims to propose a method that can facilitate practitioners to select suppliers logically and when uncertainty and/or unavailability of assessment information arises. we applied the multi-criteria decision making (mcdm) method to determine the best alternative from several alternatives based on certain criteria. the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (topsis) method is also used in several multiple attribute decision making (madm) models because this method has several advantages, namely the concept is simple and easy to understand. this research was conducted at a raincoat manufacturing company, namely pt. trijaya plastik. the main ingredient in making raincoats is pvc (polyvinyl chloride). due to the large number of suppliers who can provide goods, this study examines the selection of pvc suppliers for the company's main material. the result of normal topsis calculations in supplying the main raw material or pvc is the second supplier, namely pt. royal lapastek by considering 4 criteria, namely price evaluation, condition of ordered goods, delivery time, and administrative evaluation.","procurement, topsis","The results of calculations can be known that there is a difference in the results between calculations using TOPSIS normalization of distribution and normalization of an ideal. Based on the value of the index is obtained by normalizing the PT Royal Lapastek distribution on the first rank with an index value of 0.77, Inti Dragon peaked at second with an index value of 0.47, and PT Innan occupies the third position with an index value of 0.23. On the normalization of the ideal position of PT Royal Lapastek on the first rank with an index value of 0.80, the core of the second position with Inti Dragon index value of 0.48 and PT Innan occupies the third position with an index value of 0.20. From the results above, it can be seen that the normalization of both models is not happening between the rankings. This indicates that the result of the calculation of the normal TOPSIS so it can be concluded that the right supplier to supply the main raw materials or PVC the company is the second supplier is PT Royal Lapastek. This research gives only four main criteria to give judgment on the alternative, therefore further research can be done by adding to the number of criteria as well as using other methods.

78,Identification And Analysis Of Efficiency Drivers:  Evidences From Brazilian Airports,"the aim of this study is to identify and analyze efficiency drivers in international airports. to this end, a research was designed in three parts. the first part is an exploratory study of the literature, which supports a proposal for a representative structure of the typical operations of an international airport and allows the identification of 27 efficiency drivers implemented at airports in order to obtain the study objectives. the second part is a quantitative analysis of 33 brazilian international airports, which allows them to be classified into different levels of efficiency. for that, two analysis techniques were used: a two-stage data envelopment analysis (two-stage dea), which allowed the comparison of efficiency levels between airports; and the malmquist index (mi), which allows comparing levels of comparison over time. a third part of the research was a multiple case study that investigated the degree of implementation of the 27 practices at three airports selected for different levels of efficiency. evidence was found that confirms 16 out of 27 efficiency drivers.","airport operations, efficiency drivers",,"prof. paulo s. hollaender, msc and prof. antonio carlos pacagnella junior, pmp, phd school of applied sciences (fca) state university of campinas limeira, bra paulo.hollaender@gmail.com, acpjr@unicamp.br","References

79,"Traditional Ceremony ""Ndilo Wari Udan"" As A  Transcendental Communication Attraction For The Karo","indonesia has a multicultural culture and culture as ancestral heritage that must be preserved. culture can be used as a noble national identity. one of them is the karo tribe on the island of sumatra, especially north sumatra. the karo indigenous people still carry out their noble cultural rituals. because in the beginning before their religion existed, animism and dynamism or what was called parmalim were their beliefs. in this mini-research, the authors looked at the stretching culture of communication interactions carried out by the karo tribe to the creators who were able to control the rain by giving requests as outlined in rituals and prayers called ndilo wari udan. how transcendental communication is carried out by them to the creator as a form of interaction that can be seen from a communication perspective. this study looks at the perspective of transcendental communication, although rituals in communication interactions can also be seen from the cultural communication approach. the observations show that the traditional ceremonies performed by the karo tribe as a form of the karo community have a transcendental communication model towards their god. observations are made by looking at data taken from several sources, including videos and images published in online news, as well as non-commercial videos.",,"Transcendental communication is a form of vertical communication, carried out to God and supernatural beings. This transcendental practice is carried out by humans using media which is often referred to as religious rituals, such as prayer, dhikr which has spiritual value when doing it. Transcendence can be translated into two meanings of understanding in communication, the first is ritual which is considered as a transcendental communication medium that is concretely visible to the physical eye, such as dance, offerings, and prayer. We can see directly, then the two transcendent meanings felt by humans who interact with their God or supernatural beings. The sensations that are felt are difficult to translate into physical language. Because nature and spiritual experiences make interactions with different impressions.

82,Game Theory Supporting A Decision-Making Process To  Reduce Losses In Hydro Generating Plants Overhaul Delays,"overhaul maintenance stoppages for hydro-generating units must have their activities carefully planned to avoid delays in the execution schedule that affect power generation. however, usually postponements will proceedings of the international conference on industrial engineering and operations management sao paulo, brazil, april 5 - 8, 2021 © ieom society international 800",,"An application of game theory in the area of asset maintenance was presented in this paper. The theory was concerned with a delay problem in the overhaul schedule of the assets of a power generating plant. Then, under four types of possible strategies, a process of interaction between two power plants, which simulated two associate managers or players belonging to a business group, was modeled in order to verify the lowest possible financial loss to members among the options available for the solution of the overhaul schedule execution problem. The interaction between the players concerned the sharing of labor as a way to reduce the delay time of the overhaul. The game was then set up in a table containing the respective losses for each option presented. The viability of the players' strategies was assessed using the Max-min method in order to maximize the results of the columns where the overhaul plant was located and to minimize the results of the lines where the plant providing human resources was located. The result of the simulation of the game helped managers in decision making, showing that the best option is to share labor with the partner plant and also establish an outsourcing contract complementing the staff. The decision indicated by the method pointed to the lowest financial loss for the group of associate managers and a delay of only 4 days in the renovation schedule.

85,Improving Cycle Time Of Returnable Packaging Logistics                    Management In A Philippine Automotive,"the car industry in the philippines has been booming for the last five years. the country ranked ninth in the largest number of registered passenger cars across the asia-pacific region, and in 2019 sold around 273.4 thousand vehicles. relative to this, local customers pay an average of 1.0 to 1.3 million philippine pesos for a motor car. the company in the study is an automobile assembly plant, responsible for sales and distribution of automobiles and parts locally, and in other asean countries. this research was conducted to find out, what affects the cycle time of returnable packaging logistics materials. the study employed primary and secondary data. primary data were obtained through the deployment of the survey questionnaire, which was based on the cycle-time improvement guidebook – partnering for total quality by kanagal (1992); secondary data were provided by the company information system. respondents of the survey were one hundred and sixty-one (161) team members, from manager to interns, who were actively working at the time of the study at the returnable packaging logistics operation. percentage and weighted mean were used to compute data. findings showed that the team members need periodic education through training and skills upgrade to align to industry 4.0 concepts while providing process improvement activities to improve the operation’s cycle time. furthermore, the current information system of the organization needs to be upgraded with technology that can provide a proactive approach to the operation.",cycle time,"and the Way Forward In view of the discovery in the study, it is recommended that a re-orientation on all the procedures pertaining to returnable packaging be done. This will raise awareness on the part of all team members, after which, strict compliance may be enforced. It is also being recommended that the current information system be upgraded to a more responsive system; one that can provide real-time information, in harmony with physical inventory and one which is reliable for planning and forecasting. The Predictive Data Analytics Technology is one information system which may be considered to support the heavy requirements of the Returnable Packaging Logistics Operation. In order to prevent damages in the returnable packaging and sustain good performance, the following were recommended and currently installed; cushion on holding brackets to avoid module side panel damage and additional base support to avoid module bending damages as shown on figure 5 and a prevention holder to avoid swapping of Left-hand and Right-hand panel on figure 7. To prevent misplaced and loss of components, a component holder/hanger was designed as shown on figure 6 and sample photo on figure 7. Updating the labels of module types and maintaining the poka-yoke will improve the FIFO system.

86,Teaching Work Measurement Through Origami In  Developing Countries,,,"Generally, using origami in universities is far from a regular phenomenon, particularly because this art is not adequately marketed and many instructors are not aware of its implications for the development of learning experiences. Moreover, they tend to regard origami as child’s play. However, as this article showed, it helps to convey industrial engineering concepts without mentioning the joy of creating something yourself. Moreover, allow students to learn critical thinking, problem-solving and collaborative skills (PBL). Furthermore, solves a common problem in developing countries: lack of laboratories. Also, origami can be used to teach industrial engineering concepts in virtual education settings (e.g. during the COVID-19 lockdowns). Therefore, due to its visual and practical nature, origami- based instruction helps students from developing countries to see more easily the connections between origami projects and industrial engineering concepts. Although origami-based instruction has many benefits, it can also be challenging for industrial engineering instructors. First, origami-based instruction requires a lot of time from instructors for decisions regarding the generalization of concepts from an origami project. Second, the instructor should ensure that the student does not walk away with an incorrect understanding of the concept under analysis. Third, the learning curve for origami-based learning depends on the instructor, until he gets used to origami-based instruction. Thus, instructors would dismiss origami-based instruction because is easier to teach from textbooks that do not use PBL. Therefore, preparing origami-based instruction will increase the time needed to prepare the class, and needs extra effort by the instructor. Despite the limitations mentioned above, in developing countries, origami-based instruction offers new opportunities for the development of practical, cheap, and environmentally friendly learning experiences. Specifically, from an attitudinal perspective, it is clear that the students change when working on origami-based projects. Over the last five years, I have been using origami-based instruction to teach work measurement (and other industrial engineering concepts). As a consequence, I found that student analytical capabilities have increased as a result of working with Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management Sao Paulo, Brazil, April 5 - 8, 2021",,"References

87,Risk Map Elaboration In Safety Technological Educational:  Teaching Prevention Tool,"the risks within school area deserve attention because it is an important place for the formation of citizenship and the intellectual development. one must be concerned about the way in which school spaces are used by the educational institution community. for instance, verifying whether the environment is well-ventilated and provides adequate furniture in the workspaces. does an educational institution that is concerned with disseminating sustainability, also investing in the health and safety of its environments in order to be more secure? this article seeks to identify potential risks (environmental, behavioral and accidents), by elaborating occupational risks map. methodologically, this research is classified as qualitative, exploratory, by documentary research. this case study identifies risks in brazilian",,"It is a fact that there are potential risks present in study environments. Throughout the professional life of the occupational safety technician, he must be prepared to manage risks in order to guarantee his safety and that of his co- workers, as well as the environment in which he finds himself. Work safety applies to all segments / processes / environments. Evidently, each segment has its specific characteristics and risks, and exactly for that reason, each environment needs to be “taken care of”, like the study environments within a Teaching Institution. In this sense, the project was able to identify the different risks (environmental, behavioral and accidents), based on the elaboration of the Occupational Risks Map of the Chemistry Laboratory of Cefet/RJ. Bearing in mind that, the main function of the Risk Map is to signal the places where greater security is needed, alerting students and servants about the points where they should be more careful or even avoid. Another objective foreseen and achieved with the development of the project was to raise the necessary control and prevention measures for the selected environment, which in this case, stood out those of Replacement, Engineering Control, Signaling and the use of PPE. It should be considered that, currently, the risk control hierarchy, mentioned in this study, is addressed in the “new” NR-01 that deals with General Provisions and Risk Management, item 1.4.1, letter g, when it comes implementation of preventive measures, in order of priority. Some Regulatory Norms related to the elaboration of the Risk Map were also addressed, such as NR-05, which says that it is up to CIPA to do it and NR-09, which talks about the Environmental Risk Prevention Program (PPRA) and its objective of preserving the health and integrity of workers. NRs establish minimum protection requirements in the workplace, in order to prevent occupational accidents and diseases, preserving the health and safety of the community of the educational institution in question. Therefore, considering the importance that Cefet/RJ has been giving, through the development of extension and scientific initiation projects, in the dissemination of sustainability, especially when incorporating social, environmental and economic values and guiding principles of environmental strategies, both in disciplines taught as well as in the management of their physical structures; it is believed that the educational institution can invest in the health and safety of its environments so that they become more harmonious and safe, thus preventing potential risks. Considering the contributions of this research, how much: (i) the employee / administrative technician will feel more valued and tends to be more motivated at work, and yields more in the performance of the function; (ii) to the teacher, it will lead to a better quality of life, as well as a better condition for transmitting the content to students; (iii) students, more efficient learning and with lower risks; (iv) for the school, better results in school evaluations and reduction in the number of licenses of its professionals.

89,Analytic Study For Subsea Oil Production Optimization  Using Lean Concepts,"oil & gas production is intensive cost activity due to the high cutting-edge technologies and energy requirements. in addition to the global continuous increase in power demands and due to the correlation of oil prices with global events which makes the price vulnerable to rapid fluctuation; most oil and gas companies tend to increase the production for the same oil field above the initial forecasting limit to increase the total profit in terms of monetary value during the oil wells’ life. nevertheless, the oil overproduction has negative impacts on the company main assets such as wells equipment damage, high wells depletion rate, high power consumption, high wastewater, low product quality and adverse environmental impact; which will make the operation and maintenance cost to be much higher than the production increasing revenues. as the lean management system concepts and tools are well known in the oil and gas industry and already in use in several operations improvement projects. so, in this research, a new model is suggested to be readily used by any oil and gas company to solve the problem by using lean concepts and tools such as value stream mapping “vsm”, value analysis, method study and analytic hierarchy process “ahp” to eliminate wastes and concentrate the main values of the operations that lead ultimately to an acceptable increase in profits while not causing the mentioned overproduction problems.","lean, overproduction",,"hamdy ahmed abdel rahim prof. yehia m. youssef dr. mohamed h. mourad industrial and engineering management department faculty of engineering and technology arab academy for science technology and maritime transport hamdy.elreheem@rashpetco.com, yehia.youssef@staff.aast.edu mmourad@aast.edu","References

Nanomaterial applications in health care delivery seem to be drawing the attention of several researchers and forming changes in approach in addressing the current pandemic challenges. Remarkably, some of these materials are utilized for clinical, prevention, therapeutic interventions in the treatment of viral infections. Nanomaterials have considerably enhanced the fabrication of personal protective equipment such as face shield and mask respirators, gloves, surgical gowns, and test kits. Furthermore, due to their physicochemical properties, these materials are used for clinical diagnostics, therapeutic purposes, and vaccine development. However, significant progress has been achieved in furthering the prospect of nanomaterials in healthcare delivery. This recent pandemic affords nanomaterials vast opportunities in addressing its challenges. Nevertheless, the issue of toxicity remains a significant concern over the years, thus impeding the approval of relevant regulatory agencies. Additional studies are required to understand fully the toxicity impact and likely biomedical complications of these materials with a notion to address this issue.

96,Modernization Of Undergraduate Education Program  (Pmg),"the modernization of undergraduate education program (pmg) in brazil started in 2019 and it has 8-years long. this modernization program is supported by the fulbright commission in brazil, the u.s. embassy in brasilia, and the ministry of education, through brazilian federal agency for support and evaluation of graduate education (capes) and national council of education (cne). eight different engineering undergraduate programs were selected in this first edition aiming the modernization of the engineering education in brazil. one of the program objectives is making a strong collaboration network between usa and brazil looking for improvements in undergraduate programs in engineering education and the international tendencies in engineering areas. in order to succeed and to strengthen the internationalization of brazilian universities, the pmg will provide the resources to the mobility of brazilian and u.s. faculty and brazilian ph.d students. other objectives aim to promote the entrepreneurship, creativity, and innovation skills among engineering students. we understand these are competencies required by the companies to sustain competitiveness and to innovate in the market in a constant transformation. by this way, engineering schools need to generate new syllabus aligned to competencies of the present and the future and to put the engineering student in a leading role in the learning process, applying active learning methodologies as project-based learning, gamification, flipped learning and so on. these methodologies with the support of modern and digital educational technologies will bring the smart education to our context. then new facilities as smart classrooms and smart environments are needed to promote the active learning methodologies and to deliver to the smart society better engineers with the properly competencies. although, the competencies and skills assessments are not easy tasks. faculty members are encouraged and trained to apply innovative assessment methods and tools to evaluate competencies and skills instead only a set of contents. nevertheless, it is necessary to work in partnership with different levels of higher education, with the society, and with the productive sector to understand and update the engineering syllabus to fulfill the professional requirements. much of this may conflict with the federal educational rules, but innovative actions are outcoming from de pmg, so the national regulations around the brazilian engineering education must be updated if the brazilian engineering wants to have a leading position. each of eight of the undergraduate programs has initial results about their institutional modernization projects (imp) that are outcomes from the first two years of the pmg. some imps are running new curricula in their universities and launching online and hybrid programs whereas other are implementing active learning methodologies in the new smart classrooms. the partnerships between u.s. and brazilian universities are becoming stronger and many initiatives with the society and the companies have been increased also. many proceedings of the international conference on industrial engineering and operations management sao paulo, brazil, april 5 - 8, 2021 © ieom society international 938",,,"ricardo alexandre diogo and eduardo de freitas rocha loures polytechnic school pontifical catholic university of parana curitiba, parana, brazil r.diogo@pucpr.br, eduardo.loures@pucpr.br neri dos santos graduate program in knowledge engineering and management federal university of santa catarina florianopolis, santa catarina, brazil nerisantos@gmail.com",
97,Construction Of A Parkinson´S Voice Database,"in recent years, voice analysis has been studied for the non-invasive evaluation of parkinson patients. in this context, a parkinson´s voice database has been built by an interdisciplinary team made up of neurologists, otorhinolaryngologists and speech therapists from hospital posadas and hospital rivadavia and coordinated by researchers from universidad nacional de la matanza (unlam). voice samples were recorded during 2019 at a sound laboratory in hospital rivadavia which had been equipped by unlam and conditioned by a sound technician and a speech therapist. parkinson patients were selected and scheduled to participate in a circuit that included a neurological assessment with the unified parkinson's disease rating scale (updrs), voice recordings and a vocal cord endoscopy. such investigation was approved and supervised by hospital rivadavia ethics´ committee ethics. the voice database includes voice simples of 55 (24 female and 31 male) parkinson patients. in addition, voice samples from 64 non- parkinson participants were obtained under the same conditions and protocol. preliminary results from the database show differentiation between parkinson and non- parkinson participants, though parameters and methods to synthetize differences are still pending. parkinson patients´ age range between 38 and 79 years (mean age: 64), and disease duration varies from 1 to 16 years (mean: 6 years). general results in terms of vocal cords condition and hoarseness are remarkable when compared with healthy participants. the collaborative work from this interdisciplinary group will provide a useful, easy to use, low-cost tool for parkinson patients´ follow-up. proceedings of the international conference on industrial engineering and operations management sao paulo, brazil, april 5 - 8, 2021 © ieom society international 940",,,"monica giuliano, silvia noemí perez, evangelina maldonado, pablo bondar, daniela linari national university of la matanza, buenos aires, argentina mgiuliano@unlam.edu.ar, sperez@unlam.edu.ar dario adamec hospital posadas- hospital rivadavia argentina darioadamec@yahoo.com.ar maría inés debas, carlos morales, leticia de león, aldo yaco, joice birelli, macarena martínez ribaya, maría lis lacaze hospital rivadavia, servicio de orl y fonoaudiología ciudad de buenos aires, argentina mariainesdebas@gmail.com jorge a. gurlekian laboratorio de investigaciones sensoriales-inigem-conicet-uba ciudad de buenos aires, argentina anagraf99@hotmail.com",
98,An Exploratory Research On Startup Firms Operating In  Turkey,"with their flexible structures that can easily adapt to change, start-up companies have become the cornerstone of the entrepreneurial ecosystem in today's economy. in the economic competition between countries, start-up companies in the country are of great importance. when the related literature’s examined, it’s seen that turkey has not been investigated in a satisfactory form in terms of the condition on start-up firms. given the worldwide prevalence and importance of these firms, such research is considered essential for turkey. the aim of this study is to present exploratory knowledge on start-up firms which has been established and operating in turkey. hence, 5504 start-up companies in turkey are examined in terms of variables such as the sector in which they operate, investment types, and the demographics of investors. as a result of the study, as a result of the research, it was found that startup investors are mostly graduated from foreign universities, the number of male investors is higher than female investors, the number of startups has increased in the 2000s, there is a concentration of startups in the e-commerce and manufacturing sector, most of the startups continue to operate and majority of investment types are seed. the study is thought to be beneficial for all stakeholders from researchers to practitioners.","entrepreneur, investment, sector","This study is intended to provide information on Turkey's startup ecosystem. In this context, the dataset consisting of 5,504 startups established from 1984 to 2019 is examined. The purpose of the study is to obtain information that will provide a descriptive point of view on Turkey’s startup ecosystem. In this regard, the questions guiding the research are designed to clarify the nature and properties of startups and their investors who make up the ecosystem of Turkey. When the universities which startup investors graduated from are examined within the scope of the research, it is seen that most of the investors received education abroad. It is possible to think about the adequacy of higher education in Turkey on promoting and encouraging startup investment according to this result. On the other hand, the majority of startup investors who had higher education in Turkey got their degrees from public universities. It’s seen that the administrations of private universities need to think about their curriculum on catching the economic trends of era. Considering the compatibility of this new business model with the economic requirements of the age, it can be said that the Turkish higher education system should work harder to compete with its rivals. When examining participation in economic life in Turkey, it is a known fact that no inequality between the genders. It is seen that men are more involved in economic life than women. When the distribution of startup investors by gender is examined within the scope of the research, a suitable result is found for this situation. According to the results, the number of male investors is more than twice the number of female investors. Nowadays, it is very important for women to take part in working life as much as men. It would be useful for economic systems that encourage startup investments to consider creating conditions in favor of women. Having more women investors in the startup world will create an advantage for the economy and provide different perspectives in the sectors. Considering the number of startups established by years, it is striking that there has been a remarkable increase since the end of the ‘90s. Since 2005, there has been a steady increase in the number of startup companies established. As of 2010, it is seen that there has been a significant increase in the number of startups established. The stability in the number of startups established is promising considering the global and national economic crises experienced. As a matter of fact, these flexible and agile structures, which can adapt to variable conditions, make economies more resistant to crises. In the new economic order of the world, it is thought that countries with more startups will be more advantageous in competition. Considering the distribution of startup companies by sectors, the distribution is not very homogeneous. It is observed that there is a concentration in manufacturing, technology, trade and e-commerce sectors. This is not surprising, mainly given the nature of economy and human needs. However, it would be advantageous to become widespread with this innovative business model in different sectors.

100,The Determinants Of A Culture Of Quality For  Bolivian Firms,"philip crosby famously said that “quality is the result of a carefully constructed cultural environment. it has to be the fabric of the organization, not part of the fabric.” this quote suggests that quality must find new approaches for their study that go beyond traditional conceptualizations, such as the study of the culture of quality. worldwide, there are a series of studies about the culture of quality. however, in bolivia and south america, no studies have analyzed their determinants. thus, our research surveyed 185 bolivian managers and through the use of statistical modeling, we found that customer focus, quality vision, and quality values positively influence the culture of quality. additionally, we developed a culture of quality index to rank the surveyed firms according to their score. we found that: (a) large firms; (b) firms that implemented quality standards; and (c) product manufacturing firms have the highest culture of quality scores. in contrast, (i) sme’s; (ii) firms that did not implement quality standards; and (iii) service firms showed the lowest culture of quality scores. finally, we discuss the implications and strategies for bolivian firms.","quality, culture of quality, customer focus, quality vision, quality values",,"boris christian herbas torrico and jarin canaza fernandez exact sciences and engineering research center (cicei) bolivian catholic university cochabamba, bolivia bherbas@ucb.edu.bo, jarincanaza@gmail.com","References

107,Optimization Of The Shaft Machining Process Using 2K  Factorial Design,"optimizing a shaft machining process is critical to reaching the quality requirements specified by the customer. thus, the study's objective is to define the appropriate parameters to optimize the axle machining process used in a didactic experiment in a laboratory of manufacturing processes in a public university. for this, an experimental project was carried out to reach the best fit to minimize the shaft shape error and improve the process quality. to develop this study, the experiment design is based on the 2k factorial design methodology and anova analysis. the findings show that the shape error is related to the interaction between feed rate, depth of cut and tool tip radius.",machining,"We sought to define the levels of shaft machining parameters that minimize the problem of shaft shape error. For this, we used a methodology of design of experiments, called factorial project 2k, specifically a factorial project 2³, and the ANOVA analysis. For this, we investigated three factors at two levels: feed rate (10 and 30 mm/min), depth of cut (30 and 50 μm), and tooltip radius (1 and 3 mm). We performed 16 trials (eight on each day), and we analyzed the combinations identified in the experimental matrix. Based on our data collection and analysis, we could identify the optimal fit of each factor level to minimize the shaft shape error. The finding showed that feed rate [mm/min]: 10 mm/min; depth of cut [µm]: 30 µm; tooltip radius [mm]: 3 mm. Therefore, by adopting the indicated levels, we could minimize the effect of the shaft shape error, ensuring better quality to the machining process performed by the manufacturing process laboratory of a public university. Also, it is interesting to emphasize that the use of Experimental projects facilitates the analysis process since the way information is collected mitigates possible bias that may arise in the practical day-to-day. Another relevant point is that through this optimization, the resources used for the teaching and learning process in engineering courses are improved, increasing the effectiveness of teaching.

109,The Implementation Of Mixture Design And Design Thinking  For The Development Of A Bolivian Native Plants Based,"innovation is the engine for economic development. the need for new products represents opportunities for countries with unique characteristics, such as bolivia. the country's location in south america combined with dramatic variations in topography and climate result in a range of ecosystems. as a consequence, there is a rich variety of underexplored resources, such as native plants. no studies have considered their use for the innovation of new products. therefore, we developed the formulation of a new liquor based on native plants from bolivia. for the development: (a) we made a literature review of bolivian native plants; (b) we optimized the liquor’s attributes through mixture design; (c) we used design thinking to understand consumers taste. the results suggest: (a) the combination of design thinking and mixture design allowed the successful development of a new liquor from 27 native plants; (b) the iterative nature of design thinking allowed the adaptation of liquor prototypes to consumer preferences; (c) market research found the prototype satisfied consumers. the development of this new liquor suggests that countries with rich and varied ecosystems offer new opportunities for innovative products. combination of mixture design and design thinking offers new opportunities for new product development in combinatorial complexity.","design thinking, native plants","and inferences about consumer behavior. However, the minimum sample size used for the survey suggests that the results are generalizable to a larger population. We neglected a sizeable sample approach due to the prioritization of formulation under combinatorial complexity. Although DT does not require expensive testing, the container's shape and material labels were underexplored characteristics. Future studies could seek to reproduce our study with better equipment and more controlled conditions. Moreover, future research should try more precise colorimetric measurements. In our study, due to economic constraints, we adopted a cheaper measurement technique. However, according to the literature, our method should not greatly differ from more complex measurement methodologies. Finally, future studies should investigate the chemical characterization of the final product bioactive profile. They should consider stability features, storage conditions, and preservation. Changes in physical properties are related to the secondary metabolites’ decomposition by enzymes and parameter changes should be controlled. Future studies should assess color, taste, odor, specific gravity, solid residue, viscosity, microbial content, chromatographic, and spectral characteristics of our final product. As our combined methodology and successful new product development have shown: “Innovation is taking two things that exist and putting them together in a new way” (Tom Freston, Co-founder of MTV).","liquor boris christian herbas torrico and rené cabero villazón exact sciences and engineering research center (cicei) bolivian catholic university cochabamba, bolivia bherbas@ucb.edu.bo, rene.cabero@ucb.edu.bo",
110,The Role Of Flexibility In Enhancing Operational  Performance Through Sustainability Practices: A Case,"flexibility and sustainability are two philosophies that the original equipment manufacturers (oems) invested heavily in since the 21st century. this study identified the lack of empirical research investigating the relationship between flexibility and sustainability and their combined interactions with operational performance metrics. very few studies investigated this relationship in limited depth and breadth. therefore, this study aims to investigate the interaction between flexibility, sustainability, and their impact on operational performance in the united states (us) and european (eu) oems. based on the contingency theory and resource-based view theory, a conceptual model linking flexibility, sustainability, and operational performance was developed and empirically tested. after reviewing previous literature and consulting academicians and practitioners experienced in the topic, a survey was developed. the survey was conducted with a total of 140 respondents. the respondents are managers at oems facilities in europe and the us. the results indicated a significant and positive relationship between flexibility and operational performance, flexibility and sustainability, and sustainability and operational performance. the results also revealed that sustainability mediates the relationship between flexibility and operational performance. this study can help managers know what flexibility and sustainability practices optimize operational performance.","flexibility, sustainability, manufacturing",,"study on the us and european original equipment manufacturers mohamad ali mezher* and raed el-khalil information technology and operations management department lebanese american university beirut, lebanon mohammadali.mezher@lau.edu, raed.elkhalil@lau.edu.lb",
111,Process Reliability Improvement Of Slitting Machines In An Industrial Setting,"this paper aims to demonstrate an effective approach for improving process reliability within a flexible packaging manufacturing organization. as the need for efficient industrial processes grows globally, industries tend to seek robust methodologies to chart their path to business excellence in terms of quality products and services. this research is focused on dmaic methodology for investigating the root causes of slitting machines, and to proffer the best solution to improve the process. a data collection plan which is based on the lowest-performing machines was obtained, followed by qualitative and quantitative process analysis to identify the potential cause(s) for the machines' low process reliability. statistical tools were used to validate the potential factors that are most probably critical for the machine's performance. the analysis indicates that actual operating slitting speed was below standard speed due to the possibility of defective slit rolls, and the presence of flags on jumbo rolls that accounted for 20% – 40% of the gross downtime. employee’s inability to capture downtime was also identified as one of the critical factors affecting the performance of slitting machines. after implementing solutions, a 25% improvement in the process reliability was achieved without compromising the quality of the products.","six sigma, dmaic, slitting machines","This research presented a successful case study of PR improvements of slitting process in flexible packaging manufacturing by using the SS-DMAIC problem-solving methodologies. After the investigation carried out in the analysis and improvement phases, the improvement project presented in this paper found that the machine speed, inaccurate downtime capturing, wastage regenerated, and interaction between the films and machine had a statistically significant impact on the PR of the slitting process. By considering these factors for improvement, the PR increased by 25%from a baseline of 28% to 35%, which exceeds the best historical performance of the machines. This project demonstrates the successful application of SS-DMAIC to industrial challenges, therefore, organizations that continue to embrace Six Sigma's continuous improvement culture increase their product quality, achieve customer satisfaction and reduce waste.

It contributes to the project-based leaning area as it reflected in the postgraduate students’ enrollment and participation in the unit project concerned with ENN570 ERP. Here, this study explores the followings (1) what are the relevant skills for engineering students that can be enhanced to further pursue the career path? (2) What are the improvements/suggestions can be done on BN87 and the relevant positive experiences. To answer these questions, authors developed the questionnaire including two sections. It is recognized that redevelopment of the course can foster and enhance teaching and learning as it adopts the interactive and deep learning by students which can affect their academic achievements and performance. The qualitative analysis based on the introduced themes show that the master course is well prepared and organized in better manner, however, still some suggestion and recommendations are raised by the respondents towards improving the unit and the course at all. Focusing on the real learning is among the priorities in QUT. This encourages staff members and students together to be engaged in the learning and teaching process and focusing on the new techniques for curriculum redesign that matches with the international standards and intended learning outcomes. The implications of this paper come as a result of introducing the research project to the students and trying to upgrade their practical skills and knowledge in relevant field. These projects are based on real life problems and adopting the technologies to find an appropriate technique for solving the potential problems. A real implication here is considering this case study conducted in the developed nation of Australia and within one of the top ranked university, QUT. The designed questionnaire has a clear impact as it is directed to postgraduate engineering students from different countries and this could be treated as one of the advantages for this study. This means that views, criticism and suggestions for improvement are treated from several key persons specialized in the different engineering sciences and practices. 5.1 Limitations and future research Similar to other studies in the field, this paper has limitations such that this study is qualitative designed. Further, it is conducted focusing on only one university and one unit and course designed. Other researchers can utilize the developed questionnaire and adopt to other units/courses so that improvement and redevelopment can be established. Future research can be established while doing empirical investigation on the assessment processes aligned for the unit introduced.

121,"Milk Collection Optimization In Atlántico, Colombia.","the world's consumption of milk has been growing since the '80s. the food and agriculture organization of united nations (fao) predicts a growth rate of milk production of 2.5% per year for 2020-2030. furthermore, it estimates that per capita consumption in developing countries (such as colombia) will increase at twice the rate of production in this period. in the dairy sector of atlántico (a northern state of colombia), inefficiency in the logistics process in milk collection was identified due to the lack of efficient operating models and the atomization of producers (long distances), among other causes. moreover, in colombia, the milk collection costs represent 33% of the logistics costs, being above the average in the dairy sector worldwide, that reduces productivity and competitiveness to the sector. the milk collection process, at strategic-tactical level can be tackled as a districting problem with a two-phase approach ""group first - route later"" as an alternative to the classic vehicle routing problem. this has motivated the current work to solve the milk collection at strategic-tactical level in atlántico, through a districting design strategy to minimize the distances to be covered in a subsequent routing while consolidating the farms into districts and optimizing the composition of the fleet. a districting strategy prior to the routing process improves efficiency in collection and distribution processes. in the present work, we propose a multi-objective optimization model with the location-allocation approach, in which once the collection centers are located, the allocation of farms to them is balanced, within a logistic districting context. we combine the milk collection and districting context, to address two objectives that impact the efficiency of the milk collection process, namely: (i) minimize the dispersion measured as the sum of the distances to travel between farms and their assigned collection center, (ii) minimize the cost of the facilities and the vehicle fleet. in addition, we consider some districting and milk collection criteria, constraints, and characteristics to get compact districts considering a limit of distance between the farms and their collection center (center of the district), get balanced districts in relation to the daily milk supply considering capacity constraints of collection centers and vehicles fleet, no load division and heterogeneous fleet. we expect an improvement in terms of costs due to shorter travel distances and better use of the fleet.","optimization, milk collection, districting",,"ronald a. corcho, juan g. villegas and pablo maya department of industrial engineering universidad de antioquia medellín, antioquia, colombia ronald.corcho@udea.edu.co, juan.villegas@udea.edu.co, pablo.maya@udea.edu.co",
122,Strategic Management To Model Profitability Of The Primary  Dairy Sector In Colombia,"in colombia, the annual production of milk was 7,301 million liters in 2019. the dairy sector accounts for 1.6 percent of national gdp (gross domestic product) and 21.8 percent of agricultural gdp. however, the results for this sector have not been satisfactory as expected in the last decades as compared to the rest of latin america. as we were able to identify, many problems have been reported in the primary productive sector such as: lack of policies to improve productivity, inefficiency in production, inadequate technical production processes, huge variability in production prices, competitive disadvantages generated by the massive inflow of imported goods, among others, which contributes greatly to the reductions on dairy farms profitability. the latter implies the need for research on decision- making tools that reduce uncertainty in the dairy industry. the use of technical indexes aimed to control in evaluate dairy farms in terms of productivity and profitability, which can be useful to monitor and track changes and requirements for the colombian dairy industry. in colombia, there are no studies addressed at the determinants of profitability of the dairy sector. this has motivated the current work to study profitability using predictive analytics, through an integrated approach considering costs, productivity, economic and technical indexes. this project proposes a management model that supports decision-making on dairy farms by calculating profitability and generating alerts based on the sensibility of selected input variables. the model focuses on the determination of the cause-effect relationships between the input and output variables (net annual income, profit margin, and return rates on the invested capital) to explain the determinant of profitability in the farm. first, we described the generalities of the primary link in the dairy sector in colombia. second, using a panel of experts we selected a set of variables related to feed, animals, human resources, fertilization, among others. we used principal component analysis (pca) as a tool to reduce preselected inputs to those that explain better the variance and have the greatest impact on output variables. the results of this pca worked as an initial model for multiple linear regression models as the primary methodology for establishing cause-effect relationships between input and output variables (a model for each output variable) that can explain the profitability of the production in the farm. we used r studio to operate both methodologies. our final goal is to calculate the profitability considering our output variables. furthermore, generate alerts on input variables based on scenario analysis to support decision-making in dairy farms. our work team had access to an experimental farm of the center of agricultural practices and development of the universidad de antioquia located in the municipality of san pedro de los milagros, antioquia, where we used productive records of this farm, developing indexes and generating new determinants of profitability if these were not available. we propose to validate this model on farms in other regions in colombia in order to verify the capacity to calculate profitability in real management situations in the colombian dairy productive sector.","competitiveness, dairy, productivity, profitability",,"alejandra berdugo, gloria ramírez and carmen patiño department of industrial engineering universidad de antioquia medellín, antioquia, colombia alejandra.berdugoa@udea.edu.co, glorial.ramirez@udea.edu.co, elena.patino@udea.edu.co josé guarín department of agricultural sciences universidad de antioquia medellín, antioquia, colombia fernando.guarin@udea.edu.co",

124,"Iiot Architecture Using Lora Technology, Lorawan  And Opc Ua Protocols","this paper presents the integration of a wireless long-range sensor network (lora), using the lorawan protocol, to an opc tcp network with opc ua standard. this proposal allows the creation of cyber-physical spaces where all the elements can communicate in a safe, adaptable, and scalable way offering an iiot (industrial internet of things) solution - useful for industry 4.0. due to the specificities of each protocol (lora, lorawan and opc ua), developments in hardware, firmware, and software are presented for the purpose to obtain an integrated solution capable of providing data from a lorawan network directly to an hmi, using the opc ua standard. the work also presents details of the embedded electronic system, developed for the lora sensor nodes, including the specification of the components used and signal conditioning circuits required. furthermore, this work also presents the implementation stages of the lorawan - opc ua gateway, based on the open-source operational system, openwrt, one of the main components necessary for the proposed integration working. suggestions for programming the opc ua server, embedded in the openwrt os, are detailed. tests of the developed lora sensor nodes, as well as the integration with a scada operator interface are presented, demonstrating that the proposal integration is feasible and can be applied to increase i/o points monitored by an operator, without the need for intervention in the installed automation system.","iot, opc ua, lorawan","This work sought to address all the necessary steps to demonstrate the feasibility of integrating the LoRaWAN and OPC UA protocols embedded in a network device to then be used as another communication option for industrial environments, within the context of Industry 4.0 and IIoT technologies. The results obtained in the tests of the LoRaWAN network demonstrate the promising characteristics of the protocol in terms of range, cost and ease of implementation. The results obtained in the range test show that the technology can be used in large industrial parks where the diversified structure of tanks, pipes and concrete buildings do not represent major impediments to signal collection. By using appropriate antennas, in addition to ensuring the correct location of the gateway nodes and sensors, it is possible to eliminate several obstacles to the signal, thus contributing to the creation of a cyber-physical space. With regard to OPC UA, the present work demonstrated one of its main characteristics, i.e. the independence of platforms, through the compilation and execution of an OPC UA server embedded on the same hardware of the LoRAWAN gateway, contributing to the reduction of costs in infrastructure. Software licensing is free due to the choice of Open62541 open source libraries and the OpenWRT system, also open source and present in several network infrastructure devices, constantly being developed by the developer community. The LoRaWAN and OPC UA protocols worked properly and efficiently, implemented separately. The integration between both also took place successfully and, in order to demonstrate the feasibility of the integration, temperature measurements were carried out, which is a quantity common to the industrial environment, focusing on the representation of these data in a SCADA interface that includes the software for supervision and operation in use for decades across the industry. Presenting this data at the SCADA level reliably validates the proposed integration.","angelo guimarães silva federal university of minas gerais 6627 ave. antônio carlos, belo horizonte, mg 31270–901, brazil angeloguimas@ufmg.br hugo césar coelho michel electronic engineering department federal university of minas gerais 6627 ave. antônio carlos, belo horizonte, mg 31270–901, brazil hugomichel@ufmg.br",
125,A Mathematical Model For Patient Scheduling In  Radiotherapy Treatment,"scheduling radiotherapy treatments for cancer patients is a major concern for hospitals and patients. the delay in radiotherapy has a negative effect on the patient and flow of patients in hospitals. this research proposes a mathematical model for multi-period radiotherapy planning and scheduling problems with capacity constraints over a particular time horizon. the goal is to schedule a list of 3d curative patients who must undergo radiotherapy. the problem is formulated with a multi-objective model with two objectives and two stages: minimize the makespan and priority score in the first stage and minimize and the sum of the finish time and the sum of different balance workloads in the second stage. computational experiments are executed using the simulated data according to real treatments of 3d curative patients. the results show that the model satisfies all constraints with the right assignment and operation sequence. thus, the proposed mathematical model can assist in the decision-making process for cancer patient scheduling for radiotherapy treatment. this helps reduce the time for planning and scheduling in the radiotherapy department.","patient scheduling, mathematical model, waiting time, brazil","The multi-period radiotherapy planning and scheduling problem with capacity constraint over a particular time horizon. increase scheduling performance such as patient waiting time, scheduling time during the procedures. The problem is formulated with a multi-objective model with two objectives, and two stages are considered in the proposed model: minimization of makespan and priority score in first and minimize the sum of the finish time and sum of difference balance workload. Then, an instance inspired by the real process of 3D curative patients planning. The results show that the model satisfies all constraints with the right assignment and operation sequence. The proposed mathematical model is able to assist in the decision-making process for cancer patient scheduling for radiotherapy treatment. This helps reduce the time for planning and scheduling in the radiotherapy department. Thus, the average patient waiting time is decreased. Nevertheless, the radiotherapy planning and scheduling problem is usually discussed under the assumption that the parameter and capacity are deterministic variables. In practice, some of these assumptions are unrealistic. In the future, research should focus on a dynamic model for handling uncertainty in real-world practice.

126,A Case Study Of Inventory Management System For An  International Lifestyle Product Retailer In Bolivia,"effective inventory management influences every aspect of a firm’s operations. inventory management in developing countries is a difficult business process because firms do not use basic inventory control concepts and techniques. moreover, developing countries are characterized by trade imbalances with developed countries due to process inefficiencies, bureaucracy, and communication problems. this leads to longer lead times and supply uncertainty. consequently, firms attempt to overcome the supply uncertainty by carrying unnecessary amounts of buffer stocks. we analyzed the inventory management system of an international lifestyle product retailer in bolivia and found that, as the literature predicted, the firm showed no use of basic inventory control techniques. particularly, it did not make data-driven decisions, lacked an effective inventory management system, or knew which products had higher consumer demand, and thus worked under a high level of supply uncertainty and inventory management illiteracy. therefore, to reduce supply uncertainty, we developed a new inventory management system based on two strategies: (a) strategies to reduce demand uncertainty; and (b) strategies to reduce process uncertainty. specifically, we implemented triple exponential smoothing for product demand forecasting, abc segmentation to identify the most important products in the firm’s portfolio, the newsvendor model to determine optimal inventory levels, powers-of- two policies, to optimize reorder times, and turnover based metrics to arrange skus in the warehouse. overall, our results suggest the significance of taking into account the country in which any firm operates. hence, it should not be a surprise that in developing countries firms show high buffer stocks and generally adopt reactive flexibility practices.","demand forecasting, abc segmentation, newsvendor model",,"boris christian herbas torrico and sebastian alem oyola exact sciences and engineering research center (cicei) bolivian catholic university cochabamba, bolivia bherbas@ucb.edu.bo, sebas.alem96@gmail.com","References

Increasing product reliability can be done through increasing the reliability of its components for products sold under warranty. This method can reduce warranty costs. The reliability improvement that is carried out can reduce the amount of damage during the warranty period, thereby reducing warranty costs. Reliability improvements made to product components can improve overall product reliability. Claims that arise due to product damage can have a detrimental impact on the consumer, so we must consider the interests of the consumer. Increased product durability and premium materials are the key to product quality. In this study, brand image significantly affects consumer satisfaction. Efforts to increase brand image need to be carried out as follows: promotion, maintaining and enhancing reputation, especially """" the big brand """". Companies must also develop sustainable technology and product innovation. Every technological advancement used by the company must always be reported as good news to all people. Furthermore, companies must be able to prevent consumers from being disappointed in products and services. Therefore, product quality and brand image affect consumer satisfaction very significantly.

With regard to the company must be able to meet the expectations and satisfaction of consumers, so explore consumer desires in the form of product durability, trends, and innovation. Furthermore, the company must be able to provide products that are superior to products of its competitors. Research on the advantages and disadvantages of products compared to competitors' products so that companies can improve their products. Brand image significantly affects buying decision. Efforts to increase brand image need to be carried out as follows: promotion, maintaining and enhancing reputation, especially ""the big brand"". Company must also develop sustainable technology and product innovation. Every technological advancement used by the company must always be reported as good news to all people. Furthermore, companies must be able to prevent consumers from being disappointed in products and services. Consideration of the Country of origin is one of the keys that consumers make purchasing decisions. A government that focuses on innovation and science and the country itself always maintains a good reputation will have a certain image advantage by society. A country known for its manufacturing industry will have certain advantages. The status of a country that produces products as a developed country has certain advantages. So, all economic decisions on the view of companies and countries are the focus of science and technology and innovation. From the results of research and discussion, it can be understood that the experiences of multinational companies provide valuable lessons, especially for domestic entrepreneurs.

137,Determining The Most Habitable Planet Using Multi-Criteria  Decision Making Techniques,"every planet in the universe has its own characteristics. these features make the planets different among themselves. for this reason, all the different properties of the planets must be evaluated at the same time in determining habitable planets. this situation requires a multi-criteria decision making (mcdm) approach. in this study, a list of habitable planets (nine planets and the moon) has been considered. seventeen different criteria such as mass, gravity, diameter, density, escape velocity, rotation time, day of length, distance from sun, perihelion, aphelion, orbital period, orbital velocity, orbital inclination, orbital eccentricity, obliquity to orbit, mean temperature and number of satellites are taken into account. the weights of criteria are determined with dematel (the decision making trial and evaluation laboratory) by analyzing the interactions among criteria. orbital inclination is the criterion with the highest weight and the criterion with the lowest weight is the number of satellites. after weighting the criteria with dematel, vikor (visekriterijumska optimizacija i kompromisno resenje) and topsis (technique for order preference to similarity to ideal solution) approaches are used to rank the planets. according to the topsis, earth is ranked first, venus ranked second and mercury ranked third in the order of the most habitable planets. according to the vikor method, earth is ranked first, mars ranked second and mercury ranked third in the order of the most habitable planets. finally, the same calculations are done considering with equal weights and the results are discussed.","habitable planets, dematel, topsis","In this study, TOPSIS and VIKOR methods were used to evaluate habitable planets and the results were compared. DEMATEL method was used to determine the criterion weights. According to the DEMATEL-TOPSIS methods, Earth ranked first, Venus ranked second and Mercury ranked third in the ranking of the most habitable planets. With the DEMATEL-VIKOR method, Earth ranked first, Mars ranked second, and Mercury ranked third in the list of habitable planets. TOPSIS and VIKOR methods were also applied by taking the criterion weights equal. According to the TOPSIS method, Earth is in the first place, Venus is in the second and Mercury is in the third place. Since the first and second conditions could not be met in the VIKOR method with equal criteria weights, the best alternative could not be determined. After this study, MCDM methods can be used to analyze nutrients that can be grown on planets. These methods can also be applied in the selection of astronauts with different characteristics to be sent to space.","gizem gunaydin, gamze duvan and eren ozceylan industrial engineering department gaziantep university gaziantep 27100, turkey gizem.gunaydin44@gmail.com, gamzeduvann@gmail.com, erenozceylan@gmail.com",
138,Total Specific Allocation Grant For Population Development  And Population Growth In Indonesia,"national family planning program and other development programs have contributed to the decline of fertility and mortality levels and in turn population growth in indonesia (samosir 1992; haub 1989). under the new order regime, in indonesia, family planning program was initiated and supported centrally by the government. however, in the reformed era, family planning program is decentralized to the district government. central government still provides districts with specific allocation grant (dana alokasi khusus/dak) to support population development including family planning program. this study aims to examine the association between specific allocation grant for population development and population growth rate in indonesia. the data used came from indodapoer of the world bank in 2009 covering 372 districts in indonesia. the dependent variable in this study was the population growth rate during 2010–2015. the independent variables were the total dak for population development, net enrollment ratio (ner) of primary school, and household expenditure for the poorest 20 percent. the data was analyzed using a multiple linear regression. the results of the study show that lower population growth rate was associated with larger dak for population development, higher ner of primary school, and lower household expenditure for the poorest 20 percent.","population growth, district","The results of this study confirm the importance of Total Specific Allocation Grant (DAK) for population development in reducing population growth rate even after controlling for the effects of education achievement and poverty. It means that the availability of DAK for population development is a smart strategy to manage population growth rate in districts in Indonesia so that the regional government can promote the improvement of human welfare in their districts. The availability of DAK for population development can be used to enhance access to even and affordable quality family planning services and information in districts so that fertility and mortality level and hence population growth rate can also be managed. The significant effect of education achievement and poverty also imply that in order to manage population growth rate, universal primary education and the elimination of poverty should be attained. Access to education can lead to the postponement of age at first marriage and birth and increase woman’s participation in the labor force and then decline of number of children and lower population growth rate. Meanwhile, lower poverty suggests higher aspiration toward the smaller quantity of children and higher quality of children and hence lower fertility and population growth rate.","omas bulan samosir department of economics, faculty of economic and business universitas indonesia jakarta, indonesia omas.bulan@ui.ac.id, omasbr@yahoo.co.uk","references in Indonesia, in: Family Demography in Asia: A Comparative Analysis of Fertility Preferences, 2018.

139,Assessing Disruptive Crises Of Supply Chain In  Firms Amidst Covid-19: An Application Of Multi,"supply chains are encountering more uncertain conditions and risks. disruptions that impede the flow of material through a supply chain that can also result in failure to deliver end goods are a significant category of risks. the consequence of the covid-19 outbreak has led to shut down production in the supply chain system, resulting in significant impediments for many foreign supply-dependent enterprises. the constraints cause substantial disruptions of the supply chain, production delays, and supplier delays. in recent years, managing supply chain risks has been given more importance to protect supply chains from interruptions by forecasts and prevention. the effects of disruptions on logistics, costs, demand, profits, and inventory levels of the supply chain are analyzed. svm is one of the most convenient and effective supervised learning algorithms commonly used for classification and regression challenges. this paper presents a modernistic machine learning model, multi- category support vector machines (mc-svm) algorithm through training on selected samples. in order to abet mc-svm model to perform well on imbalanced data, k-means clustering algorithm has been proposed to classify clusters of nodes at-disruption, which share similar interruption profiles and can find the relationships between the data object, provide massive information and contribute significantly to accelerating classification and prediction of the svm model. data from portfolios of different firms in pharmaceutical industry has been used to train the mc-svm model which maps the economic performance of a firm to a certain type of supply chain disruption (scd). the potentiality of this research will privilege better management of the supply chain and thus will permit a network to approach faster response times to the customer, lower costs in all respects of the chain and to the end customer terrific levels of stretch-ability, lower inventories throughout the chain, and diminished the bottleneck effect in the supply chain logistics.","multi category svm, k-means clustering","and Future Research Covid-19 has caused a disruptive crisis in the supply chain which is why it is important to identify the types of disruption. In this paper, we used an MC-SVM and k-means clustering approach to recognize a particular type of disruption a firm is facing. To train the model, data collected from firms that faced critical disruptions were matched to a certain type of disruption matching their portfolios. Focusing on particular type disruption data was divided into 4 cluster types categorizing similar types as one. Then they were divided into multiclass by using the SVM model. Test datasets were used to find out the accuracy, random datasets caused varying accuracy. In this paper, we recognized the particular disruption a firm is facing. Identifying disruption type helps to focus on a certain aspect of the supply chain rather than the overall supply chain. This can help a firm to focus on decision making, to accurate corrective measure on certain criteria & necessary steps can be taken accordingly, also a known disruption type will help to respond quickly to take precaution & improve the certain aspect which needs Figure 3: Values of CSL for 100 samples from all four categories Figure 4: Values of Std for 100 samples from all four categories Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management Sao Paulo, Brazil, April 5 - 8, 2021","category-svm using k-means clustering md ariful islam, shubho roy, nishat farzana supriti and naimur rahman chowdhury department of mechanical & production engineering ahsanullah university of science & technology dhaka, bangladesh. shaikatsameeh44@gmail.com, shubhoroy529@gmail.com, nishat.supriti@gmail.com , naimur20rahman.mpe@aust.edu","References

141,Assessing Performance And Improving Productivity  Through Identification Of Sewing Defects: A Multi,"the apparel industry of bangladesh has been the leading export division and the preeminent source of foreign exchange. however, these industries are still confronting obstacles such as insufficient productivity, poor quality, higher defects rate which is reducing its output to a significant extent. minimization of defects by identifying the causes in various sections of these industries can significantly improve its productivity. this study emphasizes on identifying the root causes of sewing defects in an apparel firm and proposed auspicious corrective actions to reduce these defects. this study is carried out at fakir apparels limited to minimize the defects rate in its sewing section. pareto analysis has been performed to identify the most significant one among all the defects in two production lines and root causes of these defects have been analyzed by the cause-effect diagram. moreover, a plan-do-check-act (pdca) cycle has been designed to establish the corrective actions based on the root cause analysis. finally, technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (topsis), a multi criteria decision making (mcdm) technique has been used to rank and recommend different managerial decisions based on their priority and impact. the outcome of this study may bring significant changes in the sewing section of the apparel firm in terms of productivity and effectiveness.","productivity, mcdm, topsis","and Future work Quality defects are considered a major concern not only in apparel manufacturing industries but also almost in every sector of industries where consumers endeavor it. For the apparel industry, quality is assessed in terms of quality and standard of fibers, fabric quality, designs, and the finished garments. However, these defects in the product usually lead to rework, scrap, reject, additional processing time, and customer dissatisfaction which is not beneficial for a growing industry. This study has investigated and analyzed the sewing defects in an apparel firm employing Total quality management (TQM) tools such as Pareto chart, cause-effect diagram, PDCA cycle, and a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) technique referred Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). The Pareto chart reveals that the major cumulative sewing defects such as raw edge (41.6%), broken/open stitch (32.8%), uncut loose thread (29.9%), wavy (22.5%) and skip stitch (22.5%). Employing a cause-effect diagram, the root causes of each sewing defect has been identified, and several corrective actions have been recommended to defeat those defects. Moreover, a Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle has been established to propose a continual improvement of these defects. For emphasizing more importance on proposed managerial decisions, a TOPSIS approach has been employed to systematize those decisions in order. This managerial preference will help management to implement effective decisions for minimizing sewing defects. This study has been conducted on a particular section of the apparel manufacturing firm, while it can be extended considering other areas of this industry. A quality assurance system can also be incorporated for trailing the improvement after implementing the proposed remedial actions. In terms of efficiency and effectiveness, the consequence of this study can help the sewing section to focus more on concerning areas that bring significant advances in the sewing section of the apparel business.","criteria based case study in an apparel firm in bangladesh sharmine akther liza department of mechanical and production engineering ahsanullah university of science and technology dhaka 1208, bangladesh sharmineliza491@gmail.com , liza.ipe@aust.edu naimur rahman chowdhury department of mechanical and production engineering ahsanullah university of science and technology dhaka 1208, bangladesh naimur2020rahman@gmail.com , naimur20rahman.mpe@aust.edu md rakib rayhan department of industrial and production engineering bangladesh university of engineering and technology dhaka 1000, bangladesh rakibrayhan612@gmail.com",

143,"The Effect Of Shift Work On Police Officers’ Stress, Sleep  Quality, And Cognitive Performance In Sharjah Police","police officers are first responders, therefore shift work in this sector is imperative in order to ensure 24/7 coverage. the demanding nature of the pressing work schedules may have physiological, psychological, or other mental impacts on the workforce. hence, it’s necessary to study the association between the shift work and stress, sleep quality, and cognitive performance within the workforce. data were obtained from 307 participants working in sharjah police. in this study, stress was assessed using 22 items from spielberger police stress survey, respondents indicated the level of perceived stress on a 5-point likert scale during a three months period. the sleep quality was assessed using pittsburgh sleep quality index (psqi) through a questionnaire that included 12 items, where respondents were required to indicate the hours of their daily sleep during the three months period and rate the extent to which a number of different factors affected their sleep on a 4-point likert scale. furthermore, cognitive performance was assessed using 10 items from cognitive functioning self-assessment scale (cfss) questionnaire, where respondents are required to rate different events’ frequencies on a 5-point likert scale. statistical analysis is conducted using spss where analysis of variance is utilized. results showed important correlations between shiftwork and sleep quality, while shiftwork impact on stress, and cognitive performance of the participants is found to be insignificant.","shift work, police stress, sleep quality","This study presented the relationship between shift work and stress, sleep quality, and cognitive performance among Sharjah Police officers. In the present study, the association of shift work and stress severity in the past three months was examined using Spielberger Police Stress Survey. As well as the association of shift work and sleep quality in the past three months using PSQI. Cognitive performance (in the past three months) and shift work association was also tested. Results have shown that shift work is only associated with poorer sleep quality among officers. It can be concluded that shift work has no effect on stress levels among Sharjah Police officers, while it cannot be concluded that there’s an association between shift status and cognitive performance. Further future research should be carried out to investigate why the influence of sleep poorer quality in the current studied sample - if taken as an independent factor – has no significant influence on both stress and cognitive performance as may usually be expected (Alhola and Polo-Kantola P. 2007, Bendak and Rashid 2020). An early explanation can be highlighted as the overall elevated positive organizational culture and technology-empowered work environment, which can help reduce work stresses and support better cognitive performance respectively. All three measured variables as well as shift work information were all obtained utilizing self-reporting method which involves a high risk of bias. Objective measures could be utilized to study stress, sleep quality, and cognitive performance along with the subjective self-reporting. Furthermore, a comparison between different shift rosters can be conducted in order to differentiate between the impact of each roster in order to help shift managers to set an optimum shift schedule that will increase productivity and reduce health risks. Moreover, further analysis of covariate such as gender, rank, and age might have an effect on the correlation between shift work and the other variables.","workforce. bushra almheiri and hamad rashid department of industrial engineering and engineering management university of sharjah sharjah, united arab emirates u18104305@sharjah.ac.ae, hamad.rashid@sharjah.ac.ae",
144,Recognizing Critical Drivers To Mitigate Supply  Chain Disruptions In Pharmaceutical Industry,"covid-19 pandemic has significantly interrupted the global production and supply chain operation in all aspects of the consumer market. along with other domains, the pharmaceutical industry has experienced its outbreaks on supply chain drivers impacting sustainable production and consumption patterns during the post-pandemic era. this motive stimulated the necessity for analyzing supply chain disruptions that severely affected logistics, procurement, production and distribution in the supply chain. elimination of these disruptions in the supply chain may depend on many critical drivers which can accelerate the implementation of sustainability thus enhancing the performance of the supply chain in the context of an impending environment. in order to improve the resilience and performance of the supply chain, this study identifies and addresses those critical drivers and characterizes them based on their percentage implemented by pareto analysis. furthermore, a grey based decision making trial and evaluation laboratory (dematel) model is proposed to establish the causal relationships among these critical drivers. the findings of this work will demonstrate the structure and interrelationships between drivers and identify the most critical drivers for a long term sustainability of supply chain to eliminate disruptions in the supply chain. the findings can pave a way to business managers, policymakers and other stakeholders in numerous industries to identify critical drivers in attaining undisrupted business environment in the pandemic context.","dematel, grey theory","COVID-19 has thrown a huge challenge to the decision makers to make major decisions in the disrupted supply chain environment. Sustainability and performance of supply chain in pharmaceutical firms are at stake. On the other hand, to battle the casualty of the pandemic, pharmaceutical firms are one of the most important sectors to perform their operations, distributions, logistics and inventory management more responsively to better cater their consumers. As a result, It has become a prime task for the decision makers to explore and prioritize the most critical supply chain drivers which if adopted and executed in the supply chain practice will facilitate the firms to better perform between stages, respond quickly changes and run the operations efficiently with all the strategy to withstand disruptions caused by COVID-19. The purpose of this study was mainly to help the supply chain decision makers by providing them insights about the impactful drivers in supply chain, there level of prominence and most importantly to show the interrelationships between these critical driver. This study may help them to recognize the cause-effect relationship between these drivers. Decision makers, from the insights, can differentiate the drivers that effect the other drivers and prioritize them accordingly while implementing. We used a grey-based DEMATEL approach to establish the interrelationships between the drivers. However, there are inevitable limitations in this research which can be addressed in the future works. While developing the relationships, only ten drivers were considered to explore which might not always be enough for the decision makers if there is a heavily damaged business scenario in a firm. Opinions and recommendations from more experts could result in a more comprehensive findings from the research. Data and information from more studies could allow a broader generalization of the outputs. Using DEMATEL method might not ensure a consistent comparison between pairs. Other fuzzy techniques could have been incorporated in the model. Drivers can be assessed with relative weight and prioritization. Apart from these limitations, this hybrid approach of grey based DEMATEL model handles the complexity of the problem and effectively evaluated the interdependencies between the drivers which will be beneficial for supply chain decision makers to fight COVID-19.","during covid-19 naimur rahman chowdhury, sharmine akther liza, syed tanvir, abu saimon raj and pritom mohajon department of mechanical & production engineering ahsanullah university of science & technology dhaka, bangladesh. naimur20rahman.mpe@aust.edu, liza.ipe@aust.edu, syedtanvirjisan@gmail.com, saimon.sheikh107@gmail.com , pritommohajan291@gmail.com",

ECC is a business model that is developed in Satc's pre- incubator - the Cocreation Lab. The new course matrices, therefore, will present the PFC - Final Course Project, instead of the TCC. Enrolling in the PFC, the student has two options - TCC or ECC. 6. Conclusion we innovate because we prioritize quality education for the citizens and professionals we train. PEC is yet another initiative to connect students, the internal and external communities and the region's innovation ecosystem to the future. Encourage the development of soft skills, such as leadership, and promote the search for new solutions for the market. Since it was implemented, the PEC has made it possible to implement new institutional projects such as the Cocreation Lab, Colearning and HUB Satc. In addition, it has been an important training and networking tool for startups. The project followed three pillars: the awakening of new ideas, the attraction of these businesses and the consolidation. Everyone involved in the consolidation of the PEC believes that entrepreneurial education is of paramount importance for the future of the actors we impact (students, employees, incubators, the external community, the local innovation ecosystem, among others). To exemplify the quality of the work that Satc has been doing, the words of the coordinator of ACATE Educação Felipe Mandawalli finalize this report. “Satc's evolution since the beginning of the program is visible.

152,Portfolio Management Of Social Projects: A Case Study In  Ifsp,"portfolio management is a technique to manage several individual projects with similar goals at the same time. social projects with non-governmental organizations (ngos) are very common, however ngos do not normally possess the knowledge or the manpower to take in new projects. when social projects are undertaken, the management of scarce resources and knowledge is fundamental to achieve each individual project goal. through a literature review and search for the best selection method to incorporate projects in the portfolio this work will demonstrate a case study performed by a scholarship student of ifsp in the selection, execution and control & monitor phases of a portfolio that was undertaken in the 2020 school year. the work was able to answer the research questions and improve overall individual project performance, increasing the institutions body of knowledge and lessons learned, even in a year with many uncertainties due to the covid-19 restrictions.","project management, new strategies","Portfolio management is a complex task to be undertaken, with several problems affecting the success of the projects. To achieve success the project management plan must be aligned with realistic achievements and goals. Also, the metrics between what was proposed and what was delivered is important to remove speculative results. To achieve this the actions were taken to comply with the project plan, always searching for fast solutions for the issues that arose keeping stakeholder´s engagement in the process. When referring to the research question “What are the best methods in choosing projects to fit in a portfolio?” Section 3 was able to properly respond that inquiry. The other research question “How can Portfolio Management increase the success rate of the individual projects?” was detailed Section 2 with the literature review. Finally, the case study displayed in Section 4 made a practical use of the theory in which it was possible to implement knowledge developed in this paper, thus allowing the Portfolio Manager and the individual projects to have a better perception of the complete Project Management process. Working with NGOs of different sizes and managing their expectations was the most challenging aspect of the task undertaken. Due to the level of knowledge by both students and NGOs communications and reports need to be improved for the next instances of the Portfolio Management project to ensure even better results.

153,A System Dynamics Model For Warehouse  Performance Measurement With Highly Seasonal,"this paper presents a model that identifies those variables that significantly affect the general performance of a warehouse with picker-to-parts storage systems, considering the dynamic nature of its processes and the possible non-linear relationships between its variables, under the effect of products with seasonal demand and long and short life cycles at the same time. as a methodology, a simulation model was developed under the systems dynamics (sd) paradigm. the main conclusions are that with this type of model it is possible to explain the behavior of the very structure of the warehouse and explain some non-linear relationships between its variables, such as the percentage of receipt on pallets, the percentage of picking and the total operating cost. the total operating cost is significantly affected when the percentage of receipt in full pallets decreases or when the percentage of picking increases. in relation to the percentage of income from full pallets, the imbalance between the receiving capacity in full and non-full pallets, generating accumulation of product to receive and penalization in costs due to delays in unloading (stand by) as the strategy upon receipt, full pallets decrease its percentage. the same happens with the picking percentage, as it increases, the increase in the total operating cost increases exponentially, because the pallets to be sent to customers cannot be processed on time, because there is also an imbalance between the capacity to prepare full and non -complete pallet orders.","warehouse operation, warehouse policies, seasonal products, life cycle","In this work we present a system dynamics model of a warehouse with picker-to-parts system that represent a major portion of warehouse operations in practice. Using this model, we identified that among the variables that are part of such type of warehouse there are always not necessarily linear relationships, this is the case between the percentage of product that enters the warehouse on full pallets, the percentage of picking and the total operating cost. The reasons are associated with the imbalance between the receiving capacity in full and non-full pallets, the first being 7.6 times greater, generating accumulation of product to receive and penalization in costs due to delays in unloading (stand by) as the strategy upon receipt full pallets decrease its percentage. The same happens with the picking percentage, as it increases, the increase in the total operating cost increases exponentially, because the pallets to be sent to customers cannot be processed on time, using a greater number of hours to make the same job due to delay; considering that, the imbalance between the capacity to prepare full and non- full pallet orders also influences, with their ratio being 2.9 times. Future work will analyze the relationship between the total cost of operation and other variables, such as the capacity of the reception area, the capacity of the area of preparation of orders or storage and the inclusion of the availability of vehicles and delays in their arrivals, as well such as staff turnover between processes and its effect on performance. For example, the lack of availability of vehicles or the delay in their arrival could increase the level of inventory since it would affect the continuous output of product and could increase the total operating cost, considering that more man-hours would be needed to make the same work. Also, if operating personnel are trained to do various tasks within the warehouse, the total operating cost could decrease because personnel could move between processes to level product flows.","demand and with long and short life products diego ramirez-malule, juan sebastián jaén-posada and juan g. villegas grupo de investigación aliado, departamento de ingeniería industrial universidad de antioquia udea calle 70 no. 52-21, medellín, colombia. diegof.ramirez@udea.edu.co, jjaen@udea.edu.co, juan.villegas@udea.edu.co",

155,Towards A Conceptual Framework On The Importance Of  Privacy And Security Concerns In Audit Data Analytics,"privacy and security concerns with big data have gained momentum in both research and business fields. organizations in general have long recognized the need of data analytics to increase quality and provide better value for financial statements users. audit firms, in particular, have made significant investments in the field of data analytics, as traditional auditing techniques have not kept pace with the evolving economy and large investments of organizations in data and technology. audit data analytics have become an increasingly important tool for auditors to increase the quality and performance of their audit. however, such implementation have raised the concerns for privacy and security of client data. the main objective of this paper is to provide a context to organizations by highlighting on the security and privacy concerns triggered by big data analytics and the importance of this matter in the audit sector. to this end, using an in-depth literature review, and drawing on a sound theoretical framework comprising utility maximization theory and procedural fairness theory, the paper proposes a conceptual model that depicts the relationships between privacy and security concerns, data analytics and audit quality. the model implications are discussed, and recommendations for future research are presented.","data analytics, audit quality",,"manal m. yunis myunis@lau.edu.lb raed el-khalil raed.elkhalil@lau.edu.lb miray ghanem miray.ghanem@lau.edu adnan kassar school of business lebanese american university beirut, lebanon",
156,A Risk-Based Management Approach In Minimizing  Occupational Accidents In Manufacturing Locator,"safety at work is very important to every industry and minimizing the risk of workplace accidents and injuries is of utmost importance in the discussion of occupational, health and safety (osh). increasing density of manufacturing companies as locators in a high-growth export processing zone in laguna philippines led to the conduct of this study aimed at analyzing the causes of accidents and assessing the risk factors and osh practices with the end in view of determining a better approach in osh management. actual cases and accounts of occupational accidents, their causes, and resulting injuries were gathered via interviews and survey questionnaires. an assessment was made on the osh programs, the work environment and organizational factors. the results of the study pointed to the importance of integrating risk management in performing osh management as non-identification of hazards was found to be a major cause of workplace accidents and injuries. as such, an improved osh management model was developed with the integration of risk management centered on collaboration among process owners in putting in place a proactive, ongoing process to identify and assess high-priority risks and hazards, the critical element of any effective safety and health program.",risk management,"Different agencies promote numerous training, seminars, programs, and practices in the Philippines to prevent occupational accidents. However, with these existing programs and practices to prevent occupational accidents, cases of occupational accidents and injuries in the Philippines are still increasing. Also, despite the safety strategies in the workplaces, occupational accidents and incidents have been increasing. This study identified the significant factors or causes of accidents affecting the occupational accidents in the Philippine heavy manufacturing industry through the statistical analysis. The factors that significantly contribute are exposure to hazardous work environments followed by unsafe working conditions and unsafe acts like not using the provided PPEs. This result shows that despite the existing safety programs and practices being applied today, the risks of occupational accidents in the heavy manufacturing industry are high. The safety programs and practices being implemented are not enough to prevent occupational accidents in the Philippine manufacturing industry. In line with this, the author of the study finds that performing management of risks of occupational accidents is a great help in reducing occupational accidents. Risk management and safety management are both critical in preventing occupational accidents. Occupational accident in the Philippine manufacturing industry was in level which still can be prevented. Therefore, most common occupational accidents and factors should be prevented with the cooperation of Occupational Safety and Health programs and Risk Management. To reduce occupational accidents in the Philippine heavy manufacturing industries, integration of Risk Management strategies in the planning stage of the Occupational Safety and Health Programs where hazards and risks of accidents are assessed will significantly help. Risk Management is to continually allow us to identify and assess work hazards, implement controls to remove or reduce the risk to the lowest possible level and review these hazards to ensure they are maintained at the lowest reasonable risk. The risk management process will consistently identify hazards by applying the process to all of the activities. Risk assessments should be undertaken if one of the following events occurs: 1. Before setting up and using any new premises as a place of work. 2. When planning/designing work processes. 3. Before installation, erection, commissioning, or alteration of the plant. 4. Whenever changes are made to the workplace and the system or work process 5. Before hazardous substances are introduced into a place of work or process. 6. When new or additional health and safety information relevant to our business becomes available. 5. Recommendation Occupational safety and health programs, training, and safety practices applied by the Philippines' heavy manufacturing industries nowadays are identified in this study. Accident prevention begins with a clear understanding of factors that play vital roles in their causation; the study identified the significant factors of accidents affecting occupational accidents and the association of the factors of accidents with the resulting accidents and injuries. Estimated risks of the factors of accidents, their resulting accidents, and injuries were also identified in this study. Further study can be conducted to determine the causes or factors contributing to the identified significant occupational accidents and their resulting accident and injuries. The study focused on the cases of non-fatal occupational accidents gathered from the heavy manufacturing industries in the Philippines. Future researchers may perform a study that will cover occupational accidents from the small and medium manufacturing industries, including fatal accidents and near-miss accidents in the study.

157,A Workplace Design Improvement For Visual Inspection              In A Philippine-Based Aircraft Parts Company:,"poor ergonomics leads to frustrated and fatigued workers that may not perform their job like they were trained which could create a product quality issue. in workstations for visual inspections, operators can have visual fatigue due to excessive usage of devices with light emissions, glare from inspection or poor lighting and too many components to check within a very short period. similar conditions exist in a leading manufacturer of aircraft parts for the commercial and business jet aircraft markets. visual quality of parts is what works in an aircraft interior that showcases comfort, safety and even luxury, the sensual benefits conveyed to passengers. providing standard operating procedures and reference target specifications will not be enough to ensure consistency and reliability of visual inspection results without first identifying the ergonomic risk factors in a visual inspection workstation. accordingly, with the heavy use of the faculty of eyesight and other faculties of cognition to assess visual quality performance of aircraft parts products, this study aims to assess the importance of incorporating cognitive ergonomics in the design of work conditions and environments that enhance cognitive functioning at work, and as a consequence, improve worker productivity and product quality.","visual quality, ergonomic risks","Upon analyzing the results from the survey, the researcher concluded that the workplace on the visual inspection area has ergonomic medium risk in the visual inspection process and needs intervention to prevent long term effect on the inspector’s health. After a data analysis of the researcher using SPSS for the productivity, it can be said that it is inconclusive since there is no relationship among the variables treated as dependent variables. In contrast, it was determined that the significant factor’s that affects the quality of the output using SPSS are: visual inspection of the unit, use of computer, workplace design, ergonomics in the workplace, and the presence of pain. After the assessment made by the researcher on the visual inspection area, it was proven that improvement of the situation in the workplace design with the incorporation of cognitive ergonomics with the physical workplace design factors should be made. The following are the recommended improvement; provide light/lamp in the visual inspection area to improve the lighting condition, relocate the position of the computer to minimize the risk on the inspector’s health, embed the actual pictures of the unit in work instruction to serve as information display that will guide and support the inspector. It is also recommended to provide a shadow board for a tool that will be used in visual inspection to improve the recognition of defects. 5. Recommendation It is also recommended that the parts aircraft manufacturer recognize the benefits of cognitive ergonomics in the visual inspection area. The support of top management in improving the workplace through cognitive ergonomics will improve visual inspection quality, thus decreasing customer complaints regarding visual defects. Based on the study's preceding findings, further studies of productivity analysis should use different approaches and tools assessment. As a result of ANOVA, it is inconclusive for the productivity analysis since there is no relationship seen among the variables treated as dependent variables. There are still variables that fit the dependent variable that may lead to a conclusion.","a cognitive ergonomic approach terrylyn m. narvaez and marvin i. noroña school of industrial engineering and engineering management mapúa university, manila, philippines terrylyn_benitz@yahoo.com; minorona@mapua.edu.ph",
158,Analysis Of Factors Affecting Road Traffic Accidents In The  City Of Makati Philippines,"road accidents is one of the highest causes of morbidity and fatality in the philippines. the number of vehicular accidents has been on a rising trend, doubled from 63,072 incidents in 2007 to 116,906 in 2018. according to the latest who data published in 2018, road traffic accident deaths in philippines reached 10,624 which accounted for 1.74% of total deaths in the country. the age adjusted death rate is 11.40 per 100,000 of population ranks philippines #118 in the world. road traffic accidents was the 14th leading cause of death in the philippines in life expectancy but ranks second in non-disease-caused deaths next to assault. in metro manila or the national capital region, approximately 7,000 filipinos die every year, and thousands are disabled because of road traffic accidents. this study was conducted primarily to assess the factors that affect road traffic accidents and determine the significant relationships between causal factors and accidents and propose corresponding strategies to reduce risks of road traffic accidents and minimize fatal and non-fatal injuries therefrom.",vehicular accidents,"Based on the hypothesis testing, there is a significant relationship between the road character and vehicle's type, driver's gender has a significant relationship to the type of the vehicle; therefore, the hypothesis testing for the relationship of the vehicle factor and user demographic is accepted. The use of regression to the factors was found to have a clear influential factor in road traffic accidents. The factors found significant are the driver's age, gender, vehicle age, road character, road lane character, traffic condition, type of vehicles, driving experience, and time of accidents – these are the main factors that influence road traffic accidents. The study shows that when there is a change in a subfactor, it can also affect the other subfactors contributing to road traffic accidents. Take a scenario when a female driver has a longer driving experience than a male driver; still, they can contribute to the same on the road traffic accident occurring along roadways. There is a need for government to address a more fundamental problem of inadequate and inaccurate traffic accident data. Without establishing an effective accident report system, it would be difficult not only to monitor the level of road traffic safety but also to formulate and implement cost-effective road safety programs. With the rapidly increasing vehicle number, the need for attention to improving road safety is a prime concern. Mitigating measures should be taken to eliminate road traffic accidents that are occurring in the City of Makati. The results demonstrate the relationship between road traffic accidents, gender, age, infrastructure, and vehicle factor. In particular, the driver's age, gender, vehicle age, road character, road lane character, traffic condition, type of vehicles, driving experience, and time of accidents confirm the importance of factors to investigate to lessen road traffic accidents in Makati. The identification of these factors leads to the establishment of specific preventive measures that aimed to minimize accidents. The implementation of the new driver license systems together with the black point system would help lessen the road traffic accident. Finally, the need to improve the systematic recording of accident data has been identified. Improving the road traffic accident reports forms can also reduce road traffic accidents. This data is based on the vehicles involved in the accident and can help distinguish if what factor should be updated. However, some relationships between accidents related variables such as the road signs, traffic lights, and unfamiliarity remain unexplained. This contribution should be verified in further studies.

160,Total Productive Maintenance In The                                      Philippine Rice Production Sector,"rice production is an important aspect of the philippine food supply and economy. mechanized farming has received extensive government support with farm equipment and training on the basics of operations, repairs and maintenance through local cooperatives tasked with its future replacement. thus, it would be imperative to systematize maintenance practices to ensure proper upkeep and operations. extant literature highlighted benefits of total productive maintenance (tpm) in manufacturing environments but not in the agricultural sector, particularly in rice production. this research was aimed to institutionalize tpm practices at the local level by showing its benefits in terms of the better equipment utilization, and improvement in yield. the study chose for its research locale the province of occidental mindoro, an agricultural area devoted for rice production, which is a source of employment of almost 80% of its population. after an assessment of maintenance practices, areas of improvement were incorporated in a tpm strategy model grounded at the local level, not as complex as in a manufacturing setup, but a straightforward approach of equipping the farm cooperative personnel with a tpm mind set in view of the benefits of longer equipment lives and improved reliability that will consequently maximize crop yield and profitability.","rice production, farm cooperative","The first objective of the paper was to evaluate the maintenance practices of the mechanized rice production and it was obtained through interview, observation and conducted survey. The researcher concluded that the performance of the machine and equipment in terms of availability, durability, functionality, quality, reliability and safety are below the overall equipment effectiveness percentage which is 80%, the rice production players were all dissatisfied in the performance and gave a rating of below 40%. Also, the results manifested that the maintenance cost per month which consisted mainly of replacement of parts, change oil and breakdown repair costs roughly 1001-3000 pesos per month which contributed with the total operational cost of 20,001-30,000 pesos per cropping which is very high as compared to the average operating cost of 19,000 pesos per cropping as per Department of Agriculture (2019). This high cost was resulted because of no maintenance and that the agricultural players experienced frequent breakdown of 11-20 hours machine per month. The research’s objective number 2 of this research was to determine the significant factors affecting the decisions related to the mechanization and maintenance practices of rice production players in the Philippines. This objective was achieved through conducting survey to rice production players and statistical analyses. Significant factors were identified by using Factor Analysis and Regression Analysis. Based on the results, the significant factors are: land areas of farm, number of machineries and equipment, involvement in rice production players and the years in the field of rice production. The last objective was to formulate a TPM-based strategy and model in employing best practices in the maintenance of machines & equipment in the rice production sector towards better productivity and cost efficiency. It was attained by using statistical analysis such as the test of normality, factor analysis, linear regression and multiple regression. The framework developed on this research paper was suited to the needs of the rice production players in a TPM based framework. The research question for this research is if Total Productive Maintenance can be adopted in Philippine rice production to address local issues of high operations and maintenance costs in view of the country’s thrust for food sustainability and affordability was answered by obtaining the three objectives of this research. Based on the results and discussions, this TPM based framework will work effectively in rice production sector. 5. Recommendation This research study recommends the adoption of the TPM based framework to the rice production sector in the Philippines in order to address the local issues of high operations and maintenance costs in view of the country’s thrust for food sustainability and affordability. Significant effects will be the reduced breakdown cost, maintenance cost and operational cost. With lower operational cost, there will also be a reduction in the price of rice, thus the rice will become affordable to all the Filipinos. Future studies may look into other sector of agriculture with different machines and equipment if the developed framework will work.

162,Designing A Low-Cost Thermal Energy Storage System For  Small-Scale Tobacco Farmers In Zimbabwe,"the main objective of the current paper is to design a forced convection thermal energy storage (tes) system adoptable, adaptable and affordable by small-scale tobacco farmers in zimbabwe. the design’s fabrication would comprise of locally available materials. the aim of the design is to save energy resources applied in tobacco curing processes such as solar, biogas, liquefied petroleum gas (lpg), coal, electricity, firewood, and paddy husks as is the case in sri lanka. several researchers have worked to introduce new fuel sources in tobacco curing. there has also been a major focus on structural improvement of tobacco barns through raising barn interior insulation levels, selection of ideal construction materials as well as plugging all existing and potential thermal leakage points during regular maintenance. no research has been carried out focusing on introduction of thermal energy storage systems to complement other energy utilization efficiency initiatives being taken. this paper specifically designs a thermal energy storage system comprising of brickwork and a steel dome as an energy efficiency improvement measure in tobacco curing. apart from tobacco curing, the designed tes system would be applicable to drying processes of other crops such as maize, paprika and other fruits and vegetables.","latent, sensible, thermochemical","An ideal 5.3565m³ sensible heat thermal energy storage system was designed for use by small-scale tobacco farmers during curing of their crop. It is meant to complement energy-efficiency measures being undertaken by other researchers. With a total investment of US$2 500 which can be undertaken in phases for two years and all building materials locally available, the project is implementable and recommended. The benefits are the energy and raw fuel resource consumption reduction, deforestation reversal, marked success in agroforestry projects as well as the greenhouse gas emission reduction. The heat storage material are rock pebbles which are in abundance for free in the exception of the transportation costs. There will be marked improvement in product quality as barns begin to receive consistent heating for desired energy levels. The project attains a quick payback time and profitability and it has got a lifetime of 20 years with minimum maintenance.

163,Empirical Modelling Of The Water Supply Crisis In The  Mpumalanga Province Of South Africa,"large swaths of rural communities in south africa are faced with water shortages. the mpumalanga province is one of the most hard-hit areas in the country with very unskilled water administrators and old infrastructure exacerbating the problem. lack of access to clean piped water affects local communities, surrounding agricultural farms and the few available industries in the province. the acid mine drainage at abandoned mine shafts also adds another dimension to the problem. in this research, the opportunities for poor communities to have access to potable water and also store enough water that will cater to the demand of water supply is investigated. the effective pumping systems strategic management are also addressed in this study to assist management to maintain the leaking and burst pipes. the delay in attending water related queries means more losses of water. an empirical investigation is conducted in the mpumalanga province to identify the areas that have a water shortage and implement systems and strategies that will result in enough portable water to the affected rural communities. the development of the empirical model and its testing with data obtained through questionnaires administered in the province forms the focus of this paper.","pumping system, water, communities, mpumalanga","The study concluded that a lot of rural communities in the study areas are facing challenges with water services which range from lack of capacity, skilled people, illegal connections and droughts which resulted into fountains being dry 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 0 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2 0.25 0.3 0.35 Head (m) Flow Rate (m3/s) Head (m) Vs Flow Rate Pump Sym 1 Pump Sys 2 Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management Sao Paulo, Brazil, April 5 - 8, 2021","motsi ephrey matlakala department of mechanical and industrial engineering technology university of johannesburg johannesburg, south africa motsiephrey@gmail.com daramy vandi von kallon department of mechanical and industrial engineering technology university of johannesburg johannesburg, south africa dkallon@uj.ac.za","References

164,Systems Dynamics Modelling Of The Water Supply  Problem In The Limpopo Province Of South Africa,"most of poor rural communities based in the north-eastern parts of south africa such as in the limpopo province face shortage of water with mostly no access to clean portable water. the water shortage is caused by the lack of proper management of the existing water systems, such that water is lost in the system through leaking and burst pipes. the water scarcity has become the top agenda priority for the local governments in the province especially considering the drought level due to lack of rain. the issue of water scarcity affects households as well as the industrial and agricultural sectors serving these rural communities. most of the areas have contaminated water because of lack of proper purification plants and pumping systems. the purpose of this study is to model the water supply chain to determine the nature and causes of poor delivery in the system. system dynamic model is developed using the vensim software. the system is simulated to determine opportunities for improvement. the systems dynamics modelling is discussed herein.","pumping system, water, communities, pipes, efficiency","In this study, a systems dynamic model was developed to investigate the interaction between the population and water sources in rural areas of Limpopo Province. The results in Figure 7 shows that if there is no proper type of management, the rural areas will suffer a shortage of water. It is also worth noting (referring from Figure 7) that the communities did not lack water at the beginning but due to lack of proper management there was water shortage. The study areas are facing challenges with water services range from lack of capacity, skilled people, illegal connections and droughts. The challenges affect the delivery of water services to the communities and need to be addressed with the purpose to improve the water delivery. The health of people is also at risk because of consuming untreated water. The abstracted water needs to be treated to meet the portable quality standards for drinkable water before it is distributed to the consumers. The infrastructures must be maintained regularly so that they can last for a longer period. Figure 7 shows that the demand of water supply can be increased and as the population increases this will start to decrease over the months. The systems dynamic model (Figure 4 and 6) helps with determining the population growth and management of water services. The systems dynamic model gives the opportunities to improve the water services and manage the population. The vandalism and mismanagement of water can be addressed well by providing trainings that will help with management of community facilities and water.

Especially in the Industrial 4.0 era like today. The critical role of the internet, digital retail, and search engines is increasingly essential; it also triggers a market shift where more people are turning to buy products online. Certainly makes it easier for consumers to buy the products they want. We also conclude that the government must provide alternatives for Indonesia to prepare good jobs when there is a shift in Indonesia's economic culture, which has begun to shift to the digital economy. Wherewith this cultural shift, of course, there is a reshuffle in the form of organization that must be carried out by middle-class and upper-class companies. We can also conclude that there are still many Indonesians who have not realized the potential of the digital economy in Indonesia.

175,Analysis Of Handgrip Strength And Anthropometric  Measurements Of Manufacturing Workers In The Philippines,"in industrial applications, it is essential to know and estimate the handgrip strength (hgs) of workers to accordingly designate them to appropriate job specifications. most of the manufacturing companies have a manual or semi- automatic product processing unit; thus, it will require an ample amount of dexterity that constitutes to the exertion of grip force. this study aims to assess the relationship between the anthropometric and handgrip strength of the manufacturing workers that can be used both the industrial sector and government implementing agencies. nine hand dimensions and thirteen body measurements in standing position with the hgs considering both genders were tested among sixty participants. the hgs of both hands were used in developing regression models for anthropometric measurements and demographic profile. the results show that the gender, age group, tenure, five hand dimensions and nine body measurements in standing position significantly affects the hgs. the findings will provide companies and government labour and safety agencies comprehensive information on the anthropometric and handgrip strength measurements of the manufacturing workers. the results therefore can provide relevant perspectives in terms of the proper designation of workers and improves the ergonomics and safety of the workers employed both in domestic and international workplaces.",hand dimensions,"An experiment was conducted to assess the relationship of the Handgrip Strength with the demographic profile, hand dimensions, and body measurements in the standing position of male and female manufacturing workers. The analysis showed that among the subjects identified demographic profile, the age group and gender were the only variables that are statistically correlated with the Handgrip Strength as well as with hand dimensions and body measurements in standing position. Pearson correlation showed that both the hand dimensions (hand length, maximum handbreadth, index finger length, middle finger length, and ring finger length) and body measurements in standing position (vertical grip reach, knuckle height, fingertip height, elbow height, eye height, stature, span, upper limb height, and shoulder grip length) have a positive correlation with Handgrip Strength. It is concluded that the age group and gender affect the outcome of the handgrip force. Generally, 18-32 years have a higher grip force than the 33-46 years for both males and females. It also shows that males have a higher variation of grip force than females for both age groups. The multivariate results noticed a significant correlation between HGS and body measurements in standing position with age group and gender. The findings of this study can estimate the handgrip force from the gender, age group, hand dimension, and body measurements in standing position. This research would be potentially considered as the first comprehensive study in the Philippines with regards to identifying the relationship between the Handgrip Strength and Anthropometric measurements of Filipino manufacturing workers. This study serves as the first step in making an Anthropometric and handgrip standard for a specific job requirement in industrial applications. The study’s academic perspectives, therefore, could further improve the efficiency, safety, and health of the manufacturing workers and will eventually improve the company profits. Future studies could increase the number of participants and age groups to widen the span of the results. And to identify if there are any differences among the work departments handgrip strength values and requirements. And to use structural equation modelling since it could estimate multiple and interrelated dependence in single analysis a more efficient way of evaluating the data.","klint allen mariñas school of graduate studies mapúa university manila, 1002 metro manila, philippines klintallen_marinas@yahoo.com rex aurelius robielos school of industrial engineering and engineering management mapúa university manila, 1002 metro manila, philippines racrobielos@mapua.edu.ph yung-tsan jou industrial and systems engineering department chung yuan christian university zhongli district, taoyuan city, taiwan ytjou@cycu.edu.tw",
176,Analysis Of Factors That Affecting Safety Risk Perception In  Oil Refinery Industry,"this research examined the risk perceptions of workers in the petroleum processing industry sector. the background of this study was based on the exploitation, production, and distribution activities in the oil and gas industry sector which are extensively carried out to meet high market demand. however, it also needs to be balanced with a sound safety system to prevent workplace accidents. the main idea of this study was slightly different from previous research. the approach used is the perspective of workers to find safety risks that frequently occurred in their work environment. this study employed the structural equation modelling (sem) method to find out the main factors that influence workers' perception of the occupational safety risk. based on the result of the analysis, individual attitude & behaviour and work situation & target are two factors that have a strong influence on workers risk perception. this finding is essential for further analysis in developing action plans for accident preventions in a company, particularly in the petroleum processing industry sector.",,"Work accidents, especially in the petroleum processing industry sector, are not something that cannot be avoided. One effort to prevent work accidents is by anticipating unsafe actions and unsafe behaviour long before the accident occurs. Another effort is to map the factors that have an influence on risk perception from the perspective of the worker. Based on the results of this study, it can be concluded that the main factors causing occupational accidents are individual attitude & behaviour and situation and work target. So, the company can make improvement in these factors to avoid occupational accidents happen later on. Where workers spend a lot of time directly in the work location with various kinds of hazards attached to their work.

177,Analysis Factors That Influence Mall Customer Loyalty In  Semarang,"to maintain its presence in society, malls need to maintain and increase the loyalty of their customers. nowadays, customers prefer malls that have high value and give more satisfaction to them. based on preliminary surveys, it shows that people who are satisfied with mall is not necessarily loyal to the mall. this study effort to find the relation of the mall’s environment and value to the customer’s value, satisfaction, and loyalty using structural equation modeling-partial least square (sem-pls). the results show that the most significant positive effect on customer’s loyalty is mall’s value. recommendations are given to mall developers relating to the mall’s value variable, namely ""wow factor"" for the mall brand and use of technological advancements to facilitate transactions between customers and outlets, and ease for customers to get promotional information.",mall,"Mall customer loyalty is defined as the tendency of customers to continue shopping at the mall and recommend it to others (Rabbanee et al 2012). Customers visiting a shopping mall not only separate but also for other activities such as entertainment (Rabbanee et al 2012). In this case, the developer’s mall utilizes customer loyalty to increase sales at outlets in the mall, which in turn can provide a profit for the owners of the mall (Rabbanee et al 2012). Based on the results of the research hypothesis and the calculation of effects between latent variables in the model of this research is that the variables provide the most significant positive effect on customer loyalty is Mall Value. To maintain and increase customer loyalty to mall in the city, recommendations are given to the developer of the mall will include matters relating to the variable Mall Value. The first recommendation is bringing up the ""Wow Factor"" at Brand Mall because the customer of shopping center goes to the mall not just to shop alone, but also for entertainment, in this case, shopping center must excel in four fields, mall design, high comfort level, diverse brands as well as the diversity of drinks and food sold therein (Caulfield 2015). The second is the development of technology should be an opportunity for the owner of the mall where the mall owner can use that not only link between the consumer and the retailer physically but also digitally. Allowing consumers to search for products or services online and purchase offline, or purchase online and then pick up the goods at the outlets (Robaton 2016). The third, the use of smartphones is common in today's society, thus smartphone applications on the utilization can be optimized. One of them is by using the Beacon, a device that is capable of communicating with the smartphone by using signal BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) within a certain range. These beacons are installed in the mall. Beacon works by the activation of applications that exist within smartphone so Beacon works with the user's permission. Through this technology, a consumer does not need to open the application because an automatic message will be sent to the consumer smartphone. It is not only sending promotional messages but also a reminder system on the application where the application will remind users ""wishlist"" that have been made previously (Robaton 2016).","nia budi puspitasari, dyah ika rinawati, zainal fanani rosyada and awalya tiffany jonenetha department of industrial engineering diponegoro university semarang, indonesia niabudipuspitasari@lecturer.undip.ac.id, dyah.ika@gmail.com, rosyada@lecturer.undip.ac.id, joenetha06@gmail.com",
178,Concise Consumer Needs For Women Muslim Fashion By  Integrating Online Product Reviews And Designer Voice,"consumer needs in muslim clothing product development have become the basic needs of designers developing products. muslim clothes are a product that is growing very fast in indonesia. one tool to determine the needs of consumers today is online product reviews (oprs). oprs are written by consumers and tell about their satisfaction with the products that they have purchased. oprs are also useful for online shops on e-commerce platforms to support purchasing decisions, build consumer trust, and show shop reputation. this paper aims to examine the use of oprs from an e-commerce business perspective capable of influencing consumer buying decisions in an online and offline store and knowing whether oprs influence the designers in developing muslim clothing product design. in this research findings, oprs and star ratings influence consumer’s buying decisions. for designers, oprs might affect in design development. it provides information product requirements from consumers from positive or negative reviews. some statements in oprs were incompatible with the personal opinion of the designer. this review provides new insights for the upcoming study in the field of online shop user rankings, evaluations and designers.","consumer, fashion, oprs, muslim","This study shows that OPRs can influence consumer decisions in buying Muslim clothing products, both online and offline. This study is consistent with research conducted by (Constantinides and Holleschovsky 2016; Helversen et al. 2018; Ketelaar et al. 2015). This study also proves that OPRs are a collection of information directly from consumers about opinions after using the product, as well as information that replaces the stage of extracting consumer voices in the product development cycle. This study corroborates the idea of previous research that uses OPRs as a supporter of consumer voices (Wang 2016; Xiao et al. 2017; Willemsen et al. 2012; Ireland and Liu 2018). In this study, it turns out that from the designer side, distrust of OPRs is caused by no objective review, the involvement of robotics systems in OPRs that are not purely the voice of consumers. This is consistent with the previous theory, which says that there is a possibility of OPRs being hijacked by computer systems or robots. However, OPRs, as part of big data technology, are very influential on consumers and business systems in general. This is according to the previous theory delivered by (Racherla et al. 2012; Mo et al. 2015; Chong et al. 2016; Folse et al. 2016). OPRs can influence business processes, become a tool to attract markets, and influence consumers as a tool to compete with each other writing reviews. If it aims to bring down, competitors write negative reviews on the e-commerce platform. This is in line with the theories conveyed by (Perera et al. 2018; Cooper 2018; Nurcahyanie et al. 2020). Future research can use big data analysis with specific algorithms that indicate the suitability of consumer needs and the interests of designers.","yunia dwie nurcahyanie industrial engineering department pgri adi buana university surabaya, indonesia yuniadwie@unipasby.ac.id moses laksono singgih and dyah sari dewi industrial and system engineering department sepuluh nopember institute of technology surabaya, indonesia moseslsinggih@ie.its.ac.id, dyah@ie.its.ac.id",

181,Development Of A Multi Echelon Economic Dispatch Model  For Combined Optimization Between The Production And,"combined optimization between the production and distribution side of electricity must be done because electricity produced must be sent directly to the customer. electricity cannot be saved so it must be produced as much as demand. for this reason, the production system must consider losses in the network, where there are two types of losses, namely transmission losses and distribution losses. power plant scheduling using economic dispatch does not present combined optimization. therefore, this research has produced a multi echelon economic dispatch (med) model. this model is able to make a combined optimization between the production and distribution/shipping sides. not only that, this model has also divided shipments into two parts, transmission and distribution, so that more detailed production scheduling and electricity delivery can be obtained while minimizing fuel costs.","economic dispatch, simulation, optimization","and Future Research 6.1 . Conclusion The Multi echelon Economic Dispatch (MED) model has succeeded in making a combined optimization between the production and distribution sides of electricity. Optimization on the production side is in the form of scheduling power plants while optimization on the distribution side is minimizing electricity mileage. Not only that, this model is also able to present electricity production and distribution in more detail. Electricity that reaches the customer can be known from the origin of the plant. And also, the losses incurred by each plant to send electricity to the customer can be known with certainty, where this advantage is not shared by the classic economic dispatch model. Another benefit of this model can be used for incentive programs for environmentally friendly power plants. This is because minimizing costs at power plants will tend to use low-cost, high-emission power plants, low-emission power plants with more expensive costs will not be selected and cannot compete with plants that are not environmentally friendly. 6.2 . Future Research Costs and emissions in this study are nonlinear, causing complexity in modelling and computing. Therefore, the initial MED model was designed for single objective cases, further research is needed to develop the MED model with multi objective cases.

186,Environmental Impact Reduction In Broiler Chicken Farm  Using Life Cycle Assessment In The Implementation Of,"chicken manure waste resulting from the process of raising broiler chickens has an impact on the surrounding community and employees. using life cycle assessment (lca), an analysis of the existing chicken breeding process with the scope of gate to gate is carried out. there are two outputs of chicken cultivation results, namely broiler chickens and non-product in the form of chicken droppings. based on processing using simapro v.9 software with impact 2002+ method, the output of chicken manure has the most impact on the environment. the biggest impact produced in the form of human health. through the analysis of the problems, recommendations are given for improvement using a sensitivity analysis approach to reduce the impact of chicken farming output. from this research we obtained that substituting soybean meal into fish meal and raising 20% as a food raw material are alternatives that can reduce the environmental impact. recommendations for processing chicken manure can use circular economy principles i.e. recycle by processing chicken manure into fertilizer. some other alternatives can sell chicken manure directly to the fertilizer industry distributor.",impact2002+,"The broiler chicken farm process produces four categories of damage impacts, namely human health, ecosystem quality, climate change and resources. The biggest environmental impact is human health. The cause of damage to the human health category was caused by the ammonia content generated from the waste of chicken manure produced. These chemical compounds contribute to the decline in the quality of ecosystems and public health. The most possible alternative to reduce the impact on the ecosystem from chicken farming waste is to replace the composition of chicken feed from soybean meal into fish meal. Another alternative to reduce the environmental impact can also be done by using chicken manure waste as fertilizer, besides that waste can also be minimized by selling chicken manure. 2.","circular economy purnawan adi wicaksono and devi kaswara industrial engineering department, faculty of engineering diponegoro university semarang, indonesia purnawan@ft.undip.ac.id, devikaswaraa@gmail.com",
187,Enterprise Risk Management Disclosure And Firm Value:  The Role Of Risk Monitoring Committee,"enterprise risk management is one of a firm's strategies to achieve the goals. meanwhile, the risk monitoring committee is a corporate organ evaluating enterprise risk management. however, not many researchers have discussed the role of the risk monitoring committee. the previous research paid more attention to the role of the risk management committee. the purpose of this study is to identify the role of the risk monitoring committee on the relationship between enterprise risk management disclosure and firm value. the role of the risk monitoring committee was viewed based on size, independent member, female member, education level, financial expert, risk management expert, and meeting. this research was conducted on commercial banks listed on the indonesian stock exchange within a period of 2016-2018. 126 samples were collected using a purposive sampling technique through observation. the results showed that five variables such as committee size, female member, financial expert, risk management expert, and meeting moderated the relationship between enterprise risk management disclosure and firm value, yet the committee of independent member and education level did not moderate the relationship between enterprise risk management disclosure and firm value.","banking, risk management, baxter et al. 2013","In recent years, the regulators and investors have paid more attention to the ERM disclosure information. One of the government's efforts to have more effective risk control was by establishing the RMC. However, this attention has not been followed by the increasing number of studies discussing the topic. At present, not many researchers have discussed the role of RMC. The statistical results of this study showed that the effectiveness of ERM disclosure on firm value was influenced by the RMC characteristics. This study theoretically supported the literature on corporate governance and risk management, particularly in banking industries. This study is also practically expected to provide inputs to regulators and company management that a ""strong"" RMC is greatly effective to improve the market performance. This study has two limitations. First, the research was only conducted in the banking sector since the policy to form RMC was only required by banks. Since limited by the use of small samples, this topic may become one productive area for future research. Further researchers may also evaluate the implementation of ERM and firm value in both banking and non-banking companies that the companies which have no RMC will be interested in forming a similar committee. Second, the results identified that the average level of ERM disclosure was still low, at 44 percent or still below 50 percent which was probably due to the ERM disclosure which was only based on the domestic banking regulations. Therefore, researchers may then combine the global ERM model initiated by COSO with the local ERM model established by the regulators to produce more comprehensive conclusions.","ni wayan rustiarini and ni nyoman ayu suryandari accounting department mahasaraswati denpasar university denpasar, indonesia rusti_arini@unmas.ac.id",

The developed model is more applicable in the real situation as it considers both the damage factor in product and permissible delay in payments. The model showed lower order quantity and higher inventory cost compared to the previous studies. Permissible delay in payment can be used by company to earn some extra profit, but the company can also be fined if the product stock has not been sold out.

For that industry, the production process runs continuously under expectation without or minimum downtime may cause some extremely high cost or opportunity lost. Therefore, the availability of spare parts in the warehouse is important to handle, as well as to keep the warehouse performance indicator achieved. The classification of spare parts helps management to focus on very critical items. Amongst 465 non-routine spare parts in the company, category A, B, and C are 4.09%, 13.33%, 82.58% respectively. Based on ADI-CV analysis, around 97% displays the lumpy pattern. Based on the examination of three inventory methods to the non-routine spare parts, it is found that the reliability-based methods provide better performance compared to the continuous and periodic review methods, more significant even compare to the existing min-max method. The possible reasons for this situation due to careful attention to the demand spare part, which is considered as the optimal replacement policy that was calculated first. This will keep the spare parts requirement consider the reliability characteristics of equipment where the spare parts equipped. The reliability-based method taking into account the reliability factor, lead time, standard deviation of demand, continuously checking items with a fixed number of orders, and the desired target service level at the beginning of the calculation, which it does not yet have in the existing method. There is a possibility of some management adjustments may be required to determine the inventory policy following the reliability-based inventory methods. The continuous examination of the spare parts stock ensures updated information towards uncertain demand for replacement.

192,Food Security Model In Corn Commodity Concerning On  Welfare Of Corn Farmers And Chicken Farmers In East Java,"food is one of the basic human needs. government has set strategic commodity targets, one of which is corn and chicken. corn is an important agricultural commodity for humans and livestock. there is a challenge where the increase in corn production is going slow so far. as a result, the speed of increasing demand for corn cannot be pursued to increase production. this also has an impact on chicken farmers which have a mutualism symbiotic with corn farmers. the selling price of corn and the right price of fodder will produce the right price of chicken and chicken eggs. this condition will have an impact to the welfare of corn and chicken farmers. this study aims to project the adequacy of corn both for humans and fodder by concerning the welfare of corn farmers and chicken farmers with parameters of corn and fodder prices. an approach with a dynamic system simulation is carried out to achieve a balance between the welfare of corn farmers and chicken farmers to be able to maintain their future existence based on corn prices and fodder prices. this approach is used because of the ability of this model to solve complex system behaviour between variables.","food security, corn demand, fodder demand, corn proce, fodder price","In this research, modelling was designed with causal loop diagrams and stock flow diagrams. Both causal loop diagrams and stock flow diagrams consist of four sub-models. The implication of this research is the resulting model can be used for the East Java government to carry out its food security policy by ensuring the availability of corn as one of the achievement pillars of food security. The policy includes giving instructions to plant corn commodities, at least once a year. Therefore, food stability may also be achieved. In addition, the government can also use the unused land to plant corn and increase corn productivity by implementing a tight spacing system on corn plants in order to increase the corn production. Meanwhile, other regional governments that produce large corn, such as Central Java, South Sulawesi, and regions that have quite large chicken farmers such as West Java, Central Java, Banten, and North Sumatra can meet the needs of fodder by setting the prices affordable. Thus, this can also encourage the existence of farmers to maintain stable production of chicken and chicken eggs at affordable prices. However, the underlying weakness of this research, emerges in the aspect of parameter assessment of welfare. The corn farmers’ welfare was assessed based on merely the selling price of corn and based on the purchase price of fodder for chicken farmers’ welfare. In the future it is necessary to assess the welfare indicators more broadly, not only from income. One of them is the approach to understanding human development. In addition, other strategic commodities e.g. soybean as the main source of protein might also be an option for future research.

194,Impact Of Infrastructure Development On Economic Growth  (Case Study Of Lumajang Regency): A System Dynamics,"infrastructure in indonesia is currently still considered low, both in terms of quality and quantity when compared to other countries, especially in southeast asia, where the availability of infrastructure is a condition for a region to change the potential of the region into economic benefits for its people. realizing this, the government is currently trying to increase the availability of infrastructure in all sectors needed to leverage the national economy. in fulfilling infrastructure needs to increase the added value of a region's potential to regional income, it is influenced by several important variables that need to be considered by policy makers in developing infrastructure financing strategies. this research aims to see and measure the impact of infrastructure development on economic growth by taking a case study in lumajang regency, east java province. lumajang regency was chosen as the object of research considering the region's grdp growth is quite high while its economic growth is low. the dynamic system method is used in the hope that it can see the issue of infrastructure development as a whole both based on its impact and its linkages with other sectors. with the ability to simulate simultaneously, obtained the role of sectors that contribute to the added value of the construction sector with a proportion of 45.7% followed by the transportation and communication sector at 33.2% in second place, and the agricultural sector ranked 3rd with a score of 15%. based on the results of various scenarios of infrastructure development policy, it is expected that the best policy is to increase grdp.","infrastructure, economic growth","Based on the results of the applied scenario, the value-added value in each sector is a manifestation of the profit from each rupiah invested in a sector. The construction sector, the clean water gas electricity sector, and the transportation sector are sequentially a priority sector with an average value of 45.7, 33.2, and 15. The building construction sector itself is involved in road and bridge infrastructure, while clean water gas electricity focuses on infrastructure electricity and drinking water networks as well as the transportation sector are more dominant in building transportation service infrastructure. An increase in investment in infrastructure development is evidenced by an increase in the development budget at an average rate of 500 million each year. The increase in investment was not accompanied by economic growth represented by fluctuations in the Lumajang Regency's PAD in the forecast year. By looking at the regional income output from each strategy, 2 main indicators are applied, namely PAD and infrastructure development budget. For the highest PAD it is held by scenario 1 with a scenario of increasing the PAD target at 75% while for the lowest infrastructure development budget is held by scenario 3. The combination of these two indicators is done by looking at the ratio of each parameter, where the best ratio between potential PADs is achieved with the minimum budget expenditure falling in scenario 3 with an average value at the level of 50% while making scenario 3 the best scenario. Exit scenario 3 as the best scenario, then the input value of this scenario is used as a strategy especially in determining the allocation of financing for infrastructure development in 7 main sectors. The allocation is divided into the agricultural sector 15–17%, the manufacturing industry sector 0.07–0.11%, the gas and water supply sector 2.14– 2.42%, the construction sector the construction sector 60.83–65.36%, the transportation and communication sector 7.26–8.34%, the rental finance sector 2.14–2.42%, and the services sector at 7.24–8.3%.","approach muhammad budi adiputra reski and budi santoso wirjodirjo department of industrial engineering sepuluh nopember institute of technology surabaya, indonesia muhbudiadiputra@gmail.com, wirjodirjo@gmail.com",

Increased service level is more prioritized over inventory cost because the unavailability of spare part can cause high production losses. For example, in spare part 631-000490, service level increase from 61% to 88%, but the consequence is the cost of inventory increased from Rp7,455,546,477 to Rp82,816,400,435, this is due to an increase in the number of orders and the amount of stock in order to reduce shortage. Practical implications with the existence of this study can improve service level. Then spare part already has an ABC classification in SAP system that did not exist before. Stock out is decreasing, this can be seen from the higher service level. Losses due to engine breakdown can be reduce so that the loss of production can be reduce as well. The limitation of this study is this study does not take into account the age of equipment and also period of major maintenance. Therefore, future research can take into account the age of equipment and consider the period of major maintenance that company has been scheduled every year.","imran and iwan vanany departement of industrial and system engineering institut teknologi sepuluh nopember surabaya, indonesia imranst22@gmail.com, vanany@ie.its.ac.id",

The two objective functions considered in the mathematical model formulation of maintenance strategy problem are: (a) minimize the maintenance cost (Z1) and (b) minimize the downtime (Z2) after that calculate the production. This Linear programming model has been solved using LINGO solver. The model-1, with objective function-1 and 8 constraints was solved, optimal solution is recorded. For model- 2, objective function-2 with 8 constraints has been solved to get optimal solution at stage-2. Production capacity has been counted based on model-1 and model-2 result. This final solution was validated by comparing with the observed values of the company for 3 years. This validated model is useful for the company to derive suitable maintenance strategy and production plans. Companies can choose the maintenance strategy that will be applied by knowing the consequences of each strategy decision chosen. The detail of results are: a. To get optimum maintenance costs and optimum maintenance, the composition of the maintenance strategy used is 86% downtime preventive maintenance, 14% planned maintenance and 0% unplanned maintenance from total downtime maintenance. b. From the results of modelling the two objective functions, the results are better than the budget and actual. There is a potential maintenance cost savings of 5.92% against the budget or 21.52% of the actual costs, while for downtime there is a decrease in downtime by 20.00% against the budget or 25.38% of the actual maintenance downtime. c. There is a potential increase in physical availability of dozers by 6.53% against the budget and 12.53% to the actual, while for the optimization of production planning there is a potential increase in Dozer production capacity by 7.68% to the budget and 14.56% to the actual. d. The results of the sensitivity analysis show that the parameters whose changes are sensitive to the objective function and decision variables are budget manhours and actual manpower. The greater the value of the budget manhours, the maintenance cost will go down, and the decision variable X1 (Preventive maintenance) is greater than X2 (Plan maintenance). The critical point is -19%. As for the actual manpower parameters, the greater the actual value of the manpower, the maintenance cost will increase, and the decision variable X1 (Preventive maintenance) is greater than X2 (Plan maintenance).

Instead, the study revealed that there is a need to help neglected pregnant women found in Surabaya. The analysis has identified factors that influence the estimated total annual cost for supporting neglected pregnant and puerperal women. The cost simulation found that the minimum required budget is exceeding the allocated budget from the national government. As now Surabaya City Health Office has no record at all about the neglected pregnant women found in Surabaya, there is a need to develop a MIS to record every single information from various resources. The proposed system would be able to capture accurate data and remaining balance of the budget, as the number of neglected pregnant women is predicted to be stochastic. This MIS development is recommended as the future work of this study.","maria anityasari department of industrial and system engineering sepuluh november institute of technology surabaya, indonesia maria@ie.its.ac.id",
200,P300 And Vigilance Level Of University Student Under Hot  And Humid Condition,"the purpose of our study is to contrast the p300 and vigilance indicator in hot and humid condition. sixteen participants performed this experiment. the participants are university students with nationality japanese (eight participants) and indonesia (eight participants). indonesia participants conducted four experimental conditions: standing position and natural condition (without air conditioning and fan), standing position and used a fan, standing position and used air conditioning, and sitting position and used air conditioning. japanese participants conducted only one experimental condition (standing position and natural condition (without air conditioning and fan). p300 and vigilance indicators were measured before and after the given task. event-related potential (erp) p300 and psychomotor vigilance task (pvt) were accommodated for p300 and vigilance indicators. according to the measurements, the task performances of the indonesia participants among interaction between the subjects and the contrasting conditions were significantly different in erp p300 latency (p<0.05), erp p300 potential (p<0.05), and mean reaction time of pvt (p<0.05). on standing position and natural conditioning, p300 and pvt were not significantly different by nationality (indonesia and japanese students). results showed that high temperature and humidity in the japan summer season decreased p300 and vigilance, particularly for natural conditions. 1. introduction the summer season (june - september) in japan is hot and humid. in summer 2019, japan meteorology agency (hamamatsu wmo station id:47654 lat 34°42.5'n lon 137°43.1'e) reported 25.6 ± 2.3 °c for average air temperature and 79 ± 5 % for average relative humidity (japan meteorology agency, 2019). the highest temperature was 32.1°c in august 2019. for students who are from indonesia with a comfortable temperature range 20 - 26°c, and relative humidity maximum 60 ± 5% (sni 6390:2011) (the national standardization body of indonesia, 2011), the heat and humidity in japan may be difficult to adapt and keep the performance. still, with the use of cooling systems (fan or air conditioning), it is possible to avoid heat and discomfort. the use of air conditioning in early hours sleep can protect sleep and thermoregulation (okamoto-mizuno 2004). according to the previous studies (roelofsen, 2002; lan et al. 2010) have shown that human performance and productivity shows a significant relationship to thermal condition. investigating the relationship between indoor thermal and human performance needs considering many factors: education, skills, genders, circadian cycle, emotional states, response bias, speed, accuracy, etc. (lan and lian 2009; wickelgren 1977). study on integrating speed and accuracy, lan et al.

201,Retail Pricing Strategy For Supply Chains: Literature  Review And Research Opportunity,"pricing strategy is a method for retailers to compete in the market. the success of the strategy implementation depends on several factors, such as customer behavior, market competition, and retailer formats. suppliers’ existence is also important to consider in assessing the effectiveness of the retail pricing strategy, mainly when the strategy is analyzed from a supply chain perspective. this paper provides a review of the retail pricing strategy for supply chain. the review is focused to three factors that are prominent to retail pricing. they are retail price promotion, retail format, and customer preference. the price promotion strategy is highlighted here because this approach is frequently applied than the other pricing strategies known in literature. the result of this study informs the existing literature about pricing strategy at the retailer level. this study also confirms that there is still limited work in retail pricing strategy, which implements the supply chain point of view. 1. introduction pricing strategy has been considered as an effective way to achieve success for many retailers (kardes et al. 2011). to determine a good pricing strategy, the retailer should understand customer characteristics and behavior. berman et al. (2018) suggest that two factors influence customer shopping decisions. the first is the demographic factor, which includes, for example, gender, age, marriage status, and income. the second one is a lifestyle, which considers culture, social class, and time utilization. however, a customer-based factor is not the only aspect to consider in determining the pricing strategy used. the market competition also impacts pricing as the competitors can influence the customer decision-making process. moreover, the format of retailers can affect the inventory capacity of retailers, where the stock availability also influences the price determination process. in addition, when the issue viewed from a supply chain perspective, the competitive behavior of retailers in determining prices can affect the income of the suppliers. therefore, it is reasonable to state that understanding retail pricing strategy requires a systematic approach. blattberg and neslin as cited in blattberg and briesch (2012), stated that one of the pricing strategies used by retailers to attract customers is promotion. sales promotion defined as an action-focused marketing event that aims to influence customer behavior directly. this approach is found to be adequate to compete with the competitors in the market (huang et al. 2016). one form of promotion that is often applied in practice is a price reduction, where this strategy is also often the first choice of consumers in shopping (smith and sinha 2000; das and kumar 2009). price reduction is also found to be able to increase retailer sales (mcneill 2012). several studies have been investigating the effect of promotion on retailers. however, some of these studies have different conclusions, such as osborne (2018) and arvitrida et al. (2019). osborne (2018) shows that increasing the frequency of promotions does not have a significant impact on sales and revenue. in contrast, arvitrida et al. (2019) find that retailers who offer low depth discounts with high frequencies obtain higher profits and sales compared to retailers who offer higher depth and lower frequency discounts. the difference in conclusions from previous studies implies that a structured study is required to understand this complex issue, where it can be started from a literature study. this paper aims to provide an initial literature review of the pricing strategy at the retailer level. narrative review is conducted in two steps to synthesize information on retailing pricing strategy literature. first, the literature is collected proceedings of the international conference on industrial engineering and operations management sao paulo, brazil, april 5 - 8, 2021 © ieom society international 1870",,"This paper has provided a literature review on retail pricing strategy for supply chain. A research opportunity is also identified by mapping the previous literature. The review considers several factors, which are competition, customer behavior, sales promotion, and retailer format. The types of retailers discussed in this study are stores that sell functional or convenience products, while it also investigates the extent of supply chain point of view implemented in existing studies. This paper has organized the existing literature about pricing strategy at the retailer level. This study also finds that there is not much work that uses supply chain point perspective in the previous research. As discussed in the previous section, enhancing this study can be enriched by extending the aspects that are examined, such as considering joint economic lot sizing topics in retail pricing strategy. However, in general, this study has provided a good initial basis for identifying research opportunity in pricing strategy in supply chains.","niniet indah arvitrida, niken anggraini savitri and rifki jalu pramudita department of industrial and systems engineering institut teknologi sepuluh nopember surabaya, indonesia niniet@ie.its.ac.id",

Based on the number of event identification in HOR Phase 1 conducted assessment with ARP. The assessment was followed by the use of a Pareto diagram which resulted in 2 causal factors and 3 preventive action in HOR Phase 2. Later in the Monte Carlo simulation, this simulation is based on events or incidents that occur historically on the loading and unloading activities in the company. Events generated during the unloading business activities of 6 events. From the incident, this simulation is done by probability and produce two types of distribution, namely Beta and Uniform. Whereas the significance of the probability of occurrence of events with actual events (historically) is expressed as opposed to real (accepted) with actual events on each incident. This research raises new things in the operation of unloading operations, i.e. the use of a MiniCon. Thus, this study still has limitations on the deficiencies in sample data. Upcoming research can be done again if the data has accumulated more.

There are 13 strategies that can be used to eliminate or reduce the emergence of risk agents. The priority for preventive action is to do the training routine for employees with ETD value of 7490. These recommendations can be made to reduce the risk of water supply to reduce unreliable for water supply.","nailul khalid department of technology management institut teknologi sepuluh nopember surabaya, indonesia nailulizzah95@gmail.com iwan vanany department of industrial and system engineering institut teknologi sepuluh nopember surabaya, indonesia vanany@ie.its.ac.id",
204,Spare Part Inventory Management With A Cross-Functional  Perspective,"this paper proposes an approach for spare part management that involves conflict of interests between units in a company. a case study of spare part problem in a cement industry used, which implicates five working units, called user, spare part planning, maintenance planning, procurement of goods and inventory management. the method used in this research is to classify spare parts into four categories by considering maintenance and logistics perspectives, then using system dynamic model to present the complexity in conflict of interest. this research expected to be useful for companies, particularly in managing conflicts in spare part management.",inventory policy,"By applying a periodic review inventory control R, s, S, the user does not need to plan for continuous purchases because the inventory system is able to make purchase orders automatically provided that the parts are still needed by the user. The system will monitor when buying spare parts based on inventory levels that depend also on the use of spare parts in the warehouse. The use of spare parts depends on the budget provided by management, whether it only considers management policies or also considers the value of inventory as well. If considering the value of inventory, it is expected that every budget period given consider the spare parts in the warehouse can be used so that it can reduce the deadstock of spare parts in the warehouse Based on the system dynamic model made, in deciding the number of purchases for each of these parts, it must also take into account the estimated parts that will used in the same period. Whereas in deciding or estimating the amount of spare parts usage in the same period, the budget for each equipment maintenance unit must take into account the budget. Then the budget of each work unit for maintenance of production equipment is given based on management policies related to the budget allocation given in one year to a production plant, then based on the history of the use of the budget and planned maintenance activities that use spare parts in the warehouse. This research is able to represent the dynamics in spare parts management that does not necessarily consider the spare parts classification approach and inventory policy. Nevertheless, other factors can influence management decisions in providing spare parts. The approach uses a system dynamic simulation.","bayu pratama putra, niiniet indah arvitrida and i nyoman pujawan department of industrial and system engineering institut teknologi sepuluh nopember surabaya, indonesia bayu.pratamaputra11@gmail.com, niniet@ie.its.ac.id, pujawan@ie.its.ac.id",
205,Strategic Role Of Procurement Function On Private Hospital,"roemani hospital is one of the private hospitals in the semarang area. roemani hospital procurement activities carried out by the procurement unit. the procurement unit conducts procurement of goods and services to run the roemani hospital business process. the roemani hospital procurement unit works according to the roemani hospital organizing guidelines. however, the performance of the roemani hospital procurement unit is only reactive to demand. the procurement unit does not have a strategic role in running the roemani hospital business processes. therefore, it is necessary to assess the procurement maturity level for the roemani hospital procurement unit. the assessment was carried out to formulate recommendations for improvement in the roemani hospital procurement unit. in this study, the model used is the supply management maturity model. the model has five assessment characteristics, namely procurement planning, organizational structure of purchasing, process organisation, human resources and leadership, and purchasing controlling. based on these five characteristics 56 questions were formulated to conduct the assessment. the assessment results show that the roemani hospital procurement unit is in stage 2 or independent. furthermore, the formulation of recommendations for improvement for the roemani hospital procurement unit was carried out.","procurement, strategic, wrong suppliers","Procurement maturity is a measure of procurement activities included in strategic management decision making. In this study the method used is Supply Management Maturity Model. In the measurement method there are five criteria for measuring the maturity of procurement. These criteria are procurement planning, organizational of purchasing, process organization, human resources and leadership, and purchasing controlling. Procurement planning has four aspects of assessment, i.e. demand planning, pooling planning, environment scan, and innovation planning. On these criteria, the lowest evaluation aspect is innovation planning. In the organizational structure of purchasing criteria there are two aspects of assessment i.e. structure and mandate of purchasing, and strategic integration. Based on these criteria, the lowest evaluation aspect is strategic integration. Process organization has seven aspects of assessment, i.e. sourcing strategy, supplier selection, supplier evaluation, supplier development, purchasing early involvement in development process, early supplier involvement process, and process involvement with other functions. On these criteria, the lowest valuation aspect is early supplier involvement in development process. In the criteria of human resources and leadership there are three aspects of assessment, i.e. job description and competencies, personnel selection and integration, and performance appraisal and career development. Based on these criteria, the lowest evaluation aspects are performance appraisal and career development. In the purchasing controlling there are three aspects of assessment, i.e. controlling system, controlling process and structure, and controlling methods and tools. On these criteria the lowest evaluation aspect is the controlling system. Measurement of maturity level is done by advertising a questionnaire containing 56 questions to the Roemani hospital procurement unit. The measurement results of the maturity level of procurement of Roemani Hospital procurement unit shows that the maturity level of Roemani Hospital procurement unit is in stage 2 (independent). These results mean that the procurement unit does not yet have a strategic role in Roemani Hospital business activities. In this case, the Roemani Hospital procurement unit has not been able to fully integrate the company's strategy in carrying out the procurement function. Roemani Hospital procurement unit is still focused on reducing costs in carrying out their duties. Based on the results of the assessment, recommendations were obtained to improve procurement performance. The recommendations for improvement include carrying out systematic design in innovation, observing provider markets, formulating procurement strategies, designing measurement systems, developing information technology, developing suppliers, and other recommendations such as involving procurement in the decision making process, formulating contract management systems, and making workshop for introduction to the hospital environment. 48.0% 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100% Supportive Current Stage Integrative Passive Independent Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management Sao Paulo, Brazil, April 5 - 8, 2021","hery suliantoro, anantian suryo utomo, naniek utami handayani, nia budi puspitasari, and darminto pujotomo department of industrial engineering, faculty of engineering diponegoro university semarang, indonesia suliantoro_hery@yahoo.com, naniekh@ft.undip.ac.id","References

The problem of food waste must be the responsibility of all of us, not only for service providers such as restaurants or suppliers but also for us consumers who must help protect the environment. Based on the simulation results, from the perspective of reducing food waste, scenario 3 is the most effective scenario in reducing food waste. The highest percentage reduction is achieved by applying the third scenario with a reduction of food waste by 25.10% per day.

211,The Effect Of Financial Ratios And Macroeconomics On  Stock Return In Infrastructure Sector,"the infrastructure sector is one of the sectors in the indonesia stock exchange. at present, the sector is of concern to the public because infrastructure development is increasing as evidenced by an increased budget every year. thus, attracting the desire of the community to invest in the sector. however, stock returns in this sector not only increased but also decreased. this study aims to determine the effect of financial ratios and macroeconomics in the infrastructure sector on stock returns partially and simultaneously. the secondary data testing to determine the effect partially and simultaneously was done using a panel data regression. panel data regression results shows one point debt to equity ratio (der) and earning per share (eps) can reduce stock returns, then one point return on equity (roe) can increase stock returns partially. however, all variables simultaneously have a significant effect on stock returns because of the value of prob (f-statistic) less than 0.05. the conclusion is that six variables significantly influence simultaneously, but only der, roe, and eps have a partially significant effect. that means the macroeconomics in indonesia doesn’t have a significant impact on stock returns in the sector.","stock return, financial ratio","Panel data regression analysis results showed that DER, ROE, and EPS partially have a significant effect on stock return, namely one point of DER ratio can decrease stock return of 7.310828; one point of ROE ratio can increase stock return of 328.7786; and one point of EPS ratio can reduce stock return of 0.122179. However, DER, ROE, EPS, Exchange Rate, Inflation, and Economic Growth simultaneously have a significant effect on stock return because the probability value (F-statistic) < significance value (0.05). Result from this study have important managerial implications. Investors who want to invest in companies of the Infrastructure, Utilities and Transportation sector, it is very necessary to pay attention to the financial ratio, especially DER; ROE; and EPS than the macroeconomic if the macroeconomic does not change drastically. Companies in the sector must also pay attention on financial ratios to stock return. Stock return can increase if the value of DER and EPS should be small and the value of ROE must be high, some of which are debt value should be smaller; net income value should be higher; and weighted average value of outstanding share should be higher. Since it is crucial to find out the effect on financial ratios and macroeconomics on stock return in this sector, it is important to recognize this research have certain limitation. The main limitation of this research is only 13 samples that can be proceed because only 13 samples that passed the classical assumption test.

213,Understanding The Effects Of Satisfaction And Trust On Erepeat Purchase Intention: An Ergonomic Approach,"the internet has changed the customer buying behaviour which impact the traditional store practice but provides great opportunity for online retailers. the number of online shoppers is expanding at a promising growth rate as the result of the increasing of number of e-purchase. however, this is not always followed by the increasing number of repeat e-purchases. there are some researches attempt to get more understanding on factors that influence repeat purchase intention. but, still few of them are focusing on factors such as customer review and emotional design in relation to satisfaction and trust. this study intends to investigate how factors such as satisfaction and trust impact the e-repeat purchase intention. the model is an extension of previous model where variables such as satisfaction and trust are not considered. this research will be analysed from ergonomic perspective particularly related to the emotional design. in this research, data is gathered through online questionnaires. the results from 711 respondents are analysed to build structure of a proposed model. the proposed model is then tested by using confirmatory factor analysis (cfa) method and structural equation model (sem). the result shows that satisfaction and trust have positive impact on the e-repeat purchase intention","satisfaction, trust, e-repeat purchase, mobility","In this section some conclusions are presented based on the finding of the research. First, this research was the extension of previous model which aims to find out whether there are any influences of trust and satisfaction on repeat purchase intention. The result shows that both trust and satisfaction significantly influence the repeat purchase intention. Second, this study is also investigating the effect of OCR on repeat purchase intention by considering trust and satisfaction. The result depicts that OCR has no effect on repeat purchase intention since the t-value does not meet the criteria. From Ergonomics cognitive point of view, it is concluded that there is an effect of emotional design on repeat purchase intention. The test shows that there is an effect of visual appeal on trust and satisfaction which influence the repeat purchases intention. For the future research, it is suggested to assess other factors such as cultural, price, place and certain behaviour that influence the repeat purchase intention on online store.","dyah santhi dewi, adithya sudiarno, ratna sari dewi, and joshua aritonang institut teknologi sepuluh nopember surabaya, indonesia dyah@ie.its.ac.id, adithya.sudiarno@gmail.com, ratna.sari.dewi80@gmail.com, dyahsd@gmail.com",

A case study to demonstrate the applicability of the methods also has been provided. The result indicates that the assessment has definitely many potential benefits for the manager of the focal firm. There are ten attributes (out of 21) that have value of CZSQ more than 0 (zero). It means that the management needs to improve the service to be delivered to the customers. To perform a selection in terms of which attributes have to be enhanced so that customer satisfaction can be achieved, the focal firm may employ CZIPA diagram to discover how the customers perceive the attributes. Notice that not all attributes must be simultaneously improved, because it can decrease the enormous amount of finance spent by the service provider. Only the attributes that belong to the first quadrant (and have value of d less than zero that immediately are needed to be bettered). Recommendations have been given (see Subsection 3.2) for eight attributes located in the first quadrant. The methods, however, are considered uncomplicated to be implemented, relatively simple to interpret, and a low-cost solution. It will potentially become benefits for the service provider since it assures them to gain valuable insights related to which attributes that are recommended to be enhanced based on their importance and performance scores according to the perspective of the customer.","m. mujiya ulkhaq, aditya cahyo, anita rustanti, leoni gobel, mindo dasminar, and excel verlieson wijaya department of industrial engineering diponegoro university semarang, indonesia ulkhaq@live.undip.ac.id",

At the strategic level, planning level and operating level partially tested, stating that Culture is a significant factor influencing education development. This means that the implementation of education and training at the X Training Centre to produce teachers with high competency strategic level, planning level and operating level must be able to create a good culture. 2. At the strategic level, planning level and operating level that are partially tested, states that Capabilities are a significant factor influencing education development. This means that the implementation of education and training at x training centre to produce teachers with high competency strategic level, planning level and operating level must be able to synergize in good capabilities. 3. At the strategic level, planning level and operating level partially tested, stating that facilities are a significant factor influencing education development. This means that the implementation of education and training at the X training centre to produce teachers with high competency at the strategic level, planning level and operating level must improve facilities in the implementation of education and training. 4. At the level of the strategic level, planning level and operating level tested by stating that the Program Establishment factors, Culture, Capabilities, facilities. This means that in the implementation of education and training in the X training centre to produce teachers with high competency, strategic level, planning level and operating level must increase the Program Establishment, Culture, Capabilities, and Facilities. The problem studied in this study is limited, therefore it is suggested for the future researchers to develop more model, for instance by exploring other variables that may affect education development.

219,"Lot-Sizing Single Item Model With Stochastic Demand,  Multiple Suppliers, Backlogging And Quantity Discounts","one of the activities that can be done to control costs in production activities is by optimizing the level of supply and demand. dynamic lot sizing model is one method to get a minimum inventory level which in essence can reach the minimum costs that must be incurred by the company. this model seeks to eliminate the assumption that fixed demand level is calculated the same for each period that is commonly used in the eoq model. this paper considers dynamic lot sizing, stochastic demand, by selecting one supplier, each supplier has quantity discount system and also transportation cost. in this case, backlogs are permitted, and the standard normal loss function used to represent the standardized unit’s number of shortage function. by having an objective function and some constraints where the variables can be integer and biner, then solving using minlp is a good choice for this formulation model, with commercial optimization software. study case performed in manufacturing, and model can help to determine quantity order to purchase, with specific supplier and for each period. the goal to be achieved is to obtain the minimum costs from the purchase cost, order cost, backlogging cost, handling cost and transportation cost.","dynamic lot sizing, stochastic demand","Proposes of this paper is develop a MIP model to decide the stochastic part estimating renewal for various periods consider over amount limits, different suppliers and service levels. The contextual investigation shows the common sense of the model in accomplishing the best fulfilment under different objectives, which are limiting absolute expense and fixing the service level. At the point when a recharging issue isn't unreasonably confounded, for instance with hardly any periods, suppliers and amount price breaks, a MIP model can be effectively explained by scientific programming, for example, LINGO. Nonetheless, when there are numerous periods, a few suppliers and various amount markdown breaks, the difficult will become NP-hard and restrictive computerized.

220,Physiological And Biochemical Measures Of Mental Workload Of  Air Traffic Controllers: A Systematic Literature Review,"air traffic control (atc) is a complex cognitive task. the complexity may cause the workload of air traffic controllers (atcs) to increase. increased workload could degrade operator performance, which further affect safety and functioning of the system. numerous studies in evaluating mental workload in various tasks used physiological and biochemical measures, including studies in atcs. the use of physiological measures in those studies provides unique information of the operator's condition. this systematic review summarizes literatures on the measurement of the mental workload in atcs using physiological and biochemical measures. the conducted systematic search come up with thirty-four studies to include for analysis. physiological measures are categorized into cardiovascular, ocular, brain, respiration, and skin measures. biochemical measures consisted of cortisol and salivary immunoglobulin (siga). the literature review covers various studies either in simulation environment or real working environment, all with different conditions and task scenarios. even though this review specifically focuses on mental workload of atcs, in general, the result of physiological measures still differs between broad studies. the difference might be influenced by the study task loads, difficulty levels, and the participants' characteristics.","air traffic control, mental workload",,"wiediartini, udisubakti ciptomulyono, and ratna sari dewi industrial and systems engineering department institut teknologi sepuluh nopember surabaya, indonesia wiwid@ppns.ac.id, udisubakti@ie.its.ac.id, ratna@ie.its.ac.id",
221,Asymmetric Relationship In Supply Chain: A Conceptual  Framework And Research Opportunities,"the case of power dominance does exist in the asymmetric relationship. thus, an asymmetric relationship is generally explained as a lack of perceived dyadic equality in the partnership, which is caused by large dissimilarities in several aspects. supply chain tactical strategies that translate the strategic planning into details of operational planning have been proven by studies able to improve performance. there are several studies on asymmetric relationship and supply chain tactical strategies. however, no study reveals the link of asymmetric relationships with supply chain tactical strategies. whereas, knowing the link of those will support the decision-making on how asymmetric relationships must be managed to obtain better performance. furthermore, this study attempts to fill the research gap through a comprehensive literature review. a conceptual framework is derived as the essence of the needs of supply chain tactical strategies to improve performance in an asymmetric relationship. the conceptual framework can be a fundamental theory for further research in asymmetric relationships as well as the manager’s guidance for decision- making. eventually, this research will be continued with a case study to test the conceptual framework into real-world and supply chain modeling to implement the supply chain tactical strategies.","strategies, performance","and Research Opportunities There were a number of findings from literature in asymmetric relationships. First, the asymmetric relationship provokes the external uncertainties as exogenous factors (Gupta and Maranas 2003) of strategy decision-making (Cendon and Jarvenpaa 2001). Second, the dependent manufacturers in asymmetric relationships prefer a constructive strategy rather than a deconstructive strategy to achieve better performance (Pujawan et al. 2014). Third, under asymmetric relationships, supply chain tactical strategies are a tool of better performance achievement through a set of strategies such as capacity tightness, safety stock, frozen time fence, rescheduling frequency, and information sharing. The extensive literature review has been used to construct a new conceptual framework that can answer the research question. Thus, the link of exogenous factors that emerge from an asymmetric relationship and supply chain tactical strategies in order to achieve better performance is answered. This study can fill the gap of knowledge in asymmetric relationships and wherein there is a lack of previous research that discusses the detail of supply chain tactical strategy. However, further validations are required to obtain stronger arguments. As follow up of this research, the authors will construct a comprehensive case study to the number of manufacturers to clarify the validity of a conceptual model. Thus, the phenomena of asymmetric relationships, including its exogenous factors and the firm’s supply chain tactical strategies, can be explained in empirical cases. Furthermore, in order to prove the theory through a quantitative method, the authors will utilize the simulation model to obtain the appropriate strategies’ scenarios on performance.","shovella santy alrosjid, i nyoman pujawan, and niniet indah arvitrida department of industrial and system engineering sepuluh nopember institute of technology kampus its sukolilo, surabaya 60111, indonesia santy.shovella@gmail.com, pujawan@gmail.com, arvietrida@gmail.com",

223,The Contribution Of Intellectual Capital On Indonesian Banks’  Risk Management,"banking is one sector that has a high risk in its operations. risk management is an effort to overcome the risks faced. risk management seeks to manage risks to secure firms’ sustainability and to enhance performance. this study focuses on the impact of intellectual capital on indonesian banks’ risk management performance. intellectual capital is knowledge-based capital which is believed to have a strategic role in improving performance. our research sample was 29 banks listed at the indonesian stock exchange. by using the panel data regression technique with the fixed effect model to analyze the data, this study demonstrates that intellectual capital affects risk management. in particular, structural capital and relational capital affect risk management, while human capital cannot predict risk management. 1. introduction risk management has been recently under increasing attention because many firms cannot manage their risks sufficiently that leads to business failures (lechner and gazhert 2017). enterprise risk management (erm) is a risk management model that identifies, evaluates, and controls risks that potentially threaten firms’ survivability and activities. beasley et al. suggest that erm as a new paradigm in managing organizational risks and making decisions (baesley et al. 2005). risk management allocates resources sustainably to increase organizational performance (mohammed and knapkova 2016). in indonesia, banks are required to implement risk management effectively both for banks individually and for banks on a consolidated basis with subsidiary companies. risk management must receive attention in banking operations in indonesia, as stipulated in bank indonesia regulations. this regulation was compiled and issued by bank indonesia as the highest institution in banking regulation in indonesia. sällebrant et al. (2007) propose that increased level of intellectual capital have been associated with risk management performance. intellectual capital is the key to increase firms’ competitive advantage (chen et al. 2005; maji and goswami 2016; hejazi et al. 106). in this respect, knowledge capital is an inimitable asset. firms will continuously develop if they deploy their intellectual capital effectively. a more dynamically and complexly changing environment causes knowledge-based resources to be the main asset to preserve firms’ sustainable advantage (wei and hooi 2009). modified value added intellectual coefficient (mvaic) measures intellectual capital performance (ulum et al. 2014). mvaic itself consists of four components, namely, human capital efficiency, structural capital efficiency, relational capital efficiency, and capital employed efficiency. in particular, risk management positively contributes to firms’ performance with greater intellectual capital (andersen 2008). sällebrant et al. (2007) find that intellectual capital is negatively related to idiosyncratic risk. the relationship implies that intellectual capital helps firms implement risk management that reduces their risks. thus, this research was conducted to determine the effect of intellectual capital on risk management. proceedings of the international conference on industrial engineering and operations management sao paulo, brazil, april 5 - 8, 2021 © ieom society international 2049",,"Intellectual capital positively affects Indonesian banks’ risk management as indicated by the significantly positive effect of Modified Value Added Intellectual Coefficient on Enterprise Risk Management. Also, the components of Modified Value Added Intellectual Coefficient, i.e., Structural Capital Efficiency and Relational Capital Efficiency, positively affect Enterprise Risk Management. The results suggest that intellectual capital contributes to banks’ enhanced risk management implementation. Banks will implement their risk management when they are more aware of risks, and awareness will increase when organizational knowledge improves.","a w s gama department of management mahasaraswati denpasar university indonesia salasa.gm@gmail.com n l p wiagustini, i b p sedana, and i b a purbawangsa department of management udayana university indonesia",

225,"Aircraft Redelivery Project Risk Assessment: A Case Study  In Maintenance, Repair And Overhaul (Mro) Company","in the aircraft redelivery process, mro companies often experience delays in the completion of aircraft maintenance and repair before being handed over to the lessor (aircraft owner). a study was conducted to analyse the risk causes with a systematic risk management approach. the risk assessment study refers to iso 31000, which consists of 4 stages: risk-cause identification, risk-cause classification, risk analysis, and evaluation, and risk treatment identification. root-cause and pareto analysis also used to help to strengthen the analysis and decision making. this study was conducted in one of the mro companies in indonesia. from a study of 7 cases of aircraft redelivery delay in 2001-2017, it was found that the dominant cause of the risk was late in decision making on new findings of aircraft condition, bad data management, bad system planning, availability of materials and workers, and poor quality of maintenance work. after the risk assessment process, it was obtained that 6 risks causes need to be reduced, 3 risks need to be shared/transferred, and 3 risks need to be accepted. 1. introduction the aviation industry applies very high safety standards to ensure every flight is safe. flight safety is very dependent on the aircraft condition. the aircraft condition becomes a particular concern by each airline as the lessee and lessor as the owner of the aircraft when the lease agreement ends. the lessee is obliged to redeliver the aircraft to the lessor in accordance with the redelivery provisions (international air transport association 2017). in this series of redelivery processes, a maintenance, repair, and overhaul (mro) company is appointed to carry out maintenance and repairs of aircraft. one of the important issues that often occurs is the delay in aircraft maintenance and repair completion. this issue has a big impact on mro companies related to extended work time and cost, penalty fees of late handover from the lessor, and disruption of subsequent aircraft maintenance activities. approximately, there are 80% delay occurred in the aircraft redelivery process (lehri 2019). since 2010, there has been a significant increase in the aircraft leasing business, and it is estimated that this number will continue to increase, because of its ability to remove residual value risk, provide alternate financing, increase flexibility in orders, and until recently, enable off-balance-sheet debt (world of leasing yearbook 2018). therefore, an effort is needed to improve these conditions so that the risk of delay in aircraft redelivery can be minimized. all types and sizes of organizations have internal and external factors that influence the achievement of their objectives. the effect of this uncertainty has on an organization's objectives is “risk”. which can be measured by the likelihood and its impact on the organization (wang and hsu 2009). efforts to systematically minimize the impact of risks are called risk management. risk management has long been an important contributor to most types of management and is widely applied in various areas, such as manufacturing, insurance, services, and economics (ritchie and brindley 2007). the study was conducted in one of the mro companies in indonesia. documentation from the 2001-2017 period about aircraft redelivery delay was analysed. in the literature review process, it is known that there are still a few academic types of research that discuss about risk management in the aircraft redelivery process. therefore, this study aims to help the mro company to minimize the risk of aircraft redelivery process by assessing the risks. the scope of this study includes risk assessment which consists of identifying the risk causes, classifying risk causes, analysing and evaluating the risk causes, and risk treatment categorization. pareto analysis and root cause analysis are also used to determine the dominant factors and their causes proceedings of the international conference on industrial engineering and operations management sao paulo, brazil, april 5 - 8, 2021 © ieom society international 2068",,"The principal objective of this study is to identify, classify, analyse, and evaluate risk causes of aircraft redelivery delay help the MRO Company to minimize the risk of aircraft redelivery process by assessing the risks and prepare risk cause treatment categorization. From the results of this study, it was known that risk causes which dominantly happen are late to make the decision about new findings, bad data management, bad system planning, availability of workers and materials, and poor quality of maintenance works. This knowledge can be information for managers in MRO Company, as well as the other researchers. There are a few limitations of the present study, along with many possibilities for future research. This study only applied several steps to form the ISO 31000 risk management framework that is related to risk assessment steps. In order to, gain more comprehensive results, future studies could apply the complete risk management framework of ISO 31000 and also enhance the risk treatment activity. Furthermore, future studies could also analyse the application of integrated risk management framework on lessor company, lessee company, and MRO company to obtain the more comprehensive results from all the process that related to aircraft redelivery process.

227,Development Of A Three-Phase Inventory Management  Model For Perishable Products (Chili) By Considering,"one of the challenges faced by the food industry when managed supplies are perishable products. perishable products are products that have a short lifetime. a short lifetime will make a decrease in value over time. the problem with inventory management for perishable products is how to determine the amount of supply needed to used/stored before the product's life runs out and will achieve profit maximization. in this research, an inventory management model product will make by doing a renewal process. this model has three inventory phases. each phase stores a different type of product, where inventory in the first phase will change to the second phase through a specific process. the renewal process is to change a product in the previous phase and becomes a different product in the next phase. by doing the renewal process, the rest of the product from the previous phase can be used and not wasted. the purpose of doing the renewal process is to extend product lifetime. the problem in this study will perform in several case scenarios that can represent real system conditions. it also can prove that doing the renewal process can provide higher profits.",,"has resulted from numerical experiments with three different levels of product demand. Even though the numerical calculation results without the renewal process have a small lost sales cost, it does not guarantee a significant profit. Table 10. Purchase cost, production cost & renewal process cost. Demand Scenario Purchase , Production & Renewal cost Total Product 1 Product 2 Product 3 Flat SK1-1 IDR 56,149,087 IDR 42,352,784 IDR 19,693,344 IDR 118,195,216 SK1-2 IDR 182,700,388 - - IDR 182,700,388 Trend (increased) SK2-1 IDR 46,118,818 IDR 41,320,149 IDR 6,585,694 IDR 94,024,661 SK2-2 IDR 205,116,475 - - IDR 205,116,475 Fluctuating SK3-1 IDR 61,490,107 IDR 50,924,052 IDR 6,926,368 IDR 119,340,526 SK3-2 IDR 260,395,182 - - IDR 260,395,182 From table 10 can be seen overall, the purchase costs required in the scenario without doing the renewal process are much higher. In the first scenario SK1-2, the total cost required is IDR 182,700,388. When compared with numerical calculations using the renewal process, the total cost required is IDR 118,195,216. By doing the renewal process gives higher profits because when there is a renewal process that can make savings, savings occur because of buying raw materials at low prices and then processed themselves. For example, to make dried chili, fresh chili is needed, which is processing by drying. The price of fresh chili and the cost of this drying process is lowest than buying dried chili directly. Likewise, in scenario two, the demand level is increasing. The total cost required for numerical calculations without renewal is greater IDR 205,116,475. While numerical calculations with the renewal process get a smaller total cost, that is IDR 94,024,661. The same thing happens in the third scenario, where, without doing the renewal process, it requires a higher cost.

229,Coming Together Is A Beginning: A Review Of Business  Incubator And Digital Startup Company,"the growing number of digital start-up companies have a significant impact on the industry and economy globally, rising a question of how these companies commend their businesses out of intriguing ideas. the role of a business incubator in fostering and nurturing digital start-ups is argued to be necessary as business owners start developing the ideas. the role of business incubators in developing digital start-ups becomes a question. how may the guidance program support the digital start-ups in developing and executing ideas? this study endeavors to elaborate on the role of business incubators in developing digital start-up companies using a systematic literature review. we reveal several unique insights from the review; the role of a business incubator is not only limited to the digital start-up companies, but also the ecosystem. therefore, business incubators influence the ‘upstream’ to ‘downstream’ of development of digital start-ups. 1. introduction we have become aware that the world has changed with the growth of digital start-up companies. these companies have breached many things by changing the map of competition in various industries; for instance, facebook, uber, whatsapp, twitter, with novel ideas to make users feel easier for their life. in indonesia, we are also observing almost the same phenomenon; there are gojek, traveloka, tokopedia, bukalapak, and ovo, which have become unicorn digital start-up companies, i.e., start-up companies with a valuation of more than $ 1 billion. the achievement was obtained in a relatively short time, under ten years since the establishment of these companies. in terms of impact, with a large number of users, each of these start-ups “disrupts” conventional businesses. a similar question remains; how gojek disturbs the transportation business, how tokopedia and bukalapak disturb the conventional market and small businesses, how traveloka disturbs the travel business, and how ovo disturbs wallet and payment mechanism. these so-called revolutions have become pro and contra for many parties, ranging from businesspeople, users, to regulators. furthermore, there is an interesting issue that can be explored, when these digital start-up companies start ideas and seek for potential users, they are faced with the choice to develop their company self-taught or learning from a business incubator. by learning from the business incubator, of course, it is expected to increase their knowledge until the digital start-up companies are finally ready to plunge into their operating industries. from the business incubator side, are they ready to provide the right experience or guiding program for the digital start-up business makers? it might be that the guiding program has played an essential role in developing the digital start-up company’s plans to develop ideas and continuous improvements to “hit” other industries. in indonesia, the number of business incubators is increasing from 2009 until now. examples of the business incubators (and accelerator) in indonesia are kejora ventures, indigo creative nation, gnb accelerator, kolaborasi. based on the described phenomenon, how is the relationship between business incubators and digital start-up companies may promote beneficial conditions? in other words, what are the roles of business incubators? this research identifies the role of business incubators in fostering digital start-ups. we argue that the roles have a significant impact on the start-ups so that they can take advantage of the guidance program provided by the business incubators. we focus on systematically exploring previous studies to examine the literature. the systematic literature review (slr) has been used to provide an analytical overview of the current knowledge and examine the research theme under study (de araújo et al. 2017; arviansyah et al. 2011). the slr is acknowledged in the academic community to offer an proceedings of the international conference on industrial engineering and operations management sao paulo, brazil, april 5 - 8, 2021 © ieom society international 2107",,,"averyadi setiawan and arviansyah faculty of economics and business universitas indonesia jakarta, indonesia averyadi.setiawan@ui.ac.id, arviansyah@ui.ac.id",

231,Decision-Making Behavior Of Traditional Retail In  Distribution System: A Conceptual Framework,"the current distribution system is highlighting supply chain resilience concerns in the business competition. related to it, the indonesian government prioritized in retail data collection and management of retail distribution systems (traditional and modern) to deal with the business competition. in terms of supply network resilience, the aspects of decision-making behavior will have a significant influence. this study aims to build an initial decision-making framework in traditional retails. this research developed a framework using primary data collection from surveys and interviews and secondary data through literature studies and theories directly related to traditional retails behavior. the framework will represent traditional retails decision-making behavior in pricing strategies, action behavior, retail performance, and distribution selection. 1. introduction one of the challenges in indonesia's economic sector is managing supply network resilience for traditional retailers. the configuration of the economic policies of the retail and market sectors states that there are urgent needs in the structure and data collection of the modern and traditional retail, in the absorption of local products, and the improvement of the distribution system. this condition becomes a big concern of the government and business people, especially for traditional retailers. the definition of resilience is the ability of the system to react to unexpected disruptions and restore normal supply network operations (disraelly et al. 2003; christopher and peck 2004). under dynamic conditions, the supply chain network is strongly influenced by conditions inside and outside the system all the time. supply chain resilience studies state that disruption in this concept is an operational part that will affect network resilience (christopher and peck 2004; jüttner et al. 2003; tang 2006; kovács and tatham 2009; zhao et al. 2011). one of the important reasons for measuring supply network resilience is the relationship between network resilience and business competition performance. the concern of the company in the current global competition is the existence of supply chain disruptions, including operational and financial risks (craighead 2007). according to the results of the logistics performance index measurement issued by the world bank in 2018, the highlights problem of the current distribution system concerns over the resilience of the supply chain network to maintain business competition. the problem needs to be concerned about is the distribution system to maintain and improve the performance of traditional retail businesses. asosiasi pengusaha indonesia (apindo), well known indonesian businessman association, states that the distribution of stores or retails in indonesia in 2017 is dominated by traditional retail, which is 82.3%. this data shows that traditional retail is still growing very well in indonesia. the habit of consumers making small purchases makes them always rely on traditional retailers (blanco and fransoo 2013). the dominance of traditional retailers has the potential for weak business competitiveness. hence, supply network resilience becomes a proceedings of the international conference on industrial engineering and operations management sao paulo, brazil, april 5 - 8, 2021 © ieom society international 2129",,"This study produced a framework for traditional retail behavior in decision-making. Traditional retailers have the same selling price strategy through unit-based costs. In the next process, retailing does the learning process for its operational existence by adjusting price changes that occur over time. From these two processes, transactions between retail and consumers occur in action behavior. Business performance is built using business profitability calculations. The final process is the procurement of goods through distributor selection and replenishment policies. This research is limited to the concept of behavior based on an initial survey of several traditional retailers. The use of empirical data, more transactional data, and appropriate advanced methods are expected to explain the impact of traditional retail behavior in distribution network systems.

index preference to i. In this study, each individual has an attribute score on preferences. 
 
From interviews with traditional distributors and retailers, preferences narrow down to trust relationships, services, 
and distributor prices. Of these three preferences, there will be 23 types of traditional retail preferences, so there are 
eight possibilities of preference, as shown in Figure 3. ""Very good"" trust shows personal closeness (such as kinship) 
between distributor and retail, while ""normal"" shows a close relationship limited as a seller (distributor) with a buyer 
(retail) only. ""High service"" services are additional services offered by distributors, such as the arrangement of goods, 
and return service for defective products, whereas for ""normal service"" are services without additional services. In the 
price preferences, there are two types, namely (normal) market prices and below market prices. 
 
Based on data collection from 30 traditional retailers, the tendency of traditional retail behavior is narrowed to three 
types as in Table 2.

There are 59% of traditional retailers (18 out of 30 retailers) have type 1 preferences. This type is a characteristic of 
traditional retailers who have a preference for ""very good"" trust relationships - ""high service"" services - ""normal"" 
prices. Based on the results of surveys and interviews, this character explains that the relationship of trust (with 
distributors) and service has more value than price. According to traditional retailers, this character has an important 
role in building and maintaining their business models while still providing normal prices on the market. Through 
trust, disturbances in the procurement process are easier and faster to overcome. This behavior is then translated in 
the form of a utility function.  
 
It is necessary to calculate the proportional score yi of the individual attributes by the evaluation function, 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖=
𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖−𝑝𝑝𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚
𝑝𝑝𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚−𝑝𝑝𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚, 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖∈[0,1] and pi is the value of the p index preference to i.  From each calculation of yi  then given a weight 
of 𝜔𝜔𝑖𝑖. The formulation is as follows: 
𝐹𝐹= ∑𝑛𝑛
𝑖𝑖=1
(𝜔𝜔𝑖𝑖. 𝑈𝑈𝑖𝑖)|𝑈𝑈𝑖𝑖= 𝑓𝑓(𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖)

Each traditional retail will have different satisfaction because each traditional retail has a different weighting 
preference value. Traditional retailers will decide or choose a distributor based on the highest utility value."
232,A Review Of Respiratory-Based Measurement Methods For  Assessing The Cognitive Workload,"one of the objective measuresof mental workload is through respiratory method. respiration is a physiological process mainly related to the exchange of o2 and co2 from body tissues to the air. the aim of this study is to review respiratory method and mental workload research for developing cognitive workload measurement methods based on a literature study. as acknowledge by authors, there are 28 studies using respiratory approach, with 13 parameters in which the respiratory rate parameter is often used. there are 7 domains and 1 nonspecific domain about the studies. from the literature review, considering its advantages, the respiratory seems to be a promising approach in the study of cognitive workload measurement in particular in indonesia due to its low cost and practical reasons. 1. introduction recently, the characteristics of work in industry and daily activities has shifted from physical activity to mental activities. this change is triggered with the development of industry 4.0, which is characterized by the massive use of internet and cloud system. in addition, the changes also involve cognitive abilities (for example thinking, remembering, and making decisions) in a large extent. the need of cognitive abilities to fulfil the job demand in recent activities raises the issue of cognitive load. the cognitive workload, which is defined as the difference between work demand and worker’ cognitive capacity, (gopher and donchin 1986) has become an important issue in recent years, in relation to the efforts to improve the performance of the systems. the term cognitive workload sometimes interchange with the term of mental workload in some studies. maintaining the optimal cognitive workload will ensure the optimal performance. too low of cognitive workload (i.e., under load) will cause boredom and decreased performance (for example, increasing vigilance decrement). in contrast too high of cognitive worklaod (i.e., overload) will causes errors as well as work accidents. therefore, measuring cognitive workload is very important. measuring cognitive workload should fulfill some criteria. according to o'donnel and eggemeier (1986) cognitive workload measures should sensitive (i.e., can differentiate the level of cognitive workload on the same job), acceptable (i.e., accept by the respondents), diagnosticity (i.e., can distinguish sources of cognitive workload variation and the contribution of each source the total cognitive workload), not intrusive (i.e., does not interfere with the work or activity to be measured or the workload to be measured), , and minimal equipment (i.e., using minimum equipment so that the measuredoes not affect the performance of the respondent). measuring workload can be done subjectively that is through the assessment of employee questionnaires that are measured at the end of the activity, for example rating mental effort scale (rsme, zijlstra and van doorn 1985, widyanti et al. 2013), subjective workload assessment technique or swat (reid and nygren 1988), and nasa task load index or nasa-tlx (hart and staveland 1988). it can be done objectively as well, using a physiology approach such as using heart rate variability or hrv (widyanti et al. 2013), galvanic skin response or gsr (widyanti et al. 2017) and electroencephalograph or eeg (rahma et al. 2020). both subjective and objective method have their own advantages and disadvantages. proceedings of the international conference on industrial engineering and operations management sao paulo, brazil, april 5 - 8, 2021 © ieom society international 2138",,RR and TV are indicators of respiratory approach that is often used.

234,Analysis Of Supply Chain Performance Based On The  Supply Chain Management Maturity Level In,"transformation in the manufacturing industry followed by the development of globalization, requiring performance improvements along the supply chain. supply chain management is one of competitive strategy to enhance the company’s productivity and profitability. supply chain management maturity models is present to propose the best practices in supply chain management. a basic idea from these models is that increased maturity will improve supply chain performance. this study investigates the relationship between supply chain management maturity and supply chain performance based on the five key supply chain management maturity dimensions consisting of strategy; asset and facility; human resource; information and technology system; and process areas provided in scor model derived from previous literature. they were collected by web-survey from relatively manufacturing industry in various company size. the study results may be limited by the size of collected sample. the research framework and hypothesis in this study were tested using partial least square approach. the results specifically highlight the contribution implementation of supply chain management maturity which can improve supply chain operational and supply chain organizational performance. this study provides useful planning information in the manufacturing industry.",,"and Implications This paper has provided empirical study that identifies two SCM maturity and describes the relationship among SCM maturity, operational performance and organizational performance within the context of manufacturing industries. It sought answers to the main research questions that is how the level of maturity of SCM practices in the manufacturing industry is. The current implementation of supply chain management concepts in manufacturing companies is shown in the results of a survey that shows the level of maturity of each application of supply chain best practice. From 57 results of the questionnaire that have been processed show that the average level of implementation of the implementation of supply chain best practice is in the development stage and there needs to be some improvement in some practices. For companies engaged in the manufacturing industry, attention should be directed more towards the factors of increasing cooperation and collaboration both in terms of internal and external with suppliers and customers, as well as increasing the use of information technology at all sizes of the industrial scale. Data for the study were collected was tested using partial least squares method, which is a structural equation modelling approach. Based on previous literature, SCM maturity were grouped in five dimensions: strategy, asset and facility, human resources, ICT, and SCOR process. The results indicate that five factors of SCM maturity dimension have direct positive and significant impact on operational performance and also organizational performance. In contrast, the relationship between the two performance-constructs was found direct positive effect but not significant effect on organizational performance. The present study has some limitations, the most serious limitation of this study was its small sample used in this research. Data is collected from one respondent in an organization that might be a cause for response bias. The next research is expected to be able to increase the number of samples so that the indicators have good validity and reliability and can provide a better picture tangible to the objectives and issues in research. It is hoped that future research can provide input on how to evaluate the maturity level of supply chain management practices in the form of a framework design that has been adapted to the current condition of manufacturing companies in Indonesia, so that it can be used as an appropriate","manufacturing industry niken trisnawati and i nyoman pujawan department of industrial and system engineering institut teknologi sepuluh nopember surabaya, indonesia nikent2@gmail.com",

This is possible due to factors outside of loyalty itself, such as forced situations that cause customers to buy products in the company because no other company sells similar products or customers buy products on a need basis.","aditya sastra and imam baihaqi department of industrial and system engineering institut teknologi sepuluh nopember surabaya, indonesia adithelits@gmail.com, ibaihaqi@mb.its.ac.id",
236,Production And Distribution Model In Cement Industry To  Minimize Supply Chain Costs,"this study aims to develop a distribution optimization model for bulk and package products of cement industry from cement plant until the store customers in java and bali market regions area. in distribution model, 2 cement plants, 5 packing plants, 6 virtual distribution centers, and 128 market areas are included. the transportation mode types are ships and trucks. linear programming will be used to develop proposed distribution optimization model. the main objective of proposed model is to minimize supply chain costs of production and distribution system in this case study. the improvement recommendation also will be declared to reduce supply chain costs from plant until customers. the implication practices of this study is the supply chain manager could plan and manage the production and distribution of bags and bulks cement product from cement plant until customers that has minimizing supply chain costs. as for the potential reduction in supply chain costs, it can save up to rp49.6 billion if existing allocation compared to optimal allocation and also recommendation to stop operation of packing plant due to low production utility.","distribution system, cement industri","This study has identified cost types in production and distribution model for cement industry. The most affecting decision variable in optimization models making to reduce supply chain cost is the volume of cement that is delivered from the cement plant to the packing plant. Meanwhile, the most affecting constraint is the transshipment balance. The optimization model produced two results. First is supply chain costs reduction from the existing condition allocation. Second is recommendation to stop operation of packing plant due to low production utility. Therefore, there will be supply chain costs decreasing and production utilities increasing at certain facilities. There is also a change on bag and bulk cement volume allocation from supply facilities to marketing districts. The limitations of this study that this study does not consider lead time, terrain difficulties, and truck availability. Lead time is not used in this study because it tends to be relatively fixed. Terrain difficulties is not used in this study because cannot be controlled by the company. Therefore, it is very possible to include them at future research.","muhammad reza nooranda and iwan vanany department of industrial engineering institut teknologi sepuluh nopember surabaya, indonesia noorandareza@gmail.com, vanany@ie.its.ac.id",

241,Driver Sleep Detection And Alarming System,"drowsiness appears in situations of stress and fatigue unexpectedly and inconveniently. it may be produced by sleep disorders, certain types of medications, and even boredom because of driving for an extended period. the sleeping sensation reduces the level of vigilante, producing dangerous situations and increases the probability of an accident occurring. those in the prime of their lives are particularly vulnerable, with road injuries the leading cause of death among those 15-29 years old. the results in terms of damage, injury, and death can be only as permanent. drivers who are tired and sleepy have delayed reactions and make bad decisions. this study intends to develop a device or a system that will help drivers in minimizing road accidents. the review uses the concept of the human-computer interaction and usability test as it follows the maximization of the ease, efficiency, and safety of the product and also to have well-designed software that has a sizeable impact on learning time, performance speed, error rates, and personal satisfaction.","drowsiness, driver, communities","The analysis and design of driver drowsiness detection and alert system are presented. The proposed system is used to avoid various road accidents caused by drowsy driving. At the end of the study, the researchers have attained the main objective which is the prevention of road accidents caused by drowsy driving. It is attained by supporting the specific objective, the researchers were able to develop a device that will help the drivers to stay awake and alert while driving through the use vibrating device. Considered the facts mentioned in Discussion in V Section it is concluded that the hybrid method that the researchers proposed for drowsiness detection is more suitable than the detection techniques which consider only one category of measurements such as physiological, behavioral, or vehicle-based methods As a recommendation for this device, the researchers recommend improving the system by: • Providing LED to display the heart rate of the driver because when we are falling asleep or feeling drowsy our heart rate changes, it will go down and the sound alert will enter. • Sound alert that is attached to the device to notify the drivers when their heart rate is dramatically changing due to drowsiness or sleepiness. • Changing the materials in manufacturing this device materials that can handle any situation for example using rubber as the case of the device so that when the drivers accidentally hit it with another object and create the impact it will not break.

Difference in the simulation results of the proposed river crossing alternatives suggests that the models can adequately forecast the travel demand between zones. The ANOVA analysis reveals statistical evidence of differences in travel time when a new crossing structure is incorporated to the existing road network. However, a post-hoc analysis reveals that only in the case of the bridge- base model the travel time reduction is significant, whilst the ferry-based proposal does not.","oscar jara, carlos hernández instituto de ingeniería industrial y sistemas universidad austral de chile valdivia, chile oscar.jara@uach.cl, carlos.hernandez@uach.cl",

To incorporate the preferences of buyers for specific districts, the zoning proved to be a useful tool to compare and weight the sale price of the square meter across the city. The definition of a wide number of attributes to characterize the listed properties make possible to build prediction models based on different criteria. For instance, both regression and correlation analysis can be used to decide whether to include or exclude certain attributes or independent variables that are not statistically significant. The availability of separated dataset for training and testing and for validation make possible to determine if the models can predict adequately when a set of unknown data is used. The application of cross-validation technique helps eliminate the bias caused by an unfortunate partition and therefore, it helps reduce the uncertainty of the result by means of performing multiple iterations. Finally, the resulting error measures from the validation dataset suggest that prediction models based on artificial neural networks can be a useful tool to help estimate the sale price of a property using an objective criterion based on multiple attributes.","ingrid rosales, carlos hernández instituto de ingeniería industrial y sistemas universidad austral de chile valdivia, chile ic.rosalesgomez@gmail.com, carlos.hernandez@uach.cl",

246,Development Of Rapid Macroscopic Traffic Simulation  Models,"this research presents a simplified methodology to develop rapid macroscopic traffic simulation models that can be used study reduced areas or districts with high traffic congestion. in contrast to the classical macroscopic approaches that require large amounts of data and a large-scale implementation model, the proposed approach focusses on a manageable area instead to trying to cover the entire road network of a city. for the purposes of the investigation, the subject of study is an area of high demand with access to a bridge that connect two populated districts of valdivia, chile. two virtual models were constructed, calibrated, and validated. the base model representing the actual situation and a second one with a double bridge to connect the districts. simulation results revealed a significant difference in the rate of use of the bridge`s lanes in both directions during the peak hours. while the base model showed a use rate close 76% and 73% in each direction of the bridge, the double bridge model showed a use rate close to 38% in both directions. in conclusion, simulation results suggests that the proposed simplified methodology might be to be a useful tool for developing reliable models that produce consistent results.","multimodal, od matrix","Base model simulation results suggest that by means applying the proposed simplified methodology there is consistency between the volume flow generated by the model and the flow observed in-situ. Although necessary and helpful, updating the OD matrices may not be completely accurate as it does not consider the infrastructure projects that were built after the creation of the original OD matrices. Even though it is based on the classical models, the main advantage of the proposed simplified methodology is the reduced effort (data, measurements, construction, calibration, validation) needed to construct virtual models thanks to the focus on rather reduces areas instead of the whole road network. Finally, the comparison between the simulation results of the base model and the double bridge model are consistent with the expected result, which is a reduction close to 50% in the traffic flow. The results suggest that the proposed simplified methodology might be a useful tool to analyze the impact of alterations to the existing by means of developing rapid simulation models focused on small areas of interest.

247,A Comparative Study Of Hospital Catering Production  System Between Thailand And Denmark,"in thai public hospitals, a hospital meal demand did not come from an inward admitted patient's desire but medically indicated by a medical professional. moreover, it will be known only after a daily bedside diagnosis of each patient. a hospital self-operated kitchen system in thai hospitals uses static production planning by predetermined production quantity in advance of actual production for a week. unlike in the new danish public hospitals, patients can select their meals listed on a menu based on their health condition. danish hospitals' centralized kitchen acted as a production hub providing postponed food to its network hospital within its area. therefore, this paper explores how public hospitals in these two different countries manage and control their catering production systems. two public hospitals in thailand and one public hospital in denmark are select as a case study. with the exploratory research approach, a result not only explored a detail of its supply chain and operations, including inbound operations, production, and outbound operations from the selected case study hospitals in both countries. but it also reflects a different principle on planning hospital catering system between these two countries.","hospital catering, production, medicines","This paper explores and compares a catering production system between a public hospital in Thailand and Denmark. Inbound operations from purchasing raw materials, production systems, and outbound operations from the central kitchen to the bedside of a patient were explored. Firstly, we found that Thailand and Denmark have a different nature in its healthcare system, Thai people have direct access to a hospital even with a common flu symptom. This is because, in the Thai healthcare system, not all citizens have an individual general practitioner assigned to them as in Denmark, where the first point of contact with the health care system – unless it is an emergency – is the citizen's general practitioners. The general practitioner can then decide to have the patient admitted to the hospital. Outside of the normal hours of work for the general practitioner, Danish citizens need to call the emergency unit ahead of arriving at the hospital. Based on the conversation, a medical professional will determine if the person can visit the emergency unit or whether they are advised to wait until the next day to see their own general practitioner (Ministry of Health, 2019) Thai hospitals are therefore faced with more complicated demands, including for hospital meal, as it is more difficult to predict how many will show up at the hospital while in Denmark, the general practitioner – or the medical professional at the emergency hotline - plays a significant role in managing an inflow of patients by screening and transferring to a hospital as a planned demand. Secondly, this paper found a different demand nature for hospital meals between the two countries. In Thailand, patients cannot select their meals but are assigned by a doctor and medical professionals. The demand is said to be a derived demand, not a direct demand like in Denmark. The orders received in the kitchen are the real demand from patients right from the hospital's offers. Hasachoo and Masuchun (2017) found that a derived demand caused difficulty in production scheduling called schedule nervousness, which is a situation when an actual demand differs from a planned schedule. This causes difficulties for Thai hospitals to minimize the inventory while making sure that all patients will have their food served on time. Thirdly, both countries are facing the same challenges from demand uncertainty, which is different from manufacturing industries. The Thai hospital system is coping by predetermining its production in advance of actual production for weeks while the Danish hospital consolidates a demand from patients every fifteen-minutes before deciding on production quantity using postponed input from a central kitchen. These two strategies are also known as static and dynamic uncertainty strategies, which were proposed by Bookbinder and Tan (1988). Other than a discussion under a production perspective, this research found a different role of doctors in the hospital catering systems. In Thailand, it is required that admitted patients' food must be assigned by a doctor together with medical professionals. On the other hand, in Denmark, the doctor will only interfere with the patient's choice of the menu if the patient has encountered a very special medical requirement not known at the time of admittance when it would have been entered into the digital journal. Because of such a requirement in a Thai hospital, this paper found Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management Sao Paulo, Brazil, April 5 - 8, 2021","narat hasachoo and pornwasin sirisawat business excellence and logistics research centre, school of management, mae fah luang university, thailand narat.has@mfu.ac.th, pornwasin.sir@mfu.ac.th torben jessen president emeritus, silkeborg business college silkeborg, denmark torben.jessen@outlook.com","References

248,The Exploration And Investigation Of Logistics Processes And  Barriers For Medical Supplies Department:,"in the present, logistics management becomes an important strategy for reducing costs and improving the efficiency of all processes in many industries. the healthcare industry is one of the industries that applied logistics concept to improve their processes to meet with the standard and requirement of the organization but the implementing of logistics management in healthcare industry still faced with many barriers which make the applying of logistics concept difficult in the practical. therefore, the medical supplies department in thai public hospital was selected to be the case study in this research. the main aims of this research focus on the exploration and investigation of all logistics processes and barriers in the medical supplies department of thai public hospital which comprise inbound processes, operations, and outbound processes. the unstructured questionnaire was used to collect the data from the experts in the hospital and the workers of the medical supplies department. the results of this research, the logistics processes, and the barriers are found. and the finding proposed in this research can help the researchers, top management, practitioner, and other related people understand more about the situation of the logistics processes and the main barriers which happened in the case study. the result can be the guideline for further research of other departments in the hospital and other related industries.","logistics process, logistics barriers, public hospital","This research aims to explore and investigate the logistics processes and barriers of the medical supplies department of Thai public hospital and the ABC hospital has been selected to be the case study. The results of this research found that in the logistics processes of the medical supplies department, there are three main processes include inbound processes, operations, and outbound processes. The inbound processes will be started when the vendor received the order from the medical supplies department until the hospital receive the products from the vendors which the locations and the lead time of delivery from each vendor will be difference. For operations, there are four main processes comprise of receiving, storing, picking, and dispatching. It is started when the vendors deliver the products to the hospital. The vendors delivered all products to the medical supplies warehouse then the staff of the warehouse monitored and received them. The products from the receiving process will be transferred to the storage area and wait for the order of the users. After the orders came, the staff picked the products out of their locations and prepared for the dispatch process. For the outbound processes which is the last process of the medical supplies department. The products were ready to dispatch to the users which are out-patient department (OPD), in-patient department (IPD), operating room (OR), emergency room (ER), etc. Even the logistics management can improve the efficiency of the medical supplies department of the case study but there are some barriers for logistics management concept implementation such as lack of expertise in logistics management in the medical supplies department, lack of sharing information in the hospital there are long processes of documentation, the uncertainty of the demand from users, lot sizing of ordering process unstable, etc. For future research direction, due to there are some barriers that made the implementation of the logistics management concept difficult and cannot operate smoothly. Therefore, it should use the multi-criteria decision-making methods for prioritizing the barriers to support the decision of the top management such as fuzzy AHP, best- worst methods, etc., or finding the solutions for solving these barriers.","a case of thai public hospital pornwasin sirisawat and narat hasachoo business excellence and logistics research centre, logistics and supply chain management program, school of management, mae fah luang university, thailand pornwasin.sir@mfu.ac.th, narat.has@mfu.ac.th",
249,Proposal Of A Salary Structure For Positions At Productos  Caribe S.A.S In Cartagena-Colombia,"the main resource of a company is its human talent, since it is thanks to the cooperation and contribution of employees and the performance of their roles that it is possible to achieve its objectives. among the factors that most influence job satisfaction is the salary, since an employee who feels that he/she receives a fair payment for the activities he/she performs will remain happy with his/her job and with the organization in which he/she works. the personnel of productos caribe s.a.s. is presenting nonconformities related to remunerations because in 1979, the year when they started operations and the salary was established, the management did not take into account the importance of a remuneration that contemplated the specification and description of the positions and the dynamics of the sector in terms of salary for similar jobs. the objective of this research is to propose an equitable remuneration through a salary structure in which it is previously determined whether the salary earned corresponds to the skills and the physical and cognitive components required by each position, considering the external competitiveness and the compensation","job position, income, motivation","The purpose of the study was to propose a compensation for the positions that make up Productos Caribe S.A.S. in order to mitigate the demotivation of its employees. It was necessary to implement the compensation system of points assignment with the purpose of knowing the relevance of the job positions and their relationship with the salary earned in the absence of any previous one. Among the analyzed, it is observed that the description and specification for the production manager, quality control manager and human resources administrator is not proportional to what they actually receive, so their relative values are considerable but are not reflected in a fair and equitable remuneration. With the relative value of each job position, the salary curve was designed to delimit the function that best reflects the behavior of the data obtained by means of a trend line. Those with a score above 770 require an increase of 50% or more. The areas requiring the greatest salary leveling with an increase of at least 35% are production and quality control. With respect to the comparison with the sector to establish how competitive the organization is in terms of salaries, it was found that of the 10 jobs valued, only 5 are in the salary ranges, implying that if Productos Caribe S.A.S. does not consider the situation, it will be difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and maintain an organizational climate that encourages its workers to perform their duties with the best possible attitude.","luis sampayo castellanos, elianeth villarreal sabalza and msc. carlos gualdron industrial engineering program, faculty of engineering universidad tecnológica de bolívar cartagena de indias, colombia luis.sampayo99@gmail.com, elianethvillarrealsabalza@gmail.com, cgualdron@utb.edu.co",
250,Design Of A Strategic Planning For The Company Metalproffice  S.A.S In Cartagena-Colombia,"the following research work proposes the creation and implementation of a strategic planning for the company metal proffice s.a.s. for which a methodology was used that allowed to collect integral information of the company, with the help of tools it was possible to obtain an internal and external diagnosis of the company and thus be able to identify the shortcomings where it should be reinforced. in addition, it was possible to propose the objectives and strategic plans that would commit all the company's stakeholders to consolidate those activities that would provide a better competitive position and a significant improvement in the production areas. finally, certain recommendations are given for the owners of the company so that they can have a long-term vision of the benefits of the project.","strategic planning, business diagnosis, stakeholders","about the internal situation of the company.Based on the strategies that were deduced from the classification of the aspects, the company in relation to its strengths and opportunities needs to improve the space of the facilities to maintain order in the production area, as well as to introduce new machines and generate innovative ideas to attack potential threats from the competition. Encouraging both administrative and operational personnel for the continuous improvement of the company is vital to build a development environment aimed at meeting the objectives. So, the creation of action plans to achieve certain goals becomes an opportunity for management for the company to enter the market considering its current situation. 6. Conclusion In this project, it was sought to implement a strategic direction to the company MetalProffice S.A.S that leads it to success without omitting the objectives proposed by it in different administrative or operational areas. Additionally, the creation of this project contributes significantly to the growth of the company as it provides a fundamental pillar that every company needs to efficiently develop and fulfill production tasks. It is recognized that the market in which the company operates is very competitive and that is why many companies tend to seek innovative alternatives to stand out from the rest. Sometimes it is not enough to offer the best product but also to know the company's way of working to improve internally to optimally face external factors, realizing the processes and integral solutions that there are to offer to customers. The work addressed the situation that the company manifests to understand both internal and external strengths and deficiencies. Its analysis was carried out through strategic evaluation methodologies such as SWOT, Pestel, Five Forces of Michael Porter and through surveys carried out with the owners of the company. Finally, an analysis was carried out on the scenario and the current influence of the company in the market and then applying a strategic direction based on the main needs. The market study and analysis of the Five Forces of Michael Porter, allowed to identify and corroborate that the Colombian market is saturated with competitors that carry out the same activity, however, in the city of Cartagena the advantage of having only two companies was found legally constituted including the one in this research study, that is, despite the large number Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management Sao Paulo, Brazil, April 5 - 8, 2021","msc.carlos gualdrón, adrian de meza and camila fuentes industrial engineering program, faculty of engineering universidad tecnológica de bolívar cartagena de indias, colombia cgualdron@utb.edu.co , adrian.demeza@hotmail.com, camila.fuentes.alcala@gmail.com","References

251,Restoration Of Services In Disrupted Interdependent  Infrastructure Systems,": understanding the fragility induced by multiple interdependencies is one of the major challenges in the design of resilient infrastructures. these rippled failures greatly increase their vulnerability to disruptions along with delays in their restoration efforts. networks feature a bidirectional dependence such that power stations depend on communication nodes for control, and communication nodes depend on power stations for their electricity supply. this research investigates the effects of disruptions on the interdependent infrastructures of electric power and telecommunications networks and performs an empirically based analysis to understand their interdependence and its effects in restoration efforts. the aftermath of extreme events such as hurricanes, earthquakes, and pandemic outbreaks provide a unique opportunity to obtain experimental evidence that the critical infrastructures are indeed interdependent. empirical analysis including granger causality tests are performed to assess interdependency between the networks following the event. after interdependency and its duration are properly assessed, a system dynamics model is proposed to provide insights on how to reduce restoration times by appropriate selection of model parameters.","resilience, decision analysis",,"joshua guevara díaz department of industrial and management engineering universidad ana g. méndez – recinto gurabo jvguevara10@gmail.com josé a. santiváñez department of industrial engineering universidad de ingenieria y tecnologia- utec, lima – perú jsantivanez@utec.edu.pe raúl valerio national autonomous university of honduras raulvalerio@gmail.com lizzette pérez-lespier congdon school of supply chain, business analytics, & info. systems university of north carolina, wilmington perezlespierl@uncw.edu",
252,Applying Microscopic Simulation Models To Improve  Existing Road Transport Infrastructure,"this research analyzes the reorganization of the traffic control devices in the city’s busiest avenue by means of implementing microscopic simulation models. the investigation focused on the development of alternatives to help reduce traffic congestion problems during hours of high demand. initially, a base model to represent the actual situation in valdivia’s downtown is constructed and validated. then a second model including the proposed reorganization of the existing infrastructure is developed. both models are implemented in ptv vissim. simulation results revealed that the proposed modifications help the aggregate time travel by 32,9% and the aggregate delay times for vehicles by 49,5%. in conclusion, the results suggest that virtual models properly calibrated and validated can be used to evaluate and quantify the potential impact of a reorganization of the traffic control devices.","ptv vissim, calibration, traffic congestion","The proposed model containing the installation of an additional bus stop for public transport in the study area, located between the existing ones; the reorganization of the use of bus stops for the stopping of different minibuses lines, and the restriction of the use of some stops by line taxis; and the definition of optimal schedules of green light times and synchronization between traffic control lights – help reduce the traffic congestion, delays, and travel times. Specifically, the improvements proposed would result in reductions of 32.9% in total aggregate travel times and of 49.5% in total aggregate delay times, by vehicles that drive through the study area during the time period that was modelled (5pm to 8pm in workdays, under conditions comparable to those studied and simulated).This research is, thus, one example of the usability and capabilities of microscopic traffic simulation for the analysis of transportation problems, particularly for the modeling and analysis of complex interactions between vehicles of different types and behaviors, and the definition and proposal of alternatives for the improvement of transportation systems. These simulation tools have several more capabilities and uses, which may strengthen the analytical and data-driven definition and backing of public policy initiatives and projects in transportation and road infrastructure.","isaac gutiérrez, carlos hernández instituto de ingeniería industrial y sistemas universidad austral de chile, valdivia, chile isaac.gutierrez@uach.cl, carlos.hernandez@uach.cl",
253,Implementing Macroscopic Simulation Models To Evaluate  Complementary Waterbus Routes,"this work analyzes the impact of incorporating waterbus routes into the existing public transport network by means of implementing macroscopic simulation models. the research is carries out following a classic 4-stages structure: analysis, design, construction, and validation. during the construction, the classical 4-step travel forecast model was applied. initially a base model to represent the actual public transport network of valdivia (chile) is constructed. updated origin-destination matrices along with new measurements taken in-situ were used to calibrate and validate the virtual model. then a second model that includes the proposed waterbus routes is constructed. both models were implemented in ptv visum. simulation results revealed that only a fraction that barely reached a 1.8% of all trips was made through the proposed water bus routes. in conclusion, with an estimated error of 9.3%, the work suggest that the proposed waterbus routes might be a complement to the existing transport network, but they would not be the traveler’s favorite option.",ptv visum,"The simulation results obtained during both calibration and validation of the base model suggest that the model was constructed correctly and that the base model represents the actual system and therefore it can be used to explore alterations to the existing transport network. The simulation results produced by the waterbus route model showed that a fraction of all trips was made through the proposed water bus routes. However, the percentage barely reached a 1.8%. Finally, the selection of key indicators to compare both virtual models revealed that the incorporation of waterbus routes modifies in some extent the distribution of trips in the city.","josefina ávila, carlos hernández instituto de ingeniería industrial y sistemas universidad austral de chile valdivia, chile josefina.avilaf@gmail.com, carlos.hernandez@uach.cl",
254,Development Of A Global Sustainability Index For G8+5  Countries By Using Topsis,"it has been well established that sustainable development is a critical issue worldwide. countries should consider the conservative consumption of available resources while maintaining their desired levels of economic growth. this study aimed to develop a global sustainability index for the group of eight + five (g8+5) countries by using the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (topsis). the index is based on three criteria: the gross domestic product, carbon dioxide emissions, and the world happiness index, which constitute the economic, environmental, and social dimensions, respectively, of sustainability. the results indicate that the topsis has a competitive advantage over other multiple-criteria decision-making techniques. they also reveal the criteria weight sensitivity of the developed index. this suggests that policymakers and researchers should pay special attention to criteria selection and weighting.","topsis, sustainability","This paper presents the TOPSIS as a flexible MCDM tool to develop a sustainability index. Although the developed index was formulated on the basis of only three criteria and 13 alternatives, an unlimited number of criteria and alternatives (countries in this study) can be managed through the TOPSIS. This flexibility gives the TOPSIS a competitive advantage over other MCDM techniques, such as the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), goal programing, interpretive structural modeling (ISM), and the decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL). Other MCDM techniques, such as the VIKOR method and the Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment of Evaluations (PROMETHEE), share the same competitive advantages as the TOPSIS because the criteria and alternatives in these techniques are treated almost similarly during model construction. Such an attribute offers the potential for developing an extended global sustainability index that includes all United Nations (UN) countries. However, the results of the present study indicate that the developed index is very sensitive to criteria weighting. Specifically, the results revealed an extreme difference in the rankings for the United States and China in two of the models: the GDP and CO2 perspectives. This suggests that policymakers and researchers should pay special attention to criteria selection and weighting.","hisham alidrisi department of industrial engineering king abdulaziz university jeddah, saudi arabia hmalidrisi@kau.edu.sa",
255,Machine Learning For Predictive Maintenance,"downtime due to sudden machine failure will cause much loss to the company. to overcome this, companies need to develop suitable maintenance strategy. nowadays, machines in smart manufacturing provide large volume data to monitor machine conditions. big data analytics becomes needed for processing large data, especially for predicting machine failure in industry 4.0. predictive maintenance works better than corrective or preventive maintenance. it can continuously monitor diagnostic and prognostic processes to predict future failures and the equipment's remaining useful life (rul). using real multi-sensor data and machine failure reports in industrial equipment, machine learning models can study data patterns and build failure prediction models based on real-time condition monitoring. the purpose of this study is to construct a diagnostic and prognostic model with tuning optimal machine learning parameters in support vector machine and random forest (rf) for classification of equipment conditions and rul so that company can find out the prediction of future failure times. also, the comparison of machine learning parameters and methods is carried out to determine which model has the highest accuracy. based on each model's accuracy, rf performed better than svm in diagnostic and prognostic models.","machine learning, diagnostic, prognostic","This research proposed a fault diagnostic algorithm based on two algorithms for multi-class classification of normal and abnormal conditions and fault prognostic for RUL classes in predictive maintenance of Motor EPFAN with sensor data. Different machine learning techniques, namely SVM and RF have been used to proposed model scenarios. According to the discussion and result analysis, the proposed diagnostic and prognostic model could predict classes of each model. Each algorithm has good accuracy for the diagnostic and prognostic model. But the highest accuracy, precision, and recall were obtained with random forest. Therefore, RF is a suitable algorithm for Motor EPFAN fault diagnosis and prognostic. Using this proposed model, similar industries can optimize sensor data utilization to make better decision-making for maintenance strategies and predict remaining RUL. Other machine learning techniques and parameter will be explored more to improve the performance of research results in the future.","dwi kusumaningrum, nani kurniati, budi santosa department of industrial and systems engineering sepuluh nopember institute of technology surabaya, 60111, indonesia dwi.19024@mhs.its.ac.id, nanikur@ie.its.ac.id, budi_s@ie.its.ac.id",
256,Enabling Predictive Maintenance Using Machine Learning  In Industrial Machines With Sensor Data,"in line with the advancement of industry 4.0 which provides opportunities for the utilization of sensors and machine learning (ml) technology, make predictive maintenance (pdm) practices much easier. regarding implementing pdm with ml, manufacturers need to provide data that supports the machine learning process. however, the majority of data is unlabeled and still requires manual labeling to support the learning process, which is risky, costly, and labor- intensive. therefore, the current research uses the integration of active learning (al) and semi-supervised learning (ssl) to solve labeling problems and support pdm models with a better level of generalization. first, unlabeled multi- sensor data stored on the main server database and slight labeled data becomes the research sample. second, the al scheme selects the most valuable unlabelled samples, to label and add to the training data set. third, the ssl scheme to optimize the data usage, using the remaining samples to be labeled. finally, based on the augmented training data set, the fault diagnostic model is trained to support the failure class prediction. regarding the selection of the ml algorithm, the result of trained random forest classification (rfc) could predict a fault diagnostic model of approximately 99,85%.",active learning,"In this paper, we develop the concept of active semi-supervised learning (AL and SSL) to support PdM activities, especially for the formation of a fault diagnostic model that is able to recognize machine equipment failure modes. The main contribution of this research is to provide the development of research theories and methods through the integration of AL and SSL. AL learning makes expertise only performs labeling on the most informative samples, which can save on the labeling process and can improve the quality of better training data. Furthermore, from the unlabeled data that is still available, to optimize the extraction of information on the data, SSL learning is carried out, in which the labeling mechanism is carried out automatically by machine annotators without the involvement of expertise anymore. In addition, this study contributes to forming a failure diagnostic model more effectively and efficiently, as well as achieving a more accurate classification performance using only a small amount of labeled data. Thus, the integration of the AL and SSL approaches has advantages when compared to other ML strategies. In this case, with the implementation of the existing case studies, the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method are proven, and the results show that this method can improve the accuracy of the fault diagnostic model by using a small number of labeled samples.","adelina zian andriani department of industrial and systems engineering sepuluh nopember institute of technology surabaya, 60111, indonesia adelina.19024@mhs.its.ac.id nani kurniati and budi santosa department of industrial and systems engineering sepuluh nopember institute of technology surabaya 60111 indonesia nanikur@ie.its.ac.id, budi_s@ie.its.ac.id",

As the perception of quality is subjective, it was necessary to clarify through fuzzy logic implemented by means of a fuzzy logic algorithm. Education, being constantly evolving, influences processes, therefore student satisfaction, so each academic semester has to iterate the improvement in the quality of the educational product and its services. Improving administrative academic processes is not enough, it is necessary to go further, it is very important, the personal attention service, the level of empathy, the infrastructure, the feeling of security, the reliability, that the student perceives, for that reason it was used the ServQual model, to measure these perceptions which is also seen in the Table 1 , Figure 6 and Figure 7, these indicators must be crossed with the accreditation indicators, it was also observed that to implement processes according to the ISO 9001 standard : 2015, to provide a quality service, knowledge must be constantly managed, that is, information must be administered to all personnel involved in the processes and services, with talks and induction workshops. As a suggestion or recommendation, the perceptions survey should be conducted by an autonomous entity of the accreditation area or an external entity that does not belong to the Faculty, and not by the directors of the professional careers, since there is a conflict of interest. Then the perceptions report should be delivered to the dean and the directors of the professional careers to make the respective improvements, currently it is handled internally.","case study: faculty of engineering of a public university santiago domingo, moquillaza henríquez and javier elmer cabrera díaz academic department of computer science- universidad nacional mayor de san marcos av. german amezaga s/n lima 1, lima, perú smoquillazah@unmsm.edu.pe, jcabrerad@unmsm.edu.pe oscar abraham morales da costa academic department of industrial production and management-universidad nacional mayor de san marcos av. german amezaga s/n lima 1, lima, perú oscar.morales@unmsm.edu.pe augusto ernesto bernuy alva postgraduate unit of the faculty of systems engineering and informatics-universidad nacional mayor de san marcos av. german amezaga s/n lima 1, lima, perú abernuya@unmsm.edu.pe",
258,Expansion Of Brick-And-Mortar Retailers To Online  Retailing: A Strategic Application Of The Technology,"the online retailing industry activity has been steadily increasing in the past couple of years, due to the wide product offerings and provides customer convenience. the philippines is part of the asian population with steadily increasing online retailing activity, making the country one of the fastest-growing e-commerce markets in asia. with the increased number of online retailers, different factors can now be determined, as well as an implementation framework for brick-and-mortar retailers' consideration to expand into online retailing. a survey was conducted to measure the perception of philippine-based brick-and-mortar retailers with regard to key factors to expand into online retailing. the research study used the technology acceptance model (tam) framework and structural equation modeling (sem) in determining the significant factors that retailers consider in their expansion into online retailing. cybersecurity, it infrastructure, capital cost, reach, and online retailing industry attractiveness were all found to have a significant effect on retailer's decision to expand into online retailing. a readiness index was formulated from the results of the sem, which in turn aided in developing an implementation framework catered to different levels of readiness.","brick-and-mortar, online retailing","The primary purpose of this research was to determine the factors that Filipino retailers primarily consider for them to expand into online retailing, as well as to help other retailers in their decision when it comes to the expansion. A survey consisting of 55 questions was conducted on 506 retailers, consisting of statements that would verify factors considered by retailers prior to expanding into online retailing. The first objective of the study was to determine the factors that Filipino retailers consider in their decision to expand into online retailing. SEM was utilized to determine the relationship between latent variables, from which the significant factors were determined. Initially, the research was guided by and ventured on the suitability of the Technological Acceptance Model, but it was later found through the SEM results that the said model does not have a significant effect on the decision of retailers to expand online. The second objective of the study was to recommend an implementation framework for online retailing. With the results of the SEM, a readiness index score sheet with the corresponding weights together with a readiness index were formulated in order to verify retailers’ readiness in expanding into online retail. The index was utilized in coming up with an implementation framework which would serve as a guide for Filipino retailers to strategically implement online retailing based on their level of readiness. 5. Recommendation The study acknowledges that as difficulties in gathering data amid the COVID-19 pandemic present themselves, the study was only able to gather substantial responses from micro and small enterprises, with only a miniscule amount of medium enterprises being able to answer the survey. Further studies are recommended where data gathering is much more accessible to gather a substantial number of responses from medium enterprises.","acceptance model in the philippines ma. francine isabel g. caraan, louis michael f. surabia, and marvin i. noroña school of industrial engineering and engineering management mapua university, manila, philippines mfigcaraan@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, lmfsurabia@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, minorona@mapua.edu.ph",
259,Entrepreneurial Intention In Surgical Instrumentation  Students: Study In Colombian Universities,"entrepreneurship plays a significant role in higher education institutions, allowing students to achieve their personal goals. the design and implementation of strategies related to education for entrepreneurship and articulation of these with the universities' substantive functions would support students' entrepreneurship culture, promoting different capacities to face occupational contexts. we developed a questionnaire under the global university entrepreneurial spirit students' survey (guesss). the sample consisted of 224 students belonging to higher education institutions from the surgical instrumentation programs in barranquilla, colombia. the research results showed that the entrepreneurial intention increases in students to the extent that they have an adequate perception of business entrepreneurship and their confidence in managing and exploiting their capacities upon graduating from the academic program.",,"and Recommendations In Colombia, higher education institutions have made an effort to train high-quality professionals. In particular, the profession of surgical instrumentation has positioned itself as a discipline of human resources in health, where the professional acquires competencies that allow them to develop functions in the field of care, research, and social projection. Like many other Colombia professions, surgical instrumentation has undergone the transformation generated by a thirld world country needs and evolving to overcome its challenging scientific and technological issues. This research analyzes the entrepreneurial intention of Surgical Instrumentation students in Barranquilla, Colombia. The results indicate that in the entrepreneurial intention, there are no significant differences between the universities under study and the national average for higher education institutions, showing that there is a great aspiration on the part of the students to become entrepreneurs in both cases. Regarding the students' career intentions and entrepreneurial activity, the results show the degree's career intention as a professional and the career intention after five years of graduation. It is emphasized that once students finish their studies, they want to work in a company, which is aligned with previous editions of the GUESSS Project evidenced in Sieger et al. (2016). According to our study, students would be motivated to work in an SME or a large company, and they would like to start their entrepreneurship. The university has also allowed them to develop skills during the academic training process necessary to be an entrepreneur, which shows the significant contribution that higher education institutions are making in developing and appropriating these skills, essential in the comprehensive training of surgical instrumentation students. Likewise, the determinants of students' entrepreneurial intentions showed that universities are making efforts to promote entrepreneurship courses in their academic programs. However, there are still opportunities to expand entrepreneurship education. It is necessary to offer courses and activities related to entrepreneurship. It was evidenced in the higher education context that the university supports students to promote entrepreneurial endeavors. However, the success stories of entrepreneurs should be strengthened, and complementary entrepreneurship courses should be promoted. In the family context, a favorable environment is an indication of enhancing the entrepreneurship of the students. In the family nucleus and the community, entrepreneurship and family opinion are highly valued in the face of a possible failure to undertake a project; for this reason, the motivation for students to risk building their business must be encouraged. In the socio-cultural context, it was evidenced that students have tried to relate to people immersed in other areas of knowledge to learn from them and understand different visions. Regarding personal motivations, students have confidence and optimism about their future and have significant capacities, aptitudes, and qualities; they listen to others' opinions and consider perseverance to achieve their goals. They find the idea of starting their own business attractive and intend to start it after graduation. However, knowledge of the programs available to support entrepreneurs should be supported. Also, most students are not sure about the state's policies to finance entrepreneurship. They do not know what business incubators do, and they do not know the different programs to support entrepreneurs. Finally, when identifying activities related to entrepreneurship education in surgical instrumentation programs, it is evident that these activities are mostly developed from the curricular plan and voluntary complementary activities. Thus, a better articulation of the entrepreneurship component with the university's mission pillars is necessary.

260,Asset Management Policy For Equipment Replacement,"equipment replacement is an important decision all manufacturing companies must face, motivated by rising operating and maintenance costs or technological advances of assets. although there are methods of analysis that indicate the necessity and the time equipment should be replaced, performance and expense data are required. the studied company has productive equipment to be replaced; however, its data have been insufficient for applying these methods. thus, this study's purpose was to develop an asset management policy, focusing on critical assets replacement, based on iso 55001:2014 requirements, with iso 55002:2018 guidelines and alignment of financial and non-financial functions of iso 55010:2019. therefore, this work undertook a bibliographic review, and a case study has been carried out in a family-run medium-sized company located within the state of são paulo. as a result, this work brings an asset management policy integrated into the organizational planning to guide and ensure the critical assets have the performance assured to deliver value to the company until its replacement. the development of this study has provided a support framework for asset replacement decision-making. moreover, it enabled managers to understand how quality data availability can make the decision process safer and more professional.","asset management, iso 55001:2014, iso 55002:2018","This work emerged from an equipment replacement and technological updating problem that would be strategical for the studied company. However, it could not be concluded due to a lack of operational data. As the work went on, it was clear that the company did not have an established policy on how its equipment was managed or how they were elected to be replaced, and it was the main problem. In addition, data were not reliable to the due replacement analysis. Just as the availability of quality data is a determining factor in decision-making, the success of implementing asset management, through the requirements of ISO 55001:2014, is intrinsically linked to the organizational culture, integration, and dynamic communication between departments. Only with leadership based on the example and visible commitment can asset management and information management be established. Search limitations The research's main limitation was time, as it could not follow the accomplishment of the other standard requirements. Future Research Although the research ends with this work, it is essential to state that consolidation and improvement in the company equipment management policy continue. It will be possible to realize a performance evaluation and a critical analysis when the company develops the other support requirements and effectively adheres to the AM Policy, SAMP, and actions to mitigate the risks. Thus, future studies will be able to monitor and analyze this evolution. Impacts on the Organization AMS's construction integrated with the QMS, SAMP, and asset management policy has initiated a new phase in the studied company in partnership with a consultant, manager, and employees. Moreover, it has provided a support framework for asset replacement decision-making. As it is a family-run company, this work also enabled managers to understand how quality data and organizational tools insertion can make the decision process safer and more professional.

This could not be done without thorough research of how parameters such as the Actiflo wall thickness, stiffener configurations used, optimal stiffener locations as well as identifying local buckling points. The Actiflo was designed in accordance to the volume required per chamber which covers the most important aspect of an Actiflo operation however no structural analysis was done to investigate the number of stiffeners required to resist the internal hydrostatic forces, the type of stiffeners to be used and ideal locations to place stiffeners. This structure was therefore classified as statically indeterminate beam with a VDL (varying distributed load).

The water scarcity in South Africa is caused by a lot of factors including climate change. All provinces are affected including KwaZulu-Natal. Rural KwaZulu-Natal is facing a major problem in water scarcity and a problem in clean water that is safe to drink and irrigate crops (Thisani et al, 2017). The objective of this paper is to develop a solution to address this problem. The solutions thus investigated are of two types were the air is dehumidified and filtrated above ground level using electricity and another were air is dehumidified below ground level, using solar power during the day and battery stored energy at night. The cost of the product is estimated to be less than R10 000.00. The final solution to the problem was the dehumidify below ground level type of atmospheric water generator, that can produce water from water vapor. The atmospheric water generator is able to produce 23 l/day of water, but under unfavorable conditions, that is when temperature is below 15oC combined with a relative humidity ratio of 65% or less, no water is produced. 8.","s. g. siyaya department of mechanical and industrial engineering technology university of johannesburg johannesburg, south africa siyayasg@gmail.com d.v.v. kallon department of mechanical and industrial engineering technology university of johannesburg johannesburg, south africa dkallon@uj.ac.za s.k. thisani department of mechanical and industrial engineering technology university of johannesburg johannesburg, south africa sandisiwe.thisani@gmail.com",

In this case, and according to the results, the student finds in the support and confidence that the teacher can provide, the necessary complement to express their ideas or assimilate in a meaningful way the new knowledge provided. Teamwork, good treatment and trust are immersed within the academic-administrative management of the program's direction, which must provide the necessary infrastructure so that the initiative, creativity, interest in continuous improvement, does not fade or is a particular characteristic of only some courses. The commitment and continuity of the efforts made and being made need a coherent macro environment to achieve an innovative program.

274,Enhanced Service Level Management Process As A Result Of  Best Practices Integration,"this paper proposes to produce a hybrid of best practices in the field of information and communications technologies (ict). the aim is to empower the user to use a combination of multiple ict best practices concurrently, leveraging off the strengths of some best practices to support the weakness of others. this goal would help organisations to solve the challenges faced when they need to get multiple standards of ict best practices simultaneously, resulting in an enhanced integrated process. this paper focuses on the service level agreement (sla) process, following a “best of breed” approach on the four integrated best practices. the main contribution of our research is the enhanced process, which has taken into consideration a combination of multiple ict best practices. by following the steps and using the proposed systematic way for building the new integrated process, the organizations will be able to follow the multiple best practices and pass the standard audit. as a baseline, four best practices have been selected to apply this study, namely information technology infrastructure library (itil) v4 , capability maturity model integration (cmmi) v2, enhanced telecom operations map (etom) v18.5, and control objectives for information and related technologies (cobit) 2019 .","slam, cmmi2, itil4, etom18.5, cobit 2019",,"muhammad anas alghamian network engineering department universitat politècnica de catalunya - barcelonatech. castelldefels, barcelona, spain muhammad.anas.alghamian@upc.edu jesús alcober segura network engineering department universitat politècnica de catalunya - barcelonatech. castelldefels, barcelona, spain jesus.alcober@upc.edu david rincón rivera network engineering department universitat politècnica de catalunya - barcelonatech. castelldefels, barcelona, spain david.rincon@upc.edu",

Organizations can perform a good service if they know what the market wants or needs which always changes during certain times. The second hypothesis is dynamic marketing capability has a positive and significant effect on the satisfaction of the brand (hotel) is verified where the number shows the number 3.589 that implies T-statistics is higher than the T-value 1.96. The last hypothesis is service excellence has a positive and significant effect on the satisfaction of the brand (hotel) is verified with the number 6.482 that implies the T-statistics is higher than the T-value of 1.96.","customer's perspective of hotel industry evo sampetua hariandja faculty of economics and business, university of pelita harapan tangerang, banten 15811, indonesia evo.hariandja@uph.edu stephanie ophelia masman faculty of economics and business, university of pelita harapan tangerang, banten 15811, indonesia opheliamasman@gmail.com tanggor sihombing faculty of economics and business, university of pelita harapan tangerang, banten 15811, indonesia tanggor.sihombing@uph.edu liza handoko faculty of economics and business, university of pelita harapan tangerang, banten 15811, indonesia liza.handoko@uph.edu",
276,The Impact Of User Experience On Adopting Mobile  Banking Applications And Moderating Age.,"according to the brazilian federation of banks-febraban, in 2019, 39.4 billion bank transactions were carried out using smartphones, representing 48% of the total. from january to april 2020 (during the covid-19 pandemic), mobile banking transactions were 22%, making customers who were not used to this channel to be forced to perform the migration. customers who made the optional migration to the mobile banking system already reported problems related to their user experience. with the complete switching of customers to the online format, banks' challenge in offering a satisfactory experience to the user will be even more significant. this challenge is mainly demonstrated by the profile of users who had not yet migrated to the mobile banking system. they are characterized by some kind of aversion to the use of technology, whether due to a lack of knowledge in operationalized, security, or tradition of performing face-to-face service, among others. the national confederation of shopkeepers -cndl found in its survey that 49.7% of the elderly interviewed have a smartphone but do not use any application, and, among those who use it, only 11% do it for bank transactions. thus, this study aimed to investigate the impact of the user experience through resistance to use and the moderating effect of age on the acceptance of mobile banking applications. the user experience involves all the user's perceptions when using a product. on the other hand, age appears as one of the main factors of resistance to the use of mobile banking, being, therefore, an important variable to be measured, given the current discussions regarding ageism, prejudice against age. for this, exploratory research with a quantitative approach was carried out, using structural equations via variance. the study had 7 variables: bt - traditional barrier, bi - image barrier, bu - use barrier, bv - value barrier, br - risk barrier, mbr - resistance to mobile banking and age (biological age and cognitive age), which appears as a moderating variable. in total, 156 replies were obtained, all of which had been used. the results revealed that the user experience explains the adoption of mobile banking by 74.1%. among the factors that most influence resistance to this adoption are the barrier of tradition (32.47%) and the barrier of risk (23.62%) (p-values <0.001). such barriers are related to the attachment proceedings of the international conference on industrial engineering and operations management sao paulo, brazil, april 5 - 8, 2021 © ieom society international 2560",,,"débora teixeira vilarinhos and ari mariano-melo department of production engineering university of brasilia brasilia, cep 70910-900, brazil arimariano@unb, debora.vilarinhos@gmail.com patricio ramírez-correa school of engineering catholic university of the north coquimbo, 1781421, chile patricio.ramirez@ucn.cl maíra rocha santos and marília miranda forte gomes ceam - center for advanced multidisciplinary studies university of brasilia brasilia, cep 70910-900, brazil mairarocha@unb.br, mariliamfg@gmail.com","References

277,Factors That Influence The Intention To Use Food Delivery  Applications In Times Of Pandemic: A Study Using,"the increase in mobile phones and the increase in access to the internet has led to the emergence of new channels of interaction between companies and their customers, such as applications. one of the sectors that most adhered to the use of applications was food. according to a survey conducted by the brazilian association of bars and restaurants -abrasel, the food delivery market moved to r $ 11 billion in brazil in 2018. according to a survey by mobills, in 2020, spending on the main delivery applications for food (rappi, ifood, and eats uber) grew 103% in the first half of 2020. one of the factors that propitiated this growth was the sars-cov2 pandemic that, due to most countries' social isolation measures, caused the search for digital media as one of the few safe options for continuing this business relationship, ensuring business survival and convenience and protection of users. thus, because of the increase in the number of consumers and the entry of new competitors in the sector over the years, it is essential to analyze the variables that affect the success of food delivery applications in brazil in times of pandemic so that companies optimize their efforts and improve the customer experience. this study's general objective was to investigate the factors that influence the intention to use food delivery applications in brazil and suggest improvement initiatives according to the study's most impacting variables. an exploratory quantitative study using structural equations was carried out. the study was an adaptation of the model by venkatesh et al. (2012), previously employed in accepting the mobile internet. the structural model presented in the survey obtained 245 responses and was validated with a rho_a = 0.815 and fc = 0.875, explaining the intention to use food delivery applications in 48.1%. the results revealed that the most impacting factors in the intention to use are the expectation of performance (14.90%), confidence (10.27%), hedonic motivation (7.78%), and price (6.09%). thus, it is suggested that the companies adopt measures and actions proceedings of the international conference on industrial engineering and operations management sao paulo, brazil, april 5 - 8, 2021 © ieom society international 2563",,,"structural equations vinícius de moura dayrell and ari mariano-melo department of production engineering university of brasilia brasilia, cep 70910-900, brazil arimariano@unb, debora.vilarinhos@gmail.com patricio ramírez-correa school of engineering catholic university of the north coquimbo, 1781421, chile patricio.ramirez@ucn.cl maíra rocha santos and marília miranda forte gomes ceam - center for advanced multidisciplinary studies university of brasilia brasilia, cep 70910-900, brazil mairarocha@unb.br, mariliamfg@gmail.com","References

278,E-Learning Hybrid Model,"the use of e-learning in universities has been widely used and proven to be effective in supporting student learning activities. the scope of the e-learning feature differs from one university to another depending on the needs of the university concerned. in some universities e-learning is used in all learning activities from the beginning of study to final semester examination assessments and even thesis examinations, outdoor practice exam assessments also use the e-learning system because the e-learning used will combine all student learning outcomes including results. thesis examination. the problem is found when the thesis examiner lecturer must immediately enter the results of the thesis examination at that time after the thesis test is complete or the lecturer must enter the examination results in the field. in the web-based e-learning system, lecturers have difficulty because web-based e-learning has low mobility in its use, especially during the conditions mentioned above. the purpose of this research is to help lecturers or instructors enter the test results right away using mobile technology. the result of this research is e-learning that combines web-based systems and mobile-based systems or hybrid models","e-learning, web base system",,"inayatulloh information system department school of information system bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia inay@binus.ac.id indra kusumadi hartono information system department school of information system bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia inadrakh@binus.ac.id","References

279,Public Policy And Indonesian Diplomacy For The  Acceleration Of International Goods Terminal Development,"in this study, researchers focused on research on border diplomacy by the indonesian side of malaysia to accelerate the construction of the international goods terminal at the border of entikong, sanggau regency, west kalimantan, which the indonesian ministry of transportation built to regulate and facilitate the flow of foreign goods in the border region. the approach used by researchers in this study uses a qualitative approach, the location chosen as the research location is adjusted to the area where the international goods terminal was built, namely in the entikong subdistrict, sanggau district, considering that in this very strategic border region international economic activities are often carried out but governance and progress in the area are still lagging when compared to neighboring malaysia. in determining the researcher's informant using a purposive technique, the informants in this study were sanggau district head, entikong district head, sanggau cross-border post head, and the malaysian consulate. the results of this study found that in the process of accelerating the construction of the international goods terminal to expedite international economic flows by increasing clear customs related to the export-import of goods through dry port lines or so-called international goods terminals this was done through border diplomacy by the indonesian side through the malindo social institution. public policy on cooperation between sosek malindo and governments in diplomacy related to affirming the legal status of the construction of the international goods terminal is carried out to control the obstacles that arise in the effort to accelerate it.","melissen, duncombe","The Indonesian government's program related to the policy of developing Dry or Land Ports called International goods terminals is the right policy associated with the conditions in the Entikong border region itself indeed requires a container for carrying out export and import trade transactions to Malaysia by the laws and regulations in force in Indonesia. The construction of the International Goods Terminal is also the Indonesian government's response to the backwardness of the West Kalimantan border region, especially Entikong, compared to the border region in Malaysia to improve the people's economy by facilitating access to international trade, which directly also reduces the level of cross-border crime related to illegal trade and increases business opportunities and work for the community so that it does not necessarily only work in the agricultural sector by relying on private land alone. Still, the city can expand creativity in work and knowledge with the International Goods Terminal construction. The effort to accelerate the construction of the International Goods Terminal in Entikong Subdistrict, Sanggau Regency, was carried out because of obstacles, namely the creation of an International Goods Terminal which was deemed not to have a robust legal umbrella-making local investors hesitate to become developers of the International Goods Terminal project. Based on the results of the research, it is known that there are two stages in realizing the legal umbrella for the sosek malindo law to accelerate the construction of the international goods terminal in entikong, namely first through the diplomacy towards Malaysia to agree on the lane's opening and second, namely through sosek malindo and the local government would continue the results of the discussion. Besides, the construction was carried out because of limited access to open cargo traffic lanes in Indonesia and Malaysia. Cooperation between Sosek Malindo and local governments in diplomacy related to affirming the International Goods Terminal construction's legal status was then carried out to control these obstacles. The obstacles that arise are also addressed through rules governing the International Goods Terminal's management and functions and those related to efforts that can accelerate development, such as land expansion or road opening. Diplomacy must also be carried out on Malaysia to open a cargo lane to Malaysia that can be done through the Malindo Indonesian Socio-Economic relationship to Malaysia so that it can hold further discussions on discussions Dry Port (International Freight Terminal) Accelerated Development by Two Stage of Sosek Malindo The Diplomacy Towards Malaysia to Agree on The Lane's Opening.

281,An Ergonomic Design Of Motorized Tricyle In The  Philippines,"motorized tricycles are local form of auto rickshaw in the philippines. these are a common means of public transport in the country that transport in small towns and cities, especially in the rural areas. motorized tricycles are built in a variety of styles, which differ from city to city, and are usually made locally by building a sidecar and affixing it to a motorcycle. passenger tricycles can accommodate from four passengers to as many as six excluding the driver. however, the passengers of tricycles are commonly subjected to awkward postures and uncomfortable environment that can cause discomfort and musculoskeletal disorders. according to philippine statistics authority, there are 4,488,507 registered motorized tricycles in the country. 853,075 of these are operating in national capital region. the increasing number of tricycles are brought about by increasing volume of commuters in the country. this also translated into higher number of passenger complaints on their experience of discomfort and musculoskeletal disorders when riding the tricycle. given these conditions, the paper aims to assess the current design of motorized tricycle in the country, identify factors that affect the discomfort level of passengers in riding the tricycle and come up with an ergonomic design of motorized tricycle that would be a standard blueprint in the philippines. although passenger comfort is a crucial indicator of service quality, existing studies tend to focus only on the design of cabin or vehicle body that takes into account the postural condition of passengers. therefore, the researchers have conducted review of related literature, direct observation, surveys, interview, and use of ergonomic assessment tools in order to examine factually and accurately the passengers’ discomfort level based on numerous factors such as postural condition, environmental condition, road condition and health condition of passengers. statistical analyses such as correlation, stepwise regression technique, and residual analysis were performed in order to determine the factors affecting the discomfort level of passengers. finally, quality function deployment matrix was used to determine customer requirements that will be considered in the ergonomic design of motorized tricycle. key findings in the study revealed that factors that affect the discomfort level of passengers in riding the tricycle are the following: sitting height, hip height, hip breadth, buttock-popliteal length, popliteal height, noise level, heat index, vibration level, and travel duration. the authors were able to come up with an ergonomic design of motorized tricycle that considered all the factors the appeared significant in the study. the researchers applied the principles of anthropometry in the design in order to match the critical dimensions of the tricycle to the body dimensions of passengers.","motorized tricycle, ergonomic design","From the result of the analysis in the data obtained from 300 respondents of the study, the following conclusions were drawn: (1) Using Cornell Musculoskeletal Disorder (CMDQ) questionnaire, it was determined that the passengers experienced pain and discomfort during their ride in motorized tricycle. The most affected body parts of passengers in terms of discomfort when riding the tricycle are: hip/buttocks, lower back, thigh, neck and upper back. This is due to the sedentary posture of passengers when riding and unsuitable cabin dimension of existing tricycle design. It was also validated through Rapid Upper Limb Assessment (RULA) that the sitting posture of passengers using current design of tricycle pose moderate risk for musculoskeletal disorders and must be investigated and changed soon. (2) All major factors and sub-factors considered in the study were statistically treated using statistical analysis. Based on the results, sub-factors that have positive correlation to the discomfort level of passengers are sitting height, hip height, hip breadth, buttock-popliteal depth, popliteal height, noise level, heat index, vibration level, travel duration, speed, weather, traffic, age and BMI, which explains that as the values of these factors Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management Sao Paulo, Brazil, April 5 - 8, 2021","ma. janice j. gumasing and jonas liao school of industrial engineering and engineering management mapua university intramuros, manila, philippines mjjgumasing@mapua.edu.ph, jliao@mymail.mapua.edu.ph","References

282,Assessment Of Ergonomic Risk Factors Affecting The  Musculoskeletal Discomfort Of Daycare Centers Occupants,"daycare is considered as one of the places where children construct their characters and abilities and strengthen them. it is a nursery for the supervision of children between the ages of 2-6 years while parents are at work. since daycare centers are considered as second home for children, it is very important to provide a relaxed and safe environment for both teachers and children. physical preschool environment plays a critical role on children’s cognitive, social, physical and emotional development, it affects children’s comfort, health and long-term well-being. further, children’s physical environments may adversely affect their postures and postural risk. research reveals that many school children sit in workstations that do not suit them properly. schoolchildren who sit for long periods in uncomfortable postures may develop musculoskeletal symptoms that deteriorate with time. yet common assumptions about what is ergonomically proper for adults may not be appropriate for children. considering this situation, this paper aims to assess the ergonomic risk factors of the physical environment of daycare centers that affects the musculoskeletal discomfort of children and teachers. to address this, the researchers conducted surveys on the discomfort scores of children and teachers using the corlett and bishop body map questionnaire. corlett and bishop’s (1976) body part discomfort scale is a subjective symptom survey tool that evaluates the respondent’s direct experience of discomfort at different body parts. a total of 150 respondents were involved in the study comprised of 100 children and 50 teachers. after which, classroom facility design of daycare centers was assessed by obtaining the actual measurements of ergonomic risk factors such as light, noise and temperature level as well as actual measurements of workstations and layout. then, statistical tools were applied to evaluate the relationship of the ergonomic risk factors to the discomfort level of occupants. analysis of variance was used to know the significant difference in the discomfort level between children and teachers as well as significant difference between the measurements of ergonomic risk factors among the 5 daycare centers involved in the study. then to further analyze the true significant factors contributing to discomfort scores of occupants, correlation analysis was employed.",daycare centers,"The results of the study from 150 respondents have revealed that occupants in daycare centers have experienced musculoskeletal discomfort when using the current workstation and facility of daycare centers. Using the Corlett and Bishop body map questionnaire, the highest prevalence of body discomfort for students are buttocks, lower back, upper arms and upper back while for the teachers, highest body discomfort are found on lower back, mid back, thighs, upper arms and shoulder. Results from analysis of variance have proved that discomfort scores of teachers (mean=29.45, std.dev=2.19) are significantly higher than discomfort scores of students (mean=24.1, std.dev=1.86) having p value < 0.001. Results of two-way anova also showed that there is significant difference in discomfort scores of teachers and students based on body part. For shoulders, mid back, lower back and thigh, it was proved that discomfort scores of teachers are significantly higher (p < 0.001) that of students, while for buttocks, discomfort scores of students are significantly higher (p < 0.001) than teachers. The measurements of ergonomic risk factors considered in the study were also gathered from the selected daycare centers located in Bulacan. Measurements of workstation dimension, layout dimensions and work environment were obtained in order to determine their relationship to the discomfort scores of occupants. Using correlation analysis, it was proved that temperature level (r=0.732, p=0.012), seat width (r=-0.619, p=0.016) and table height (r=0.674, p=0.021) have strong positive correlation to the discomfort scores of students while seat height (r=-0.884, p=0.001) has strong negative correlation to discomfort score. On the other hand, results of correlation on teachers’ discomfort revealed that illumination (r=0.694, p=0.018), chalkboard height (r=0.737, p=0.011) and table height (r=0.774, p=0.009) have strong positive correlation to the discomfort scores, while seat height (r=-0.792, p=0.011) has strong negative correlation. We can infer from the analysis that the current design of seat is too low for the students that is why they experience discomfort in their buttocks, lower back and upper back. Similarly, the chalkboard height and table height are too high for teachers that is why they experience discomfort on their upper arms and shoulders while seat height is too low for teachers that is why they experience discomfort in their lower back, mid back and thighs.","in the philippines ma. janice j. gumasing, kayla katriz mae c. antonio and joanna lou c. mata school of industrial engineering and engineering management mapua university intramuros, manila, philippines mjjgumasing@mapua.edu.ph, kkmcantonio@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, jlcmata@mymail.mapua.edu.ph",
283,Predictive Model On The Severity Of Injuries And  Musculoskeletal Disorders Affecting The Restaurant Kitchen,"this paper aims to develop a predictive model on the severity of injuries and musculoskeletal disorders encountered by kitchen workers in the philippines. previous studies have proved that workers in the kitchen area are exposed to musculoskeletal disorders and injuries due to several factors such as poor facility design, exposure to awkward work posture, poor work environment and other tasks-related factors (gumasing and espejo, 2020). review of related literature states that improper design of physical environment such as ventilation, lighting and noise can cause discomfort, annoyance and dissatisfaction (niu, et al., 2011), and improper design of workstation wherein repetitive work activities are performed lead to muscle fatigue and stress (sripaiboonkij & taptakarnporn, 2014). hence, the researchers aim to assess the current condition of the kitchen areas in the restaurant industry in the philippines in order to determine the risk and exposure of the workers to musculoskeletal disorders (msd) and injuries in terms of environmental factors and task-related factors. key findings from the study revealed that workers in the kitchen area experience pain and discomfort in the lower back, thigh, shoulder, upper arm, and lower leg. in addition, result of rapid entire body assessment (reba) proved that risk for upper limb disorders are common in kitchen workers due to their poor working posture and repetitive tasks like cooking, preparing food and cleaning of dining tables. similarly, niosh lifting equation proved that workers are exposed to risk of msd and injuries due to heavy lifting of kitchen equipment and food plates and utensils. risk factors identified in the study were further treated and analyzed using regression analysis. the result revealed that factors such as work posture, lifting posture, temperature and working space significantly affect the risk and exposure of workers to msd; while risk factors such as kitchen layout, production rate, working space, floor type and lighting level significantly affect the risk and exposure of workers to injuries. given these conditions, the researchers recommend to redesign the facilities and workstation for kitchen restaurant.","ergonomic design, kitchen area, restaurant","The findings of the study have proven that workers in restaurant kitchens are exposed to risks of musculoskeletal disorders and injuries. Based on the result of CMDQ, majority of the respondent experience pain in their lower back, shoulders, upper arm and neck. The risk was evident on the scores generated by REBA and NIOSH computed from their body postures while performing tasks. Several risk factors were considered in the study based on review of related literature, direct observation and interview from the people involved in the tasks. The result revealed that factors that affect the severity of injuries and MSD of workers are due to due to awkward working posture, poor lifting posture, poor flooring material, poor illumination level and ventilation level. Given these conditions, the authors suggest to use trolley in bussing the dishes in the kitchen and dining area, use of non-slip shoes for the workers, use of appropriate cleaning agents and compounds for kitchen materials, and installation of additional lighting fixtures and exhaust system in the area.","workers in the philippines ma. janice j. gumasing and kim d. lustañas school of industrial engineering and engineering management mapua university mjjgumasing@mapua.edu.ph, kdlustanas@mymail.mapua.edu.ph",
284,Decision Support System For Cash Direct   Assistance For Victims Of The Covid-19 Outbreak Based On,"the covid-19 outbreak came suddenly and shocked all humans who live on earth because the rate of spread was so fast and resulted in high mortality and an extremely bad economic impact. the economic impact is very big, especially for the poor. therefore, to protect the poor and vulnerable from the impact of the covid-19 pandemic, the government of indonesia has designed several social protection security programs. one of them is the village fund direct cash assistance or “blt” (bantuan langsung tunai -dana desa), which is financial assistance sourced from the village fund and is aimed at poor and vulnerable people who have difficulty fulfilling their daily needs, especially due to the covid-19 outbreak. so far, the process of selecting people who receive assistance has been done manually by considering several criteria that must be met by these community members. because the feasibility assessment process is carried out manually, the process is less effective and less efficient. thus, this research aims to assist the assessment process to determine assistance for the poor by using a decision support system so that the process can be carried out more efficiently and effectively. . the result of the research is a dss model for determining direct cash transfers for the poor.","assistance, dss, covid-19",,"cloud computing inayatulloh information system department school of information system bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia inay@binus.ac.id","References

287,A Mathematical Model For The Optimization Of Timetable  Scheduling Problem Of An Educational Institution,"the need to optimize the use of all types of resources is a necessity in educational institutions as well as in any other type of institution. preparing a course program is a very difficult task considering the resources. usually, it is a waste of time and energy since it is made by traditional methods and by hand. there are some restrictions that must be followed when preparing the course program. in this study, a binary integer programming model is proposed by placing the timetable, lessons on the appropriate day and time periods and taking into account various constraints. the data are taken from ibn-i sina vocational and technical anatolian high school in nizip district of gaziantep, turkey. in the case study, there are 43 lesson hours and 15 classes to be given weekly for high-school level. in the model, it is aimed to assign the number of lessons per week to the days in the most balanced way. the aim of the model is to minimize the number of empty lessons during the day in any classroom in high school timetables during the pandemic period. in the proposed model comparing to the current timetable, the first sessions of the lessons with more than one session are assigned to the first days of the week, and the last sessions to the last days of the week. thus, students are provided with a more flexible education in the last days of the week under pandemic conditions. finally, break time is taken into consideration.",optimization,"The lesson scheduling problem is a difficult optimization problem that is frequently encountered in the literature and tried to be solved by using various methods. Although there are many studies on course scheduling in the literature, the problem has common constraints and objectives, as well as the constraints and objectives of the relevant institution. For this reason, the encountered lesson scheduling problem should be well analyzed and modeled. In the study, the problem is handled step by step and a solution is tried to be obtained with a mathematical approach. Many timetables have been prepared under pandemic conditions, and since there is confusion, an appropriate model has been presented considering the first and the last ones. When the constraint of sequencing is added, it is seen that the suitable solution is not obtained because the size of the model is too large, and it is tried to be made simpler and more understandable. In addition, developing a web-based decision support system can be a subject for future research.

294,Vetconnect: E-Commerce Portal For Veterinary Health Care  Providers And Service Subscriber,"using e-commerce in online buying and selling of products is very convenient since there is no need for physical interaction, and it is also cost efficient for both buyers and sellers. this platform had increased its utilization during the time of pandemic as people prefer to stay home and do transactions virtually. this led the authors to conceptualize a design of an e-commerce system for veterinary healthcare providers and pet owners as the pet care industry is growing. the portal will let the healthcare providers promote their products and services, including the schedules of their clinics. the pet owners or service subscribers, on the other hand, may use the portal to view those veterinary clinics and make transactions like creating an appointment or product purchases. the authors gathered data through survey questionnaires to determine the user requirements and the needs of developing the system. the results of the survey were also used to identify the functionalities of the e-commerce portal such as booking of appointments, live chat, service monitoring, and payment. these functionalities included the wireframes which represent the prototype design of the e-commerce portal.","e-commerce, website","This research is created for both the pet clinic and the pet owners to assist them in their transaction regarding pets. Designing the website application will give a viable platform for pet owners and pet clinics to continually establish relationships in consideration of the pandemic, as well as to assist in enabling services present to animal clinics to be continued. The authors have considered assistive circumstances by preparing questionnaires to point out needs, circumstances, budgetary concerns, and assessment concerning the viability of how effective the website will be for its users. The design of the website application will also cater to what functions are needed in the design to help the authors focus on the website. Majority of the respondent’s results help us to create or innovate the design for both customers and the business owners, that will improve the business for the animal clinic and the easy-to-use website application. The research paper would prove beneficial to readers who would express interest in using the given application, assessing its functionality especially during times of pandemics in which courier-based and online deliveries have proven successful. The importance brought about by website application and deliveries provide a more automotive stance towards consumer behavior due to access and demand, in this case, for products and services offered. Pet owners will benefit greatly due to ease of acquisition, as well as clinics for assistance on orders, services offered, and availability. Opportunities can be brought about by linking in a more independent platform relatable to local settings due to its specific nature, in which assistive care as well as continuous use can be prominent for both animal clinics and business owners. Future research would be ideal for companies, clinics, and business owners; companies who would be willing to link up for budgeting and finding customers/partnerships, clinics who would be willing to integrate application systems, and business owners who would be willing to support and make use of application systems of a similar nature.","daniele de guzman, samuel mirasol, king perez, and grace lorraine intal school of information technology mapua university makati, philippines dsdeguzman@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, srcmirasol@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, kesfperez@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, gldintal@mapua.edu.ph",

296,Shop Buddy   Enhanced Automated Chatbot For Any E-Commerce,"online retail business like shopee, zalora, and lazada are established in a technological environment of mobile applications. thus, all their components are heavily integrated with technology. however, there is one area that needs to be improved which is the after sales or the customer service. the project focuses on designing an enhanced automated chatbot for any e-commerce website. the idea revolves around the thought of having a smoother online shopping experience for both customers and sellers. the proposed automated chatbot shall also be the means to implement a data analytics dashboard for the website administrators to monitor, manipulate and visualize the occurring concerns and issues faced by customers. the chatbot shall lean towards the customers and user’s preferences on the designs, functionality, and product of the project. the researchers proposed the e-commerce customer service chatbot to be named as shop buddy to appeal to the public. the overall project shall provide a better shopping experience for customers and user’s alike as e-commerce is the present, and future of the business industry.","automation, e-commerce, customer service, chatbot","Innovation is almost often the initial process for technology implementations in the business sector. In business and technology, innovation is critical, and since technology offers a range of opportunities to develop a business and its structures, the business can fully leverage the technological advantages offered by technology. All e-Commerce sites have components that are highly technologically incorporated. However, there is one aspect of e-Commerce that has been overlooked: customer service. It is more than evident when using the above applications that the customer service ignores precision and also acts as a vulnerability for the online shopping environment. With this, the researchers want to create a chatbot that can manage customer experience while also presenting information gathered from all of these interactions as valuable data analytics. One of the possibilities is the right of users to ask questions about their issues. Another choice is to use data analytics to decide which of the users' or customers' key issues and grievances should be handled by the company. Customer service is an important part of any company, but it is particularly important in the e- Commerce industry. Since the e-Commerce sector is one of the many and has the most interactions with retailers and consumers, having a dependable customer support team is vital to the success of the company. In order to further strengthen their after-sales transactions with their clients, the project will concentrate on automating the customer service of the established website. The chatbot project of the project will allow to identify the issues and determine the key issue from the user or customer interaction in which a copy of the interaction and likely presentation of dashboards will then alert the host site that demonstrates the comparisons of the issue with other similar instances. Since data analytics is a component of the project's content, the overarching implementation should be planned with the intention of providing a customer service that incorporates data analytics among its primary purposes. The researchers will concentrate on one distinct area when developing the project: The Shop Buddy. This area would represent the essence of the project and would be the subject of the project's advantages and benefits. The Shop Buddy is the automated customer service chatbot connected with any E-commerce website. This chatbot is a predetermined chatbot that features questions and options that the customer can choose from to narrow down their concerns. And lastly, the data analytics features of the project shall be used by the users of the website and shall showcase the data analytics portion of the project.","website with data analytics functionalities sean justine español, romulo fronda jr., mikka rosella villarica, and grace lorraine intal school of information technology mapua university, makati city, philippines sjcespanol@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, rjdfronda@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, mrcvillarica@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, gldintal@mapua.edu.ph",

The implementation of the Production Management Model is very low cost and brings with it improvements in productivity and competitiveness of the company, giving it a place in the tannery market, strengthening itself against its external and internal clients. With this model, the standardization of processes can be achieved, which can be standardized in all small tanneries that seek the same product quality. The inclusion of a system of Good Manufacturing Practices aligns the company to an international quality system which can be certified. At present, small tanneries, in order to continue with their operations, must have environmental management instruments (IGA), where real and potential impacts are recorded; and improvement projects are proposed, which are required by the Ministry of the Environment through the OEFA and by the Ministry of Production through the Directorate of the Environment.

299,Collaborative Health Resources Management Model,"in chile, rural population faces long access times to specialized health services, as these tend to be concentrated in regional capitals. against this background, the present study proposes the establishment of a collaborative health resources management model, based on the practice of sharing hospital resources between medical centers, allowing daily transfers of doctors and medical equipment within a hospital network. the objective is to meet local demand and increase rural accessibility to healthcare, in terms of reducing patient transfers between hospitals and access times. to compare the current and proposed scenarios, an integer optimization model with a network structure is formulated. the case study is focused on urology specialty in zona del reloncaví, a rural area located in southern chile, on which it is concluded that allowing the mobility of hospital resources, specifically doctors and equipment, is optimal, as the average number of patient transfers and the average access time are reduced by 95.6% and 83%, respectively. by applying this model, hospitals are able to stretch their limited capital budgets by jointly purchasing equipment, providing network-wide access to resources needed for expanding healthcare accessibility.","healthcare, logistics, accessibility","This paper reports the results obtained by analyzing the consequences of allowing transfers of doctors and medical equipment within a hospital network. It should be noted that the objectives of the study are met. On one side, it is concluded that the implementation of a CHRMM in the studied health network is feasible. Also, the performance of the proposal is measured, showing, mainly, that it brings benefits by increasing both the level of service offered by the hospitals involved and the spatial accessibility offered to patients, having a major implication in a significant reduction in patients’ transfers. Thus, the implementation of this CHRMM strategy would be positive for the inhabitants who are treated in the selected hospital network and could have a great impact on their daily lives. From the results, it is suggested the active participation of the Government of Chile when addressing the poor spatial accessibility to healthcare that mainly affects rural areas located far away from big cities. The latter could be tackled by injecting resources within the framework of the IHSN Program. By doing so, the resources invested by the Chilean Government would be oriented to the implementation of a new health system according to the new needs of the 21st century, based on a collaborative economy where transfers of doctors and medical equipment are allowed. Besides, it is concluded that it would be beneficial to further develop this scheme. Therefore, the next step would be to develop a prototype applicable to a network of hospitals in the country, in order to analyze, on-site, the benefits expected from this research. The authors recommend analyzing the results of the COVID-19 Vaccination Program in Chile, given that its implementation in regions has been based on the application of a resource management model similar to the one proposed. Finally, in the medium term, a public policy should be developed, linked to an IT program that would allow hospitals to request and offer their own medical equipment, to achieve a higher level of service and, above all, greater spatial accessibility, in terms of reducing socio-territorial inequalities in relation to health services.","janus amaru leonhardt gutierrez department of transport engineering and logistics pontificia universidad católica de chile santiago, chile jaleonhardt@uc.cl macarena paz navarro tabilo department of industrial and systems engineering pontificia universidad católica de chile santiago, chile mznavarro@uc.cl mathias alberto klapp belmar department of industrial and systems engineering department of transport engineering and logistics pontificia universidad católica de chile santiago, chile maklapp@ing.puc.cl",

301,A Reverse Logistics Network For Recycling In Chile: A Case In  Concepción,"currently, pollution and poor recycling are global issues. recycling is a widely used waste-management method throughout the world and contributes to eliminating waste efficiently and reduces the excessive use of natural resources. in this study, an optimized collection system of household recyclable material has been characterized and designed for cities with a low recycling level. to address this task, we propose a mathematical programming model that integrates two decisions, allocation and routing of different varieties of recycled products. first, the distance traveled by each customer and the costs associated with installing smaller collection centers are minimized. subsequently, to minimize recyclable material transport, a route planning problem is solved by collecting from centers of greater capacity rather than from small centers, according to the traveling salesman problem. to illustrate our approach's usefulness, a numerical example based on the case of chile's southern city is considered. the results suggest that the developed model is a practical tool for decision-makers in making tactical and operational decisions to reduce recycling costs.",recycling logistics,"Although pollution has multiple causes, there are many opportunities for improvement in the field of recycling, both individually and collectively. In this study, research was carried out with an approach aimed at the supply chain of recyclable material collection for cities with a low recycling level. Thus, it was possible to characterize an optimized system for collecting household recyclable material, specifically in the city of Concepción, Chile. The model allows visualizing the economic flow of the costs related to the inverse logistics process. This enables the management system to predict the costs of installing of initial recycling centers and the transport of recyclable material. Thus, the results suggest that the cost of installing an initial recycling center is a more important factor than Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management Sao Paulo, Brazil, April 5 - 8, 2021","sergio aliaga, lorena pradenas and carlos contreras-bolton departamento de ingeniería industrial universidad de concepción concepción 4070409, chile saliaga@udec.cl, lpradena@udec.cl, carlos.contreras.b@udec.cl","References

305,Towards Understanding The Impact Of Industry 4.0  Technologies On Operational Performance: An Empirical,"the fourth industrial revolution (4ir - industry 4.0) is an emerging and revolutionary step transforming the overall manufacturing industry business model. over the past decade, 4ir is witnessing increasing attention by both scholars and practitioners due to its ability to achieve high competitiveness growth and innovation. the adoption of 4ir technologies (i4t) can tremendously improve the operational performance of any industry and it can solve many difficulties linked to the production process, the provision of services, and the overall supply chain. in this context, a pilot study was carried out in the automotive industry where managers from 51 us and eu firms were interviewed to investigate the 4ir technologies adopted within their manufacturing practices. the aim of the current study is to examine the most utilized 4ir solutions among 16 key technologies and then to tackle the correlations between those and multiple operational performance metrics (opms). findings showed that more than 80% of the respondents were implementing multiple 4ir technologies at a time. the latter was found to be significantly correlated with the studied opms. the technologies that mostly improve quality were cloud computing (p < .05), additive manufacturing (p < .05), and industrial internet (p < .01). additive manufacturing also boosted the efficiency and productivity performance (p < .01), while employee morale was positively correlated with cyber security implementation (p < .01). furthermore, the better delivery performance was noticed by mainly employing virtualization (p < .05), and industrial internet (p < .1). finally, both cloud computing (p < .01) and cyber security (p < .05) had a significant impact on cost reduction.",industry 4.0,,"investigation in the us and eu automotive industry joelle nader school of engineering, office of the graduate studies and research, lebanese american university, p.o. box 36, byblos 48328, lebanon joelle.nader@lau.edu.lb mohamad ali mezher and raed el-khalil* information technology and operations management, lebanese american university, p.o. box 13-5053, chouran beirut: 1102 2801, lebanon raed.elkhalil@lau.edu.lb, mohammadali.mezher@lau.edu *corresponding author",
306,Flexibility And Operational Performance: Examining The  Mediating Role Of Lean And Sustainability Practices,"over the last decades, the world is encountering an increase in global manufacturing competitiveness (gmc). flexible manufacturing systems (fms), a major pillar in achieving gmc, has lately witnessed a unique advancement and became a vital part of the intelligent manufacturing system. in order to preserve the industry’s place with all the fluctuation in the market environment, an adoption of new manufacturing philosophies such as lean manufacturing systems (lms) and fms coupled with good sustainability practices remains mandatory. this paper would fill the reserach gap by exploring the relationship between fms, lms, sustainability, and their impact on the textile industry’s operational performance. accordingly, the present paper discusses the effect of strategic, operational, and tactical flexibility dimensions, lean manufacturing, and sustainability practices (economic, social, and environmental) on different operational performance metrics (opms). a survey questionnaire was structured based on in-depth literature and was conducted in 82 us and european textile facilities. hypotheses testing and polynomial regression coupled to response surface analysis were performed for model validation and detection of significant linear, quadratic, and mediating effects of the studied variables on sales, cost, and productivity. the data analysis carried out in the present pilot study showed that the lms implementation played a major role in mediating the fms-opms relationships (p < 0.001), while at a time sustainability practices significantly enhanced the positive effect of lms on all opms and primarily on sales and productivity while drastically reducing costs (p < .001).",,,"joelle nader school of engineering, office of the graduate studies and research, lebanese american university, p.o. box 36, byblos 48328, lebanon joelle.nader@lau.edu.lb raed el-khalil* information technology and operations management, lebanese american university, p.o. box 13-5053, chouran beirut: 1102 2801, lebanon raed.elkhalil@lau.edu.lb *corresponding author",
307,The Role Of Lean In Enhancing Operational Performance  Through Sustainability And Supply Chain Practices: A Case,"globalization, increasing awareness of environmental issues, and advances in technology have forced manufacturing industries to adopt new and innovative practices to navigate these unprecedented challenges. accordingly, companies started to reassemble their distinctive capabilities and supply chain practices to reach customers from different geographical locations, increase profits, expand sourcing opportunities, and offer a wide selection of services and products. at the same time, firms started to implement lean tools, which are tools that eliminate wastes in the value chain, such as just-in-time (jit), 5s, seven wastes, and kanban. while previous studies asserted the significance of implementing lean tools while improving current supply chain and sustainability practices, there has been little investigation on the interaction of the three, and their intertwined effect on operational performance. therefore, the purpose of this paper is to explore the link between lean manufacturing, supply chain practices and sustainability practices, and their impact on operational performance metrics. a survey questionnaire was developed based on previous literature and practitioners’ feedback and sent to 94 american and european automotive facilities. the results generated from the pilot study revealed that there is a significant correlation between lean, supply chain and sustainability practices, and operational performance (p < .05). moreover, the data indicated that lean manufacturing, through planning, sourcing, and production constructs enhances delivery, efficiency, and quality (p < .05). in addition, supply chain practices, when coupled with sustainability, had a significant positive effect on operational performance (p < .001) while at a time, sustainability practices were found to have a significant mediating effect on the lean- performance relationship (p < 0.001).",,,"study on the automotive industry raed el-khalil information technology and operations management, lebanese american university, p.o. box 13-5053, chouran beirut: 1102 2801, lebanon raed.elkhalil@lau.edu.lb joelle nader* school of engineering, office of the graduate studies and research, lebanese american university, p.o. box 36, byblos 48328, lebanon joelle.nader@lau.edu.lb *corresponding author",
308,Strategic Manufacturing Planning And Performance In The  Food Industry: The Mediating Influence Of Sustainability.,"the constantly changing environment, economic fluctuations, and product and services proliferation made the manufacturing plant’s strategic planning a crucial decision any firm should base its operations on. strategic manufacturing planning (smp) witnessed an increased interest among scholars and practitioners due to its role in defining the success of any manufacturing firm. this study found a lack of empirical research, in the food industry, on the combined effect of smp and sustainability on industrial performance. therefore, this paper investigates the interaction between smp and sustainability practices, and its impact on operational performance metrics (opms). a survey questionnaire was developed based on previous studies and sent to 104 food manufacturing firms. the survey consists of four smp constructs: comprehensiveness, focus, horizon, and intensity, three sustainability dimensions: economic, social, and environmental, and four opms: cost, quality, delivery, and employees’ morale and retention. the results show significant positive correlations (p < .05) between smp, sustainability practices, and opms. additionally, findings generated from polynomial regression, sobel-statistics tests, analysis of variance (anova) and response surface analysis reveal that sustainability practices play a major role in mediating the relationship between strategic manufacturing planning and operational performance (p < .001). this paper is unique in its depth and breadth since it is the first study that examines the comprehensive effect of strategic manufacturing planning and sustainability practices on the food industry performance. furthermore, academicians and decision-makers can benefit from the developed model in determining the best practices to implement based on the targeted performance metric to be improved.",,,"joelle nader school of engineering, office of the graduate studies and research, lebanese american university, p.o. box 36, byblos 48328, lebanon joelle.nader@lau.edu.lb raed el-khalil* information technology and operations management, lebanese american university, p.o. box 13-5053, chouran beirut: 1102 2801, lebanon raed.elkhalil@lau.edu.lb *corresponding author",

310,Towards The Development Of Internet Tracker Mobile  Application Based On User’S Preferences,"the covid-19 pandemic has driven educational institutions worldwide to shift their mode of delivery online where internet connectivity plays a crucial role in the continuity of learning and sustainability of the student outcomes. with the philippines having one of the slowest internet speeds in the world, it is not unusual for students and teachers to encounter problems concerning connectivity. the aim of this study is to produce a mobile application that would monitor internet connectivity and consumption. the target respondents of this study are students from different universities in the national capital region. explanatory case study design is used to determine how and why internet connectivity is slow, while exploratory case study design is used to answer who and what aspects and factors affect the internet connectivity. input-process-output (ipo) model is used to determine the questions to be asked to the respondents, on how the data would be analyzed, and the probable solution that would be proposed to answer the main problem of the study. the proponents had identified the different user requirements by incorporating quality function deployment (qfd) in order to generate specific features that must be included on the mobile application to satisfy the user’s needs and expectations.","online classes, mobile application","The continuity of learning through online delivery during the pandemic still faces several challenges among the students; one of which is having weak internet connectivity that causes the students to miss their class or fail to submit requirements. Through the collated results of survey questionnaires, the proponents of this study had performed data analyzation that led to graphical representation consisting of data percentage and frequencies. The results show that majority of the respondents experience weak internet connectivity. Despite connecting to the top service internet provider, there are still instances of losing internet connection 1 to 3 times caused by the low signal acquisition from their locales. Another factor of weak internet connectivity was the number of devices or individuals connected to the internet, wherein internet connectivity weakens or slows down were due to the bandwidth max consumption. The proponents of this study had synthesized that they will build a mobile application for the user to monitor their internet stability and bandwidth consumption whenever they are connected to the internet. The opportunities that the study could offer are applicable not only to its target population but also to the mobile developers, internet service providers, and educational institution. These are as follows: 1. The study would be providing an additive information to internet service providers about the performance of the service that their customers are receiving based on their locale. 2. The collated results of the study will aid mobile developers if they aim to modify the proposed application to be developed. 3. The study will provide educational institutions sufficient proof in giving out consideration to the students in accepting work pass the deadline due to internet complications. 4. The developed application will be able to send a notification of internet disconnection to the user, thus they could also export the dashboard as a valid proof of their weak internet connectivity on that period. 5. The application that will be developed will help the user to monitor their internet speed, and their consumption either chronological (time period) or categorical (downloads, uploads, and stream).

313,"The Influence Of Promotion And Price On E-Commerce  Impulse Purchase In Bandung, Indonesia","this study aims to determine the effect of promotion and price on impulse buying of shopee users in bandung city. this study uses quantitative research methods and uses a likert scale as a measurement. the population used in this study are consumers who use the shopee application, and consumers who have made transactions at shopee with a research sample of 100 respondents. this research technique is multiple linear regression analysis processed using spss 22 for windows. based on the hypothesis test conducted, it shows that partially there is an influence for the promotion and price variables on impulse buying. promotion has a value of 3.503 (to)> 1.66071 (tα) partially has a positive and significant effect on impulse buying and price has a value of 2.881 (to)> 1.66071 (tα) partially has a positive and significant effect on impulse buying. the conclusion of this study is that the promotion and price variables have an influence on the impulse buying variable by 44.5% and the remaining 55.5% is influenced by other variables not examined in this study.","promotion, price, impulse buying","described above, the authors try to provide suggestions that can be used for company improvement and insights for future researchers. The suggestions from the author are as follows: a. Based on the research results, the promotional variable dimensions that have the lowest value are the sales promotion dimension with the statement ""Shopee gave me points after I reviewed the items purchased"". Therefore, researchers provide suggestions for Shopee to give points to consumers who provide reviews in the form of text that contains an explanation of the product, not only giving points to consumers who provide reviews in the form of photos or videos. b. Based on the research results, the variable price dimension which has the lowest value is the dimension of affordability with the statement ""I often shop at Shopee because the prices offered are affordable"". Therefore, researchers provide suggestions for Shopee to pay more attention to the prices set so that the prices of Shopee products can be reached by the public and can compete with other e-commerce applications, one example is by giving discounts or giving free shipping on repeat purchases. c. Based on the results of research, the dimension of impulse buying variable which has the lowest value is the dimension of indifference to the consequences with the statement ""When buying goods at Shopee, consumers do not think about the mismatch of the product being purchased"". Therefore impulse buying activities are expected to meet consumer needs and the impulse buying system is also expected to benefit consumers so that these activities can provide motivation for consumers to buy a product. 4.2 Suggestions for Further Researchers It is recommended for further researchers to be able to examine other factors that can influence Impulse Buying Shopee users, for example: Electronic Word Of Mouth and so on. Conduct research using the theory of different and latest experts so that it can enrich the treasury of science in the field of marketing. Conduct research on other similar companies using the same variables so that the results can be used as a comparison.

314,Performance Analysis Of A Tri-Adjustable Automated Heavyduty Handling System Designed On Industry 4.0,"over the years, many south african industries have been using forklift trucks to move bigger loads from one point to another till today. the use of large forklift trucks within indoor manufacturing processes poses ohs risks to workers as its internal combustion engine (ice) produces fumes (carbon monoxide, co) when in operation and exhaust fumes, (co), are harmful to human’s health. on this basis, a new system design is recommended to eliminate the use of mhs that relies on ice power source to prevent ohs risks in indoor manufacturing industries. in this project, autodesk inventor professional software was used for design development of technical drawings and simulation as well as validation of the new system’s structure. vehicle dynamics’ principles and equations are used to determine the overall rolling resistance, tractive effort of the new system, wheel torque, and the power required to drive the system under 20 – ton load capacity. the new system design has been developed to operate using a hydraulic power pack source, where it consists of four hydraulic wheel hubs for driving the system, four hydraulic cylinders for lifting & lowering, and a double rod end hydraulic cylinder for steering. electro- hydraulic circuit systems were developed and proposed using electronics and fluid mechanics phenomena. again, principles, laws and equations of strength of materials has been carried out for validation of the material selection of the new design system’s structure as well as verifying buckling, deflection & bending stresses, and moments.","manufacturing, hydraulics","The research beacame a success whereby a new proposed MHS has been designed using Autodesk Inventor Professional and material selection of the new design system’s components has been carried out and verified in relation with their strength & reliability properties. Through this paper and its engineering analysis, it is proven that the use of internal combustion engines in heavy duty handling systems that are operated within indoor manufactring factories and or internal logistics can be eliminated and replaced with an eco-friendly hydraulic systems technology. Therefore, this new system design promotes Occupational Health and Safety of people working in industrial areas where Bulk Material Handling systems are in place. The new system was designed and it consist of four double-acting hydraulic cylinders interconnected with spreader beam responsible for lifting and lowering, as well as two double-acting hydraulic cylinders that will expand the system making it adjustable, a hydraulic steering cylinder for steering & turning the wheels and four hydraulic motors that will drive the system from point A to point B. Electric hydraulic components selection for new design system has been conducted. Vehicle dynamics of the new proposed system were modelled, tested, and verified. The overall system’s TE was calculated to discover the power required for the hydraulic wheel hub motor’ to move the new proposed system under 20-ton load. When the new design system is under 20-ton load, TE was found to be 250.623 kN, hydraulic wheel hub motor torque was 149.1 kN.m and power required to overcome TE was 468.411 W, on each wheel.","principles s.z. mafokwane department of mechanical and industrial engineering technology university of johannesburg johannesburg, south africa zamashaun@gmail.com daramy vandi von kallon department of mechanical and industrial engineering technology university of johannesburg johannesburg, south africa dkallon@uj.ac.za",
315,An Assessment Of Failure Modes And Criticality Analysis In  A Pharmaceutical Industry By Rpn Method,"pharmaceutical industry is one of the most rising industries in bangladesh where various types of medicines are administrated to people with a view to curing them. many workers as well as top and middle management are responsible to run the industry successfully. but because of not taking proper precautions, different failure causes result in various failure modes in each section of the industry that may affect the safety issue of the workers and effectiveness of the industry. in this research work, failure caused and failure modes were determined through performing a survey. risk priority number method was evaluated for each failure modes caused by subsequent reasons of failures by learning the severity, detection and occurrence of each failure form. the higher risk priority number resulted in the greater criticality caused by failure modes. proper preventive methods were encouraged to carry out to mitigate the criticality and to ensure proper working environment for all the workers involved in the pharmaceutical industry.","pharmaceutical, criticality, work environment, failure modes","Workers spend most of the time in work place. If there are higher failure modes in the working environment, the efficiency as well as the safety of the workers are in stake. Failure modes and failure causes were evaluated in the research work. Also RPN method was prioritized to find out the major failure modes. Risk priority number played a vital role to find out the failure causes and failure modes. By analyzing criticality of the failure modes using risk priority number method, it was quite obvious that the chances of failures and risks are very high in a pharmaceutical industry. These may lead to various types of disorders and accidents. Overall it would have a negative impact on the safety culture for the industry. Future preventive methods have to be taken by the management for the safety purpose by making availability of the safety instruments as well as establishing discipline and training.","nourin mohsin and rafat mahmud hridoy department of industrial engineering and management (iem) khulna university of engineering & technology ahonanourin27@gmail.com , rafathridoy1@iem.kuet.ac.bd",
316,Review Of Pension Systems In Institutions Of Higher  Learning: Key Lessons For Zambia,"old age poverty is inevitable in africa, so is the need for pension provision. the three main public universities (unza, cbu and mu) in zambia are facing financial challenges mainly due to the pension systems adopted by these institutions of higher learning. in order to curtail the high growth rate of the pension debt, the government expressed the need for pension reform in the three universities. the objective of this paper was to draw lessons from pension systems adopted by institutions of higher learning outside zambia. this was a qualitative study that focused mainly on the number of pillars adopted by the institutions of higher learning of the selected countries. an analysis of the results indicated that most institutions of higher learning have at least a two-pillar pension system. further, the results revealed that the uk and usa have associations of universities and colleges that play a vital role in the pension reform process. the research concludes that saving for retirement is a collective responsibility of both employers and recommends for the work on pension reform to be continued in light of experiences of other countries.","pension systems, pillar, reform","The call for pension reform in public universities in Zambia, is an indicator of both affordability and sustainability of the pension systems in the public universities (Ministry of Higher Education, 2018 and Grant Thornton, 2017). The aim of this paper was to draw lessons from other countries for the policy-makers in the institutions of higher learning in Zambia. The paper adopted a comparative approach by analysing the pension pillar system in Chile, UK, Denmark, Ghana, USA, Israel, Nigeria and Zambia. More importantly, the paper discussed the pension system in the institutions of higher learning in UK, Israel, USA, Nigeria and Zambia. Arising from the comparative analysis undertaken, the following were revealed; Firstly, Chile, UK, Denmark and Ghana have a mandatory two-pillar pension system while Zambia has a mandatory one-pillar pension system. Secondly, most of the occupational pension system in pillar-two, are DC plans operating under highly regulated financial markets in order to protect the retirees’ savings. Third, the institutions of higher learning in UK, Israel, USA and Zambia all have a minimum of two-pillars. Lastly, the UK and USA have associations that review the conditions of service of the member institutions. Therefore, the following key lessons can be drawn from the comparative analysis. First, pension adequacy can be achieved by having more than one-pillar pension system. For instance, the UK basic pension is considered the most generous system, but the UK seeks to achieve better adequacy by having mandatory workplace pension schemes. In Denmark the occupational pension schemes are enshrined in the collective agreements of all employers as a legal requirement for pillar two. Second, saving for retirement is a collective responsibility of both the employers and the employees. This is evidenced by the wide existence of DC occupational pension schemes in the countries considered in this study. Third, the Government of Republic of Zambia should consider reforms in the laws that govern pension administration and financial markets with a view of protecting retirees’ savings. This encourages participation from more players. Last, having associations of universities and colleges enhances unit of purpose amongst the institutions of higher learning and plays a key role in pension reform. For instance, in the UK, the UUK and UCEA work together in promoting the interests of both the employees and employers. There are several lessons available to policy-makers from this comparative study apart from the ones identified above. As the public universities undertake pension reform process, it is imperative for the policy makers to consider the drivers of the proposed reform and the impact on the current and future employees. The policy-makers may wish to consider some of the lessons highlighted in this paper especially on the pillar approach without ignoring the income replacement ratio regardless of the number of pillars in the pension system. However, more pillars demonstrate a good risk management approach in managing the pension related risks. This study had its own limitations which can be addressed by future studies. First, the impact of Covid-19 pandemic was not intensively considered in this paper but its impact on retirees’ savings is inevitable. Second, the paper adopted a qualitative approach leaving room for a quantitative approach. Furthermore, this study can be enriched by including more countries and inclusion of replacement ratios for a better comparative study.

321,Significance Of Intruder Detection Techniques In The Context  Of Industry 4.0,"with the advent of industry 4.0, many physical systems are transforming into cyber-physical systems (cps). as these cps are connected to the internet, have a lot of vulnerabilities. there is a need to protect them from cyber-attacks. this is true across domains. many cyber-attacks are being reported in the literature. these cyber-attacks had devastating effects. the cyber-attacks not only result in an economic loss but also resulted in the loss of effort and inconvenience. hence a complete understanding of the type of cyber-attacks and predicting the behavior of intruders is very much important for protecting cps. though many cyber-attacks are reported across multiple domains, the type of attacks is unique about each domain. this makes solving security problems even more difficult. what is also observed from the literature review is that the security infrastructure that is available today may not be secure for tomorrow. this clearly shows the complexity of solving the security problems- intrusion detection system(ids). hence, an effort has been made in this work to consolidate different types of attacks reported across multiple domains. this is valuable not only for academicians but also for researchers and practitioners, as this paper contains not only the work reported so far but also provides future directions for promoting further research in the area of intruder detection.","cps, industry 4.0, big data, intruder detection","With the advent of Industry 4.0, many types of equipment used in manufacturing and other domains are being transformed into cyber-physical systems. These cyber-physical systems are highly vulnerable to cyber-attacks. As they are exposed through the internet. Thus, they require protection from cyber-attacks. Many researchers have been working on intrusion detection techniques for protecting these cyber-physical systems. The types of cyber-attacks are unique to each domain. Hence, an attempt is made in this research work to portray the different cyber protection schemes implemented in (i) Smart Grids (ii) Nuclear Power Plants (iii) Cross Border Intruder detection. Figure 10 shows the research progress in different domains about intruder detection. As can be seen from figure 10, much work has been done in the area of smart grids. Much work remains to be done in other areas. With the advent of Big-data analytics and cloud-based wireless sensor networks, data capture, data storage, analysis, and decision making have become more efficient. Researchers have claimed that this architecture achieves efficient results regarding analysis, storage, and also performance in intruder detection. The researchers have also studied the performance of the system using the CloudSim simulator. The researchers have also studied the effect on storage cost by using the number of servers ranging from 30-50. One of the objectives of Intruder detection is to increase the accuracy of intruder identification. To address the limitations of HIDS, a researcher has proposed an intelligent intruder detection system that will improve the reliability and efficiency of IDS in nuclear companies. This scheme make use of two cameras and deep learning technologies for tracking intruder behavior detection. When the size of data, coming from camera sensors, increases, using a single server will take more data processing time. In such scenarios, it is advisable to go for the parallel processor. The size of the data may be as huge as 100GB. Researchers have used spark workstations fitted with the graphic processing unit. Most cyber-physical smart grids are also provided with mitigation efforts for achieving a compromise between the system and the attacker to reduce the undesired impacts of cyber-attacks Sequential optimization is normally used to achieve the objectives. Many of these techniques have assumed fixed behavior from different attackers. This is a very unrealistic assumption. Cyber-attacks do vary from attacker to attacker. One of the biggest challenges in designing a system against cyber-attacks is that the attacks vary continuously from time to time. Though many researchers have been working, over the years, in designing effective intruder detection algorithms, much work needs to be done in enhancing the security level offered by intruder detection schemes. Also, it is observed that there is a need to improve the detection accuracy, detection speed, and robustness of the detection algorithms. Also, there is a need for further reduction in the costs of hardware such as thermal camera and Vision camera to make the intruder detection system more economical. This would enable the Intruder detection schemes to be used in other domains as well. As of today, Intruder detection systems are being used only in few domains. There is a wide scope for implementing intruder detection systems in aerospace, shipbuilding, construction, hospitals, agriculture, textiles, banking, and other non- manufacturing industries as well. There is a wide scope for using a heterogenous swarm of cyber-physical systems for both intruder detection as well as monitoring the intruders. There is also a wide scope of using robotic swarms for monitoring and detecting intruders. The trend is intellectualization and integration with multiple sensors to enhance the overall security of the cyber-physical system. To meet the security-related challenges of today’s industries, there is a need for designing and developing a heterogenous swarm of cyber-physical systems, for comprehensively understanding the state of the given system. Also, there is a wide scope for introducing the evolutionary features inherent in the biological systems. Thus, interested researchers may use an artificial intelligence-based heterogeneous swarm of cyber-physical systems, for addressing or addressing the security problems of industries. Many use cases will have to be demonstrated by researchers regarding crisis management and monitoring industrial premises by using robotics swarms.

The performance of health workers at the Makassar City Hajj Hospital will improve. 5. Discussion The result of work in quality and quantity achieved by an employee in carrying out his duties following the responsibilities assigned to him is referred to as performance or work performance—factors influencing performance achievement, namely the ability factor (ability) and motivation factor (motivation). Employee abilities are divided into two categories: potential powers and reality abilities. This means that employees with above-average potential, adequate education for their positions, and skill in performing daily tasks will find it easier to meet expectations. The attitude of an employee in dealing with work situations determines the motivation factor. Motivation is a condition that drives employees to achieve organizational goals. Performance is a measure of healthcare success that demonstrates the accountability of service institutions within good governance. The main business in health services is various service levels and patient care, and nursing services are mainstream along the continuum of care. Nurses typically initiate efforts to improve the quality and performance of clinical services through various activities such as quality control groups, the application of nursing standards, problem-solving approaches, and nursing audits. The experience of patients and the community with the services they receive, according to Berwick (2001), is the most crucial link that needs to be considered in enhancing the quality and performance of health services. Meanwhile, according to WHO (2002), Performance Management development is a process improvement strategy in microsystems that supports and develops nurses' and midwives' clinical competence to perform professionally while paying attention to ethics, values, and legal elements in health services. It attempts to improve nurses' and midwives' clinical performance by clarifying roles and tasks, professional development and shared learning. 6. Conclusion A quality health service approach can ensure that health care organizations always produce quality health services, that is, health services that comply with patients' expectations and needs. The use of a health service quality approach will increase the efficiency of health care organizations. The use of a quality health service approach will make health care organizations respected, well-known, and always sought after by everyone in need of excellent health care and a pleasant place to work for health workers. The adoption of the health service quality approach will primarily focus on the output of health services. Therefore it must complete each work correctly for health services to be precious to patients. The health service quality strategy will promote job satisfaction, commitment, and morale in the health care profession, ultimately leading to patient satisfaction.","at the general hospital of the makassar city hajj area deni anggreani sutomo and abdul latief sekolah tinggi ilmu ekonomi amkop makassar, indonesia denianggreanisutomo@gmail.com, abdul.latief@stieamkop.ac.id, ekafadly jusuf universitas hasanuddin, makassar, indonesia ekafadly.yusuf@yahoo.com fatmawati universitas puangrimaggalatung, makassar, indonesia fatmawati@uniprima.ac.id m chairul basrun umanailo universitas iqra buru, maluku, indonesia chairulbasrun@gmail.com irwan ledang iain ambon, indonesia irwanledangebook@gmail.com muhammad hanafi indonesian department of ums rappang afied70@gmail.com",

Based on this, if leadership is effective, employee work discipline will also increase, so that the work effectiveness of employees at the Soppeng Education and Culture Office will also increase. 5. Discussion Leadership is regarded as a fundamental driving force for businesses to establish a new culture conducive to change. Many people believe that leadership is directly tied to an organization's success. Leaders in an organization have a disproportionate influence on the organization's success or failure. An organization's performance is a description of the leader's performance in managing the organization. A good leader will guide, persuade, and monitor others to carry out tasks following his directions to realize organizational goals. Managers' ability and leadership skills in direction are critical factors in their performance. The organization's ability to pick influential leaders will improve if it can identify the attributes connected with leadership. And, if the organization can discover effective leadership behaviours and strategies, it will accomplish personal effectiveness development in the organization. The ability of the leaders and their supporters demonstrates that human resources are vital in government since government activities are primarily dependent on the activities of the apparatus as members of government organizations. Then, based on the operations of the government machinery, its efficacy in achieving government objectives and efficiency in utilizing the resources at its disposal may be seen. This suggests that the leader's competence to manage resources is required to fulfil the company's goals or improve organizational performance. The quality of the leader is frequently seen as an essential aspect in the organization's success or failure, as well as the success or failure of an organization, both corporate and public focused, is usually recognized as the success or failure of the leader. The leader's job is so crucial that it has become a focus of interest for researchers in the field of organizational behaviour. Leaders are critical in developing and implementing corporate strategies. As a result, every leader is obligated to devote substantial attention to designing, mobilizing, and guiding all potential employees in their environment to realize the volume and workload oriented toward the goal. In addition, leaders must provide authentic coaching to employees to increase employee satisfaction and organizational commitment and promote high performance.

An increase in exemplary organizational commitment will also impact improving employee performance for the better.","regional general hospitals in majene regency rahmitasari, ansar, ekafadly jusuf sekolah tinggi ilmu ekonomi amkop makassar, indonesia rahmitasari@gmail.com, ansar@gmail.com, ekafadlyjusuf@yahoo.com ery wardanengsih universitas puangrimaggalatung, makassar, indonesia ery@uniprima.ac.id zulfikar lating stikes maluku husada fikarlating@gmail.com yusriadi yusriadi sekolah tinggi ilmu administrasi puangrimaggalatung, makassar, indonesia yusriadi.yusriadi@uqconnect.edu.au krisnawati setyaningrum nugraheni sekolah tinggi ilmu ekonomi pariwisata indonesia krisnawati.stiepari@gmail.com",

Someone will like a job if the job is following their abilities, so he feels proud to do it. Jobs that are unpopular and less challenging are usually not able to be the driving force. Even the work tends to be a boring routine and not become pride. Therefore strong motivation plays an essential role in discovering TB patients in the Polman District Health Office. The presence or absence of a motivational impetus in an officer in carrying out his work in an organization will reflect the quality of service that is efficient, timely, according to procedures, maximum and professional following what is needed by patients or the community. A reasonably good quality of service from an officer will produce optimal satisfaction for patients or the community. 5. Conclusion Based on the results of research and discussion previously stated, it can be concluded several things as follows: Competence has a positive and significant effect on the quality of service of officers in Polman District Health Office; Motivation has a positive and significant impact on the quality of service of officers in Polman District Health Office; Service quality influences positive and significant impact on the discovery of TB patients in the Polman District Health Office; Competence has a positive and significant effect on the discovery of TB patients in the Polman District Health Office; Motivation has a positive and significant effect on the discovery of TB patients in the Polman District Health Office; Competence has a positive and significant effect on findings TB patients through the quality of service officers in the Polman District Health Office; motivation has a positive and significant effect on TB patients' discovery through service officers' grades in the Health Office Polman Regency.","services in the health office polman ahmad and akmal umar sekolah tinggi ilmu ekonomi amkop makassar, indonesia ahmad251072@gmail.com, akamal.u@gmail.com ekafadly jusuf universitas hasanuddin, makassar, indonesia ekafadly.yusuf@yahoo.com masrah hasan universitas puangrimaggalatung masrah.nh@gmail.com yusriadi yusriadi sekolah tinggi ilmu administrasi puangrimaggalatung, makassar, indonesia yusriadi.yusriadi@uqconnect.edu.au m chairul basrun umanailo universitas iqra buru chairulbasrun@gmail.com andiwi meifilina universitas islam balitar, indonesia. andiwi.uibalitar@gmail.com",

Still, it turns out that staffing can also affect the quality of the performance of a nurse in charge. From the research carried out by nurses at the West Sulawesi Provincial Hospital, there are still many who have D3 Nursing education. Apart from that, nursing nurses are also rarely and never given training on patient safety. One of the advantages of someone having a good knowledge is to improve the quality of the performance that is being carried out because that person will apply the knowledge they have in the current field of work. In wrestling, but several factors make a person feel discouraged in carrying out the task at hand. Among them is because the leader lacks motivation and encouragement. Likely, the results that subordinates have obtained are not considered by the boss or the people around him. Apart from that, what can affect minimum wages can also affect employees who are reluctant to carry out their duties properly, so that from this, the quality of the service can decrease or not be carried out well at all.","through the quality of nursing services at the regional hospital kasmiaty, baharuddin, and muhammad nur fattah sekolah tinggi ilmu ekonomi amkop makassar, indonesia kasmiaty@gmail.com, baharuddinamkop@gmail.com, fattahnur@yahoo.com dewi mulfiyanti akademi keperawatan lapatau bone, indonesia dewwimulfiyanti@gmail.com ermawati akademi kebidanan lapatau bone, indonesia eemhamy@gmail.com m chairul basrun umanailo universitas iqra buru chairulbasrun@gmail.com irwan hadi stikes yarsi mataram irwanhadi711@gmail.com",

Furthermore, the study found that there is a significant favorable influence of DAU on economic growth. Then, (Stepvani Uhise, 2013), research shows that DAU has a significant-good power on Economic Growth. The effect of local indigenous income on poverty is negative. It means that the increase in local indigenous revenue will be followed by reducing poverty, assuming factors are considered constant. The study results are in line with research that there is an influence of local native income on poverty. Then, research (Paul, Koleangan, & Engka, 2017) found that the impact of Regional Native Income on poverty is negative The Effect of the General Allocation Fund on Poverty. The variable effect of general allocation funds on poverty is negative. It means that the increase in available allocation funds will be followed by reducing poverty, assuming other factors are considered constant. This study's results are in line with the statement (Hanif, 2005)that weak planning in the allocation of spending poses inefficiencies to the performance of this, impacting. This study's results are in line with (Paseki, Greri, & Naukoko, 2014) that the general allocation fund has a significant effect on poverty reduction.

This research shows a significant influence of the region's native income on poverty through economic growth. This is seen in the results of the path analysis. Economic growth can affect pad against poverty. The effect of the General Allocation Fund on Poverty through Economic Growth is significant. We can see from path analysis. Thus, economic growth can influence the general allocation fund against poverty. This study's results also follow Todaro's statement (in (Nurmainah, 2013) that the accumulation of capital occurs when a portion of the revenue is reinvested to increase output. The source of the investment funds comes from DAU. Funds sourced from the state budget are allocated for regional equalization. The effect of economic growth on poverty is negative. It means increased economic growth followed by poverty reduction, assuming other factors are considered constant. This study shows the negative influence of economic growth on poverty. This study supports the results (Tambunan, 2011) that economic growth is not accompanied by employment opportunities creating a gap, which then creates economic growth conditions and increased poverty levels. Growth with poverty has a strong correlation because poverty tends to rise in the early stages of development. Near the end of the story, the number of poor people decreases gradually (Tambunan, 2011). 5.

The influence of work experience variables on job satisfaction is negative. This study's results are not in line with the findings (Alfian & Reno, 2015), which state that work experience significantly affects job satisfaction. Employees' knowledge does not fully support their happiness at work; this is because their experience does not bring out their potential by the field of work they want to do; this is contrary to the opinion (Ucup Yusup, 2016). states that ""experience brings out one's potential. The full potential will emerge gradually over time in response to various experiences"". The effect of work ethic on performance is positive. This result is supported by the statement (Hardiansyah, 2017) that work ethic is dedication and devotion to a job with essential values. Employees with a high work ethic are shown from their behavior such as working hard somewhat, making the best use of their time, working hours, strong desire in selfless organizations, cooperation, respect for their peers. These results support previous findings (Muhammad Zulham, 2008), which concluded that work ethic has a significant effect on employee performance. Furthermore, research by (Hardiansyah 2017) found that work ethic positively influences employee performance. The effect of work experience on employee performance is positive but insignificant. This result is supported by Trijoko's (2008) statement that work experience is a skill and knowledge that individuals master by individuals from actions and behaviors they have done during a specific period. Through this experience, they become more skilled and proficient in completing work and duties as a responsibility. Repetitive activities can increase one's abilities and knowledge. Meanwhile, according to (Mangkuprawira 2007), performance results from employment based on the quality/quantity that a person achieves in completing his duties according to his responsibilities in an efficient, effective, and reliable manner. This study's results are not in line with previous research results (Wanceslaus Bili, 2018); in conclusion, it shows that work experience significantly affects employee performance. This study's results indicate a significant positive effect of work ethic on employee performance through job satisfaction. This can be seen from the indirect path analysis of work ethics through job satisfaction, which significantly affects employee performance. Thus, job satisfaction can influence work ethic on employee performance. Etos also shows attitudes. And someone's hopes. This is also in line with the findings (Hardiansyah, 2017) and (Saputra, 2018) that work ethic positively and significantly affects employee performance. Work experience on performance through job satisfaction is negative, meaning that an improvement does not follow an increase in work experience in employee performance through job satisfaction. The path analysis of the indirect effect of work experience through job satisfaction positively influences employee performance. Thus, job satisfaction can impact work experience on employee performance. Still, after the total impact is carried out, it shows a negative value, meaning that after combining or adding up the effect's direct and indirect negative results, this relationship pattern becomes insignificant. The effect of job satisfaction on performance is negative. An improvement does not follow an increase in job satisfaction in employee performance if other factors that influence it are considered constant. This study's results are not in line with the survey results (Tobing, 2009), the conclusion that there is a significant effect of job satisfaction on employee performance. Furthermore, this study is not in line with Wanda Febriyana's (2015) findings that job satisfaction on employee performance has a positive and significant effect. 5. Conclusions The research results and discussion is related to work ethic, work experience, and job satisfaction on employee performance. It can be concluded that work ethic has a significant positive effect on job satisfaction at the Regional Secretariat of Central Mamuju Regency. Thus, that work ethic affects job satisfaction.

A Study Of Passion And  Perseverance In University Students,"grit is a personality trait that affects human attitudes and behavior in various contexts. researches showed that grit is a significant predictor of a person's success, both in education and occupation. grit consists of the consistency of interest and perseverance. the purpose of this study is to describe grit in university students. the instrument of this study is the grit scale based on duckworth theory. the participants of this research are 354 students in the city of semarang. we used a cluster random sampling technique to select the participants of the study. we used descriptive statistics in jasp. the results show that 23,17% of students on the high grit level, 65,5% of students at a moderate level, and 11,3% on a low level. the implication of this study will be discussed further in this article.","grit, passion, perseverance, 2007","Several things affect the level of grit in a person. Previous research results state that mindset and personality are one of the factors that affect grit (Angela L. Duckworth et al., 2007; Reed et al., 2013; Yeager & Dweck, 2012). There was a significant positive relationship between grit and mindset in students (Ryan, 2015). Students with a growth mindset are individuals who believe in the potential to develop with increasingly difficult challenges. They believe in achieving the goal by learning anything. The learning process will encounter challenges and difficulties. However, a growth mindset makes someone believe in overcoming the challenge with effort and perseverance. A growth mindset has a focus on the learning process, not on the drive to be smart. When experiencing failure, they look for strategies and solutions, ask for help from others when needed (Dweck & Yeager, 2019; Yeager & Dweck, 2012).","sukma adi galuh amawidyati, fatma kusuma mahanani, isnaeni mas’udah vertika aprilolita and silviana irawati department of psychology, faculty of education, universitas negeri semarang, indonesia sukmaadi@mail.unnes.ac.id, fatma.psi@mail.unnes.ac.id, isnaeni.masudah26@gmail.com, vertika.aprilolita@yahoo.com, silviana_irawati99@yahoo.com",
413,The Capability And Electability Of Local Government   In Improving Administration Development,"this study aims to see the flexibility and capability of regional heads in carrying out their governance performance in serving public problems after becoming elected heads. research. this research methodology is a quantitative method with the population of palembang city which is spread over 16 districts and 107 sub-districts and taken according to the existing regulations. the research findings explain that in palembang, regional heads have autonomous rights to develop their own regions. this is in accordance with the local government administration system in indonesia. regional autonomy is implemented based on the principle of decentralization in the form of a broad, real, and responsible autonomy. in the framework of implementing such broad, real and responsible autonomy, the regional head has a very strategic role in the field of governance, development and community service and is fully responsible for the running of regional government. this study tries to identify some formulations of the level of electability and capability of regional heads before and after regional development contestation.","ocal government, capability","From the results of the data analysis, it can be concluded that the indicators of the electability and capability of a regional head are largely determined by the ability to overcome public problems that are happening in the community. The mayor's capability is considered good when he has the capacity to become a public leader armed with experience so as to attract public sympathy. Regional heads must also have great competence, experience in politics and government, making their popularity and capacity believed to be capable of making superior public policies. Meanwhile, the low electability in each sub-district shows the lack of seriousness in developing the region by answering issues that arise such as the need for economic development programs for farmer groups, infrastructure development solutions to deal with flood problems as a priority, routine environmental hygiene programs and provision of adequate sanitation facilities. so that trash is not littered. Another thing that is no less important at this time is the ability to overcome raising agricultural issues, infrastructure development for solutions to flood problems as a priority program that is delivered to the community and for other candidates who still do not have electability in this region, they must conduct more intensive socialization by offering solutions. to the problems faced by the community as a priority program. Electability must be built by realizing adequate sanitation facilities so that the provision of assistance in making large trash bins placed in various strategic places in this district is a solution that can be done to overcome this problem. In the riverside area, the need for regional settlement arrangement, assistance for the construction of school buildings and construction of clean water installations can be a solution in this area. Electability will strengthen regional heads who are able to create clean residential areas based on public health, maintain security stability, and programs related to infrastructure, including school construction, roads, waste management, health and security for several areas mentioned above.","ivana stisipol candradimuka, palembang, indonesia datasyaivana@gmail.com chairun nasirin college of health sciences (stikes), mataram, indonesia chairun.nasirin@stikes-mataram.ac.id rudy kurniawan university of sriwijaya, palembang, indonesia rudykurniawan@fisip.unsri.ac.id andries lionardo university of sriwijaya, palembang, indonesia andrieslionardo@fisip.unsri.ac.id, m chairul basrun umanailo univesitas iqra buru, indonesia chairulbasrun@gmail.com",

425,Motivation And Incentives On Management Effectiveness  Through Performance Evaluation System At The Soppeng,"this analysis aims to define and evaluate the impact of motivation and rewards on management productivity through the soppeng district police station (polres) performance appraisal framework. this study was performed using a causal design and a quantitative methodology at the polres of soppeng regency. both soppeng district police officers, as many as 351 personnel, were in the sample community. the sampling procedure was carried out using a purposeful sampling technique in this analysis, and the final sample collected was 150. data collection methods are carried out by evaluation, interviews, questionnaires and notes, and data processing techniques using route analysis. the findings revealed that the efficacy of management is the secret to an organization's progress in completing multiple roles and duties in line with predetermined objectives. additionally, benefits are often a consideration that plays a significant role in impacting the success of management. a decent and equitable level of rewards encourages workers to fulfill their tasks optimally. it would further improve the organization's professionalism in performing performance analyses that are done due to high commitment from the apparatus and equal and proportional rewards offered to them.","motivation, incentives","Based on this report's results, it can be inferred that management efficacy is the secret to an organization's progress in being able to carry out its different roles and duties in compliance with its predetermined objectives. Via management quality, the priorities to be accomplished with proper preparation and programming would be obvious, making it very urgent for the department, especially the Soppeng District Police. However, to achieve management efficiency so that the aims or priorities previously set can be accomplished appropriately, there must be encouragement from the apparatus. Besides, benefits are also a component that plays a crucial role in shaping management effectiveness. A decent and proportionate level of rewards encourages workers to conduct their tasks in the best possible manner. As a result of the apparatus's high morale and the equal and proportional benefits offered to them, the organization's integrity in carrying out the success evaluations that are obtained can be further strengthened.","district police station andi ahmad rahmansyah san student of management magister program sekolah tinggi ilmu ekonomi amkop, makassar rahmansyah12@gmail.com muhammad yahya, muhammad nur fattah management program sekolah tinggi ilmu ekonomi amkop, makassar yahya.muhammad@gmail.com, fatah_nur@gmail.com amin toha student of doctoral program universitas muslim indonesia, makassar amintoha6908@gmail.com misnawati law studies department sekolah tinggi ilmu hukum pengayoman misnawati_amir@yahoo.com esther kembauw, maryam sangadji pattimura university ekembauw@yahoo.co.id, maryam_sng@yahoo.co.id",
426,Empowerment Policy Analysis On Performance Through  Institutional Coordination And Quality Assistance At The,"this study aims to define and evaluate the influence of empowerment policy on empowerment efficiency through the collaboration of empowerment institutions and the quality of assistants in the soppeng regency community empowerment service. this study was performed by the soppeng district community empowerment service using a quantitative approach and a simple design. the study's overall population was 116 workers in the community empowerment service of soppeng regency, using a saturated sampling methodology involving the whole population as a sample, including 116 individuals. data collection techniques are focused on evaluation, interviews, questionnaires, and documentation. data analysis used multiple linear regressions for spss v.25 tools. the findings revealed that the empowerment policy in its execution wanted consistency, strong group engagement to support itself through empowerment and the reduction of disparities in society, empowerment policies through government- issued regulations that added significantly to sustainable development for the community.","empowerment policy, coordination, companion","This study's results can be inferred that empowerment policy seeks consistency in its execution. The active participation of the population in encouraging itself through empowerment, removing any imbalances in society, and assignment approaches through government-issued regulations contributes to the philosophy of sustainable growth. Empowerment policies that are well applied allow the group to be motivated, increase awareness, and improve its capability. The success of empowerment is accomplished by a high degree of public consciousness. Coordination of government agencies to create public awareness is a critical task. The instructor's consistency demonstrates that they are not only offering assistance regardless of the role given to them, but there is a challenge to how the group should be better motivated so that they can optimize themselves to accomplish what they desire. In comparison, a good- quality partner is to see that people are happy and more prosperous in their lives. The effects of empowerment carried out by trained partners will make the group more able to explore their abilities and be more motivated to become powerful and drive themselves in the best possible way.","community empowerment office suci dharma, hasmin tamsah and sitti mujahida baharuddin student of management magister program- postgraduate program sekolah tinggi ilmu ekonomi amkop makassar, indonesia saifuddin@gmail.com, hasmin@stieamkop.ac.id, mujahida.sitti20@gmail.com endy gunanto marsasi management department universitas islam indonesia, yogyakarta, indonesia endygunanto@yahoo.com saidna zulfiqar bin-tahir english education department universitas iqra buru, maluku, indonesia saidnazulfiqar@gmail.com herry fernandes butar butar politeknik ilmu pemasyarakatan butarbutarhf@poltekip.ac.id ambo upe department of sociology, halu oleo university ambo.upe@uho.ac.id",

Besides, it was possible to test and compare two selection methods used in the study. Both selection methods presented feasible solutions and it was possible to identify some differences between them. Considering the GA designed in this paper, the Tournament Selection method showed more stability between generations and was able to reach an optimal region earlier. The Fitness Proportionate Selection method had more variations through generations but was able to reach the best individual earlier than the Tournament Selection.

428,Simulation Improves Service And Resource Allocation At An  Automotive Garage,"discrete-event process simulation historically began its now long and distinguished “career” in support of manufacturing operations, ranging from assembly lines to make-to-order operations. from than auspicious beginning, it has expanded its usage to many other fields, such as warehousing, public transport (e.g., airports, bus terminals, railroads…), health care delivery (e.g., hospitals, clinics, urgent care centers, dental practices…), government functions (e.g., welfare administration, timing of traffic lights, courthouses…), and the service industry. service industry applications of simulation have included restaurants, retail stores, hotels, and drive-through oil change centers. in this paper, we describe the important and productive role of simulation in improving the service performance metrics and resource allocation within an automotive service center.","automotive repair, service industry","and Future Work Given these results, the simulation analysis team presented two highly promising choices to the garage management: 1. Recruit one more mechanic, keeping other specifications unchanged. 2. Recruit two more mechanics, keeping other specifications unchanged. Recommendation 1 was predicted to provide the following improvements: 1. Mechanic utilization would decrease from 91% to 80% (often considered “the ideal percent busy time” in operations research). 2. Time in system for all types of work would noticeably decrease: routine TIS from 1.47 hours to 1.00 hours; easy repair from 2.34 to 1.26 hours; small accident from 3.50 to 2.23 hours. 3. Average run time would decrease from 12.31 hours (work done about 8:20pm) to 10.42 hours (work done before 6:30pm). Recommendation 2 was predicted to provide the following improvements: 1. Mechanic utilization would decrease from 91% to 68% (somewhat lower than usually desired). 2. Time in system for all types of work would significantly decrease: routine TIS from 1.47 hours to 0.78 hours; easy repair from 2.34 to 1.05 hours; small accident from 3.50 to 1.98 hours. 3. Average run time would decrease from 12.31 hours (work done about 8:20pm) to 9.81 hours (work done shortly before 6pm), representing nearly two fewer hours of work daily. The garage management decided to implement the first recommendation – its advantages were better utilization of the skilled mechanics and its lower cost, since one fewer new mechanic would be hired. The mechanics (including the newly hired one) were moderately pleased at the prospect of finishing their daily work, on average, markedly sooner. This recommendation has now been in effect several months, and the predictions of the analysis have been fulfilled. Acknowledgments The authors gratefully acknowledge the cooperation and assistance of the automotive garage managers and workers in providing data, explaining details of the plant’s operation, and specifying the performance metrics of primary concern.","wenqi deng, yang yang, di zhao, and edward j williams business analytics, college of business, university of michigan – dearborn dearborn, mi, 48126, usa wenqid@umich.edu, umethan@umich.edu, dizhao@umich.edu, williame@umich.edu",
429,A Study About The Level Of Lean Usage In Plastic Industry,,,"This paper aims to study the deployment of Lean Production System principles, methodologies and tools in companies from the plastic sector in the region of Sorocaba, Brazil. To attend this objective, a questionnaire was applied to a set of eight professionals. Regarding the adoption of LPS, the questionnaire has proved to be useful in collecting detailed information about LPS implementation and use in companies of different sizes and organization. Despite the questionnaire being a bit long, its questions allowed to detect some contradictions in the answers that could expose the difference between intentions and actions of managers and companies. The analysis of the results demonstrated that the initial hypothesis (LPS would be known by plastic companies and used in different levels by them) is not true. This finding is very surprising because LPS principles, tools and methodologies are widely disclosed in Brazil since 1990’s. This disclosing happened not only in technical and academic environment, but in popular media as well. Of course, the discussion in popular media is not deep enough to modify a company but should be enough to call out the attention of managers and owners of companies that something new was happening.

431,Sustainability Best Practices For Oil And Gas Sector In  Mexico,"the objective of the research is to identify the best sustainability practices most used in companies in the oil and gas sector to reduce the environmental damages of their activities, in order to take them into account in mexico. the research is documentary, in which the leading companies in the oil and gas sector were considered as subjects of study based on their environmental performance and the development of substantive activities. the results presented are the best sustainability practices and the environmental impacts derived from the central activities of the oil and gas sector, as well as the mechanisms for implementing best sustainable practices in the case of mexico. there is evidence that companies in the sector invest in sustainability practices to improve their environmental performance, while continuing to obtain economic benefits, in the direction of low carbon economies, however, it is necessary to give greater impetus to renewable energy sources that have taken relevance in recent decades.",,"At international level, various groups, organizations and companies in the oil and gas sector have undertaken actions and new trends focused on reducing environmental impacts. One of the main actions is to reorient the conventional consumption and production of primary energy sources, moving from an economy of high CO2 emissions and other greenhouse pollutants, to a low carbon economy, making companies in the sector more responsible and sustainable In recent years, international initiatives and agreements, such as the “Zero Routine Flaring by 2030”, the “Paris Agreement” and the “SDGs of the 2030 Agenda”, have encouraged companies in the oil and gas sector towards implementation of best sustainability practices throughout its value chain, in order to contribute to its goals, so they turn out to be ideal channels for adoption. These channels are promoted by leading international organizations that group important companies, associations and governments in favor of the environment. Leading companies in the oil and gas sector, concerned and committed to environmental protection, including BP, ExxonMobil, Shell, Lukoil, PetroChina, Petrobras and Petronas, have designed and implemented best sustainability practices in the development of their substantive activities. In the case of Mexico, best sustainability practices are carried out in the oil and gas sector, although not all of the most representative of the sector, mostly through PEMEX, a state company that was in charge of the activities of the sector, exclusively, for more than 80 years, however, due to the opening of the sector to private companies, special attention will have to be given to new participants, since they represent an imminent risk of causing environmental impacts, so they will have to implement best sustainable practices and comply with environmental legislation at the national and international levels.

432,The Application Of Decision Tree Regression To Optimize  Business Processes,"many organizations use business processes as a tool to realize and sustain competitive advantage in the market. a business process is a structured collection of activities with comprehensible sequence and dependency to yield a required outcome. the optimization of these processes is of paramount importance because optimized processes yield adaptability, accurate information, enhanced efficiency, accountability through performance monitoring, and improved quality. relying on business people such as executives and management to identify areas of improvement in the business processes is potentially subjective. this research commences on the assumption that business processes are fully constituted for a business and on this premise seeks an alternate, none subjective, optimization technique. a decision tree (dt) is a tool that supports decision making by means of a tree-structured modeling approach to map possible outcomes of a chain of interconnected choices. when applied in statistical regression modeling, a dt model employs supervised learning techniques to model decisions in a tree structure with possible results, input costs, and usefulness. in a dt model, aspects of an element are monitored and the model is trained to predict the future. dt can be applied to improve business processes by identifying activities or elements with significant impact when enhanced. this paper demonstrates business process optimization via dt regression modeling by the use of python programming.","decision tree, python, standard deviation",This paper emphasizes the importance of business process optimization. The right techniques and tools are pivotal to achieve optimized business processes. DT regression model has proven to be efficient in using historical and present data to predict future outcome and provide best possible ways to execute business processes.

433,Digital Technologies And Artificial Intelligence For  Optimized Key Performance Indicators,"businesses define and manage key performance indicators (kpi’s). the most effective kpi’s for business optimization is the subject of various studies. various best practice bodies dedicate significant effort in defining smart kpi’s. the fourth industrial revolution (4ir) is able to digitalize the business so as to automate and collect data, facilitating digital constructs of defined kpi’s. 4ir introduces big data (bd), big data analytics (bda) and advanced data analytics (ada) for analyzing data collected from digital business integration. ada engine generates relationships between data never conceived historically. the ability of business to apply the theoretical correlations for business optimization is a contemporary challenge. artificial intelligence (ai) spawns mechanisms that enable machines to be intelligent enough to react like humans. however, there is a misalignment between kpi’s defined by organizations and those discovered by analytics. this research proposes an approach to synergizing and developing smart kpi’s by bringing together 4ir and traditional approaches.","industry 4.0, kpi, ai","and Future Research This paper emphasizes the importance of clearly defining business strategy, converting strategy into goals and objectives, managing and monitoring the company performance (i.e., goals and objectives) by implementing KPI’s. Moreover, the definitions and implementation of different AI and ADA statistical techniques are deliberated in detail. Consequently, the knowledge discovered creates the hypotheses that traditional, subjective KPI’s could be supplemented by the application of AI and digital technologies that in turn utilize ADA statistical techniques significantly. Synergizing traditional with 4IR centric KPI’s could reveal hidden patterns and relationships never conceived before in the organization. This research can be expanded into a case study where traditional, structured dataset is identified, copied to a different repository, and dismantled into unstructured data. AI and ADA statistical techniques could be applied on unstructured dataset in order to create optimized KPI’s and prove the theory presented in this paper.

435,Planning Support Tool For Torobayo Beer Production Using  System Dynamics,"we present a tool to support beer production planning for kunstmann company using system dynamics. a description of the production system was made, which served as base for the construction of the proposed model, through vensim software. storage for fermentation and conditioning in unit-tanks (uts), filtering and temporary storage in drunk- tanks (dts), packing and product inventory were studied. the proposed model includes 3 level variables (ut, dt and inventory) and 5 connected flows, taking into account the delays in the fermentation and maturation of beer, and the capacities of filtering, packaging and inventory. the process eventually stops when a desired inventory is reached. the structure described corresponds to the generic structure of a ut. by taking advantage of modeling with vensim´s subscripts, together with a disposition in a spreadsheet of few parameters, this structure was simplified to generate up to 12 uts in parallel. this tool allows those who carry out the planning work to test different scenarios and, particularly, to detect bottlenecks present in the dts, in an agile, faster, and graphic way. with this tool, the production planner could evaluate theoretical production scenarios changing the main parameters that define the entire process, improving company's decision making.","planning, beer, production, system dynamics","The tool presented in this work combines elements of modeling and simulation of the main variables involved in the Torobayo beer production process in conjunction with the changing data of the parameters used for decision making. The visualization of the main variables behavior that arises from the structure of the proposed model allows contextualizing the production planning discussion with the management and other departments of the company. Consequently, it considerably improves the understanding of the entire process and the communication between those involved. It is an appropriate tool, we believe, to provide skills to those who make planning decisions, by using simulations. In addition, its development is relatively fast, as it connects elements of System Dynamics with spreadsheets that are mostly used in the company. The first model is a simulator, while the second one, with the subscripts, is a graphics viewer of a proposed production schedule through an Excel spreadsheet, but considering the interrelation between variables, delays, etc., generating graphs easily understanding by staff. The tool proposed was validated, in part, by Cervecería Kunstmann staff, as well as via structural verification, dimensional consistency, and extreme conditions. Both models are equivalent and generate identical results. Therefore, the main product we present here is a tool, which is in its early stages but, we believe, can help planner to understand the complexity and think about planning process considering the relevant variables and parameters acting together, as well as to visualize the dynamics generated among them. This tool could be used for training purposes, for those who start working in the world of beer production, too.

441,The Escalation Of Commitment. An Empirical Case In  Colombia,"the objective of this research work is to describe the escalation of commitment, also known as a commitment bias, a phenomenon that is evidenced in the actors who make decisions in organizations, the government, among others. in order to make the behavior of escalation of commitment in the organization visible and to have the possibility of analyzing it in real situations, we designed and implemented an academic case on the actions that can take place in an organization, identifying the most relevant components of the literature that are part of this behavior. initially, a group of 464 people, with knowledge in administration and finance, were asked about the way in which they visualize the escalation of commitment in the proposed case and the most relevant attitudes associated to it; then, we analyzed which of the components are the ones that most influence the decision making of financial managers; and finally, what actions would be the best to implement with this behavior. the results of this work show that commitment escalation behaviors, as well as organizational behaviors, are more relevant and important for the group of older women than any other group of the population.","scale of commitment, business survival","Staw (2005, 1981, 1976) asserts that his appreciation of the escalation of commitment is an approach to the reality that is experienced within companies, and invites further investigation into the phenomenon through the understanding that “the dynamics of escalation can be a truly multilevel process that requires much more interdisciplinary thinking ... and that can be developed as a multilevel theorization in the field of organizational behavior” (Staw, 2005, p. 232). Similarly, it invites researchers to develop research ideas by observing the participation and decisions that actors make in the environment (Staw, 2005). He explains that the aim of the theory is to answer the question of “why” and it is strengthened and deepened by taking into account the connections of the phenomena. ""It is a story of the explanation of why certain events are acted out and take place, where the convincing and interconnected logic of arguments is the support of the theory, since a good theory explains and predicts"" (Staw, 2005, p. 235). In order to make a field study of the escalation in an organization, there are three key aspects must be taken into account in the presentation of an escalation: 1) an ongoing decision, 2) negative or ambiguous feedback, and 3) opportunity to commit additional resources over the time (Staw, 2005) In the case of the escalation of commitment and its application, different applications at the business level have been found, such as the case of the investigation on the decisions of local and international investors carried out by Devigne, Manigart, and Wright (2016). This study investigates the differences between local and foreign investors when investing in venture capital. The research focuses on determining the influence of emotional, social, and institutional factors on an unsuccessful investment, the sample was 1,060 investors in 684 European technology companies. The results show that national investors have a high tendency to intensify their commitment, while investors outside their border have a lower social and emotional involvement in the project and a lower entrenchment in the local economic and social environment. In addition, investors tend to avoid the completion of failed projects; they increase their commitment and continue to invest, even though the information shows that the investment does not meet the expectations. This is surprising, as venture capital firms protect themselves against this kind of decision bias. First, investment and termination decisions typically require approval by one or more investment committees, rather than by an individual.

449,Challenges To Apply Lean Methodology And Logistics To Coordinate  Distribution Management,": lean six sigma and logistics associated with business-to-business transactions have changed the way the warehouse and distribution systems operate. small and medium enterprises (smes) in developing countries face problems in coordinating the lean application and distribution logistics due to lack of resources and improper directions. the purpose of this paper is to develop a framework to enhance the effective use of warehouse systems and develop a matrix to improve productivity. the coordination matrix includes the structural relationship among different factors of lean improvement and logistics tools, which is responsive to distribution logistics strategic decision making. a total of 20 enablers for lean and logistics for coordination of distribution management have been identified based on the best practices and literature reviews. these factors are grouped into five categories, such as waste control, flow management, quality assurance, warehouse operations smoothness, and continuous improvement. the paper has explored the major factors for coordination of the lean and logistics simultaneously to gain potential benefits in distribution management. it will be of great value for smes in developing their strategies for coordination in distribution planning.","lean methodology, logistics, smes, brazil",,,
