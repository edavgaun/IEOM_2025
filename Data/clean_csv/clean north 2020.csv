0,Location Of A Temporary Site To Earthquake Waste  Separation. Case Study: Mexico City,"given the high probability of occurrence of environmental disasters in mexico, it is necessary to have emergency and response plans that attend the most urgent needs of the victims, as well as the subsequent recovery and reconstruction processes of the affected areas. after the 2017 earthquake in mexico city, the project “earthquake waste management proposal in mexico city” was launched, which includes the removal of waste from the disaster site to a temporary site separation, which is a temporary storage and waste classification site before being sent to their respective recycling chains or for their proper final disposal. the selection of optimal locations for temporary sites is important for efficient management of the supply chain and humanitarian logistics. this work presents the optimal location of the temporary site based on the transportation model of mixed integer linear programming, which evaluates the average distance between the collapse points caused by the earthquake (demand) and the sites authorized by the government of the mexico city, to select n temporary sites (facilities) whose distance must be minimal. all above is necessary, in order to achieve the reduction of risks to public health and support the efficient management of waste for their proper recycling or final disposal. the methodology of the present study includes the application of the transportation model, case study earthquake of september 19th, 2017 in mexico city, considering next constraints: 14 collapse buildings, 8 possible sites according to official data provided, 46 439 m3 (11 482 ton) earthquake waste generation according with previous estimations by the same project and the location of a single temporary site. the results show that the minimum total distance between each origin point and the temporary site is 534.29 km. the minimum distance traveled between the points of origin and destination is 51% less than that of the farthest site, while it is 7.95% less than that of the next nearest site. the study concludes that the location of temporary waste separation sites through the proposed model contributes to the planning of pre-disaster actions. it is necessary to continue working on this issue to increase the resilience of mexico city and in the long term of other vulnerable municipalities of the country.",,,"adriana guadalupe aguilar montoya ángel leonardo bañuelos saucedo flor hernández padilla mechanical and industrial engineering division school of engineering national autonomous university of mexico, mexico city. adriana.agmt@gmail.com, anleba17@hotmail.com, florhp@comunidad.unam.mx",
1,Factors Influencing Transport Productivity Of A Freight   Transport Company,"the purpose of this paper is to examine what are main factors influencing trucks productivity of a freight transport company in mexico. this study employed factor analysis to determine if there were a relationship between variables and multiple regression analysis to determine which factors had significant impact in delivery times. data collected were analyzed using spss 23. regarding factor analysis, it was used kayser-meyer-olkin test to prove if a factorial analysis could be performed, resulting in reduction of variables from 7 to 2 – with a kmo of 0.91 the results are suitable for factor analysis – and bartlett’s sphericity test to test resulting in 0.0 – which means data structure is suitable – indicating factor analysis and data are useful to achieve research objective. hence, this study is the base to improve service quality and client perception, by increasing number of fulfilled deliveries. this research is important for the company since it will provide insights about the performance of their logistics process and variables to be controlled to improve trucks efficiency and productivity.","freight transport, factor analysis, anova","and Recommendations This study recommended that company should pay special attention to maintenance, since it is the factor affecting meaningfully the supply chain performance of the logistics company from the case study. Hence, in order to reduce those times, it is important to implement a preventive maintenance program, which should be planned to be carried out when equipment has low utilization due to low demand, also, make a general check to the trucks with highest idle times in order to focus in the reduction of idle time to improve equipment productivity. Also, the analysis and classification of truck types by age should be performed, so they oldest can be assigned to flat routes where their performance cannot be reduced by type of road and service can be performed efficiently. Moreover, it is important to standardize truck logs to reduce data manipulation manually, since all data had to be cleaned before any analysis could be performed, which reduces visibility of logistics issues to make decisions regarding any route, impacting negatively in customer service level and reaction times are longer, increasing delivery times and, consequently, impacting manufacturing times from customers. Hence, it should be implemented KPIs to measure process efficiency regarding maintenance and equipment utilization.","felix eduardo bueno pascual felixeduardo.bueno@upaep.edu.mx josé luis martínez flores joseluis.martinez01@upaep.mx santiago omar caballero morales santiagoomar.caballero@upaep.mx school of logistics and supply chain management universidad popular autónoma de puebla avenida 9 poniente 1712, c.p. 72410, puebla, puebla, méxico luis alberto barroso moreno universidad de las américas puebla. ex hacienda sta. catarina mártir s/n. san andrés cholula, puebla. c.p. 72810. méxico luis.barroso@udlap.mx",

5,The Importance Of Post-Mortems In Construction Projects,"organisations in the construction industry are frequently faced with the challenges of not achieving the set targets with reference to late project completions, exceeding the budget and undesirable quality of work due to poor workmanship. the global financial challenges have encouraged numerous organizations to investigate the possibilities of improving the delivery of their products and services. consequently, clients in the construction industry require more efficient management of projects and services to meet project objectives; and including post-mortems as best practice allow organisations to further enhance the successful management of future projects. this paper describes a study carried out to explore the key factors and benefits of effective and successful project post-mortems for organisations in the construction industry. for this, a quantitative methodological approach employing a structured closed-ended research instrument as a data source was followed. the findings identified people and systems related factors that contribute to successful and effective project post mortems for organisations in construction environment. the study further identified the benefits organisations can gain from successful project post-mortems.","construction, lessons, post-mortems, effective",", the study recommends that organisations must consider investing on improving their knowledge management systems and implementation thereof, to ensure that organisations learn from mistakes. A key outcome of any project post-mortem lies in motivating the project team by also recognising and rewarding the team’s successes. Future research to be conducted to test the findings obtained by comparing two or more organisations that conducts projects in the construction industry. It would be interesting for future research to analyse the application of project post-mortems by different organisations within the construction industry. Further research may follow a case study approach with both a questionnaire and interviews in the research to better understand how organisations facilitate and incorporates project post mortems to perform better in future projects. 5.7 Validation The study used content validation through extensive literature review and the questionnaire were adopted from the existing sources. The adequacy of the data collection tools was further confirmed using face validation. Further, theoretical validation was conducted on the study results by comparing the findings against the findings of other researchers from literature. 6. Conclusion The objectives of this research were to identify the key factors that lead to an effective and successful project post mortem for organisations in construction environment and identify the benefits of a successful project post-mortem. A closed-ended questionnaire was developed to address the objectives of this research. The people-related and systems-related factors as well as the benefits of a successful project post-mortem were identified. The people-related factors such as learning from mistakes, communication and common understanding, teamwork, top management support and commitment, technical support from experience individuals, active participation by clients/project owners, trust, willingness to share information and incentive and reward initiatives were identified as contributing to the effectiveness and successful project post mortems. Information technology, procedures/standards, workshops/project assessment, information capturing database and lessons learnt registers are the systems related factors used by organisations for effective and successful post-mortems. Further, cross-collaboration and increased customer relations, cost reduction and time savings, better decision making, active participation by all stakeholders, improved communication, reflection and closure on project, improved productivity and continuous learning are the key benefits that organisations can benefit from successful project post mortems. The research found that project post mortems is a beneficial tool and methods by which organisations can learn and improve its capabilities to achieve accomplish better results in future projects.

6,Quality And Reliability Analysis Of Long-Hole Stope Slots: A  Case Study At South Deep Gold Mine Based On Drilling And,"despite a noticeable decline in the south african mining industry, opportunities still exist to exploit the current resources. curbing the devastating effects of this decline and the job losses would necessitate a change in approach; to one that promotes safe and profitable mining, to enable consistent product development or service reliability. manufacturing methodologies such as lean six sigma and theory of constraints were adopted to demonstrate the slot raising in long-hole stoping mining. slot raise is the critical long-hole stope stage, that if effectively executed warrants optimal extraction of the planned reserves. challenges with achieving the consistent performance of long- hole stopes performances were experienced to have been a major challenge at south deep contributing to poor slot raise establishment often leading to re-work. hence, it was prudent to consider improvement interventions to reduce wastage and promote good recoveries. improvements of 16% were attained from slot compliance from 56% in 2019 to 73% for the same period in 2020. these resulted from the design modifications through improvements in current slot patterns’ void ratios. process refinements from rigour tracking and leadership-driven performance ensured the right levels of accountability and sustainability of outcomes.","mining, slot raise, lean six sigma, quality","This study provided insights on the current slot processes and an appreciation of Lean Six Sigma combined with the theory of constraints methodologies.

7,Critical Success Factors As Enablers To Achieve Quality  Management System Benefits: An Engineering,"the research identified benefits that are associated with implementing the iso 9001:2015 quality management system as well as the critical success factors required to realise the benefits. organisations often successfully implement the quality management system but fail to unlock benefits that are beyond achieving formal certification of the system such as reduced defects and improved internal communication. the study identified benefits associated with implementing a quality management system and grouped them as primary, secondary, and tertiary. furthermore, twenty-one critical success factors have been identified that benefit the success of a quality management system. the research presents the findings of the case study which evaluated the existence of the critical success factors as well as their effectiveness in realising the benefits that the quality management system offers. the research benefits organisations who plan to adopt the system as well as those who aim to improve their implemented system utilising the identified success factors.",,"The effectiveness and existence of critical success factors in the identified QMS were evaluated against the list generated from the literature review and the summarised findings were as follows; leadership involvement, availability of resources, intentional continuous improvement, auditing and external pressure were found to be evident in this system and had the most impact while working environment and aligning company practices with ISO QMS were least verifiable factors in the system. The research findings indicate that a quality management system is beneficial for organisations and offers benefits that are beyond achieving certification, provided the organisation adopts practices such as taking time to develop procedures that are a reflection of how the work is carried out and procedures that allow for all crucial information to be captured when clarifying the scope and work to be done. Furthermore, continuous improvement of the twenty-one critical success factors is important to both the implementation and development of the quality management system. It is recommended that further research be conducted to verify the applicability of the findings made by this research on other organisations with certified quality management systems that have remained in existence for a period longer than three years. 6.

8,Application Of The Delphi Technique To Improve The  Implementation Of Cost Of Quality In Industry,"cost of quality (coq) has become a familiar concept across industries and its’ popularity is evident in the number of featured international academic publications. this research utilized previously published work, action research and the delphi technique to identify the activities required to plan, execute, check and improve a coq implementation program. action research was facilitated through a series of brainstorming sessions with seven researchers from the university of johannesburg. the delphi technique was conducted in three stages: during the first stage experts were identified and invited to partake in the study, and during stages, two to three the research questions were distributed to the select participants and agreement amongst the experts was assessed. the study identified the following important activities required to plan a coq program, namely the quantification of errors in financial terms; the development of a coq management policy; definition of roles and responsibilities and a rewards and recognition system; specification of the attainable coq targets and key performance indicators; and identification of the stakeholder reporting requirements. the research contributes to the current body of knowledge of cost of quality by identifying the activities needed to plan and implement a coq program in the industry.","cost of quality, evans and badar, but with time","The study identified from the literature the factors affecting the implementation of CoQ and employed action research to map the factors in the PDCA cycle. Consequently, action research identified a list of activities that could improve the planning, execution, monitoring and improvement of the CoQ program; and the Delphi technique was used to validate the results of the action research based on expert opinions. The Delphi technique consisted of two rounds and the panel of experts reached a consensus on 11 items (7 planning and 4 execution). To plan the CoQ program, we concluded that companies should consider quantifying quality errors in financial terms; develop a cost of quality management policy; define roles and responsibilities; define a rewards and recognition program; define the clear and attainable cost of quality targets and identify the reporting needs of stakeholders and specifying the leading and lagging key performance indicators (KPI). To implement the COQ program, the expert panel acknowledged that companies should consider collecting feedback from customers; provide regular feedback to stakeholders, gather performance-related information and monitor performance trends. Despite the high rating of items, the checking and improvement phase of the PDCA cycle did not reach an agreement.

9,Applications Of Lean Manufacturing In A Manufacturing  Company In South Africa,"manufacturing is one of the most important sectors in the south african economy. the paper examines the use of lean manufacturing tools in the context of south african manufacturing. to gain an in-depth understanding of the application of lean manufacturing tools in south africa, the research used a case study as the research method. questionnaires and operational data were used to determine the type of waste generated by the case study company, as well as the most used lean manufacturing tools for waste management. the study findings identified defects, inventory, transportation, waiting, and unused people's ideas as all have an impact on the company’s performance. transportation, defects, and inventory wastes were found to have a high main interaction effect with the paint line, anti-intrusion box line and bogie fitting line as some of the highly affected areas. the research also found 5s, standard work, and kanban as the most used lean manufacturing tools. the findings of the study can help the case study company's leaders to identify performance gaps and improve lean manufacturing implementation.","manufacturing, quality management, type of wastes",,"mpho karen masemola, bheki makhanya and hannelie nel department of engineering management university of johannesburg johannesburg, south africa bsm3174@yahoo.com; hannelien@uj.ac.za",
10,Application Of Fuzzy Logic For Evaluation Of The Level Of  Social Acceptance Of Traffic Noise Pollution Reduction,"traffic noise pollution is a huge issue throughout the world, especially in urban areas. traffic noise pollution can cause serious health issues including headaches, nausea, irritability, and insomnia. it can also cause a lower percentage of intellectual development in children’s brains after long-term exposure when compared to a quiet environment. solutions to this problem have been implemented in the past and many options have been proposed. however, the social aspect of the solutions is also important. these social indicators are often qualitative and thus difficult to measure. this paper presents the application of fuzzy logic, to evaluate the social acceptance of different noise reduction strategies in the region of western new york (wny). a questionnaire was utilized to collect data for the region. the created fuzzy model was verified using the questionnaire filled out by residents of wny. the results gained from the developed fuzzy model showed that the highest level of social acceptance is for planting trees at 61.30% and the lowest level of social acceptance is for traffic/transportation restrictions at 22.10%.","noise pollution, social acceptance, fuzzy set theory","This study uses the developed fuzzy model to evaluate the level of social acceptance of certain noise reduction methods by two input variables. The study showed that fuzzy set theory and fuzzy logic can provide an approach to deal with uncertainty in determining social indicators. The level of social acceptance obtained from the fuzzy model indicates that people have common knowledge and experience of the function of planting trees to reduce noise and they can easily accept this method depending on both effectiveness and cost. For the methods of quieter road surfaces, building walls, and traffic/transportation restrictions, some of the respondents are not clear with the actual effectiveness of these methods and the high cost. Uncertain effectiveness may make them consider that these methods are not worth investing in, which could cause low social acceptance. Some of the limitations in this study include the small number of respondents and the small age ranges of respondents. 26 respondents are insufficient, and most respondents are 24 and 25 years old who may have less knowledge and 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% Build walls Quieter road surfaces Plant trees Traffic/Transportation restrictions Cost Effectiveness Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management Monterrey, Mexico, November 3-5, 2021","strategies in western new york daxing zhao, zichuan liu, anthony runk, johnson adebayo fadeyi department of industrial & systems engineering university at buffalo buffalo, ny 14260 daxingzh@buffalo.edu; zichuanl@buffalo.edu; aarunk@buffalo.edu; jfadeyi@buffalo.edu","References

11,The Optimization Of An Electric Vehicle (Ev)   For Improved Range,"this study focuses on possible factors affecting an electric vehicle (ev) in “real world” testing. factors such as wind, temperature, and humidity were considered in testing range. a base model 2017 nissan leaf ev was modified to remove weight through altering wheel rims and car seats. removing weight from a vehicle has been used in car racing for many years to increase vehicle speed. through past studies focusing on new teslas (ev), wheel rim structure has been found to increase range. increasing the ev range through the removal of weight was thought to be possible. in addition, the nissan leaf was recharged while hot air was pumped underneath (for one hour from a clothes dryer) to increase battery capacity thereby adding extra kilometers to the range. there was an increase in range through recharging after the trial ended that day, it was aided by the hot air. a minimal gain in range was found after the third set of trials where weight was removed. future research should look at pumping hot air underneath the ev (for multiple hours) while recharging during cold weather (under 0 c/32 f) to find a solution for reduced range during colder months.","electric vehicle, nissan leaf, electrification, short-range","EVs are now a viable option for traveling short and long distances in North America. Battery capacity is improving on a continual basis. However, the construction of the actual EV needs to be rethought to gain additional range efficiencies. A five-kilometer addition in range, with minimal design changes, can mean the difference from making it to a recharging area or not. Practical heating options for keeping batteries warm during recharging in the fall, spring, and winter need to be researched. Since EVs are a relatively new area of study, there are many opportunities for future research in the “real world.” More trials need to be conducted over a longer time to get improved results. Future research should focus on adding a heating source under the car while recharging for all 4.5 hours (using a Level 2 charger) to extend range in the winter. Research using used EVs with altered wheel rims, including an “aero style”, like some Teslas use, should be tried and tested to see if added range is gained. Different materials that remove weight from an EV need to be tested so range can be extended without additional battery upgrades. EVs are different than ICE vehicles and their design materials need to be updated.","douglas w.e. ferrier college of technology indiana state university terre haute, in 47809, usa dferrier@sycamores.indstate.edu dr. patrick appiah-kubi program director, cloud computing & computer networking cybersecurity department school of cybersecurity & information technology university of maryland global campus patrick.appiahkubi@umgc.edu",
12,Iiot And Assisted Reality:  Re-Shaping Traditional Robotic Cells,"older generation robot-based production lines necessitate the adaptation to industry 4.0 standards for smart manufacturing within the factory. combining assisted reality technology with industrial internet of things (iiot) networking systems into a robotic manufacturing cell enables communication of critical data to any individual, independently of the human’s state. through assisted reality, the human is unencumbered by a tablet, laptop, or human-machine interface and free to navigate other tasks, while passively monitoring the progress of the production cell. this paper presents the integration of assisted reality and iiot into an older generation robotic cell. the robustness of the iiot application is validated through the integration of a diversified range of devices. these devices include an older generation industrial robot, a modern programmable logic controller, a raspberry pi embedded system, a series of external digital devices, an industrial analog weight sensor and a custom designed low-cost analog opacity sensor. a system was developed to prove the feasibility of modernizing an older generation robotic cell without altering its technology. the system was tested under multiple conditions, involving data passing through the iiot, and was found to be reliable in reporting statistics and adapting to user input for 1 hour or 50 cycles.","industry 4.0, hippmann","IIoT was integrated with standard industrial sensors, custom designed sensors, an older generation robot, a modern PLC, and a pair of AR glasses. Production data was successfully accessed and displayed to a human, without the need for a traditional HMI setup. In addition, simple two-way human-robot non-contact interaction was achieved through AR. These outcomes show promise for using Siemens MindSphere and Vuzix AR glasses together on large- scale industrial operations. The proof of concept presented in this paper validates the opportunity for companies to join Industry 4.0, independent of the type of data, technology, and age of the system. In addition, this paper proves that an old system can be updated to reap the advantages of IIoT information networks. The project team was tasked with using a robot that was designed and manufactured before the standard integration of IoT in industrial settings, and through research proved the feasibility and merit of upgrading a dated robot to the age of Industry 4.0. By integrating IIoT-compatible devices at every step of the manufacturing process, companies can collect massive amounts of data both instantaneously and autonomously, creating a network of information that can then be data-mined to assist in making specific decisions. These decisions can range from immediate manufacturing maintenance adjustments such as rerouting production lines to exclude a broken machine, to very long-term investment strategy moves based on overall efficiency of production lines.

13,The Use Of Electric Cars In Short-Notice Evacuations: A  Case Study Of California’S Natural Disasters,"as electric vehicles (evs) become more widely adopted by consumers, their use in emergency evacuation situations becomes a more relevant challenge. short-notice evacuations, such as those caused by wildfires and earthquakes, may lead to stall-outs, resulting in increased traffic and accidents. to avoid this, ev charging stations need to be located far enough away from emergency sites but within the range of an average charge to prevent stall-outs. california is the state that has the largest number of evs and the largest number of wildfires annually. the objective of this study is to analyze the state of california’s current ev charging capacity in emergency situations by applying existing methodology while focusing on a new aspect.","electric vehicles, simulation, california, evacuations","As expected, more publicly available charging stations need to be added in any scenario. What was surprising what that no level 3 chargers would need to be added to accommodate the evacuation of 40% of EVs in the city. This leads to the assumption that if less than 40% of the population of Santa Rosa needed to evacuate from a fire in 2035, the current level of publicly available charging stations would most likely be sufficient to support all residents safely evacuating, indicating that Santa Rosa is already in a good position to support electric vehicle evacuations. Although the initial objective of this model was to determine the minimum number of charging stations that would need to be added to safely evacuate all EVs, it was found that to get the minimum number, they would need to all be level 3 charging stations. Level 3 charging stations are much more expensive than level 2 charging stations and put a greater burden on the electric grid, which is not a good thing in evacuation scenarios. Instead, an even balance of Level 2 and Level 3 chargers was found to help alleviate this issue. Once the optimal number of publicly available charging stations has been identified, the next step is to identify where these new charging stations should be located. By looking at traffic patterns, proximity to neighborhoods and freeways, and the locations of currently existing charging stations, a simulation could be developed to find the optimal placement for the new charging stations. Additionally, further study into the everyday needs of publicly available charging stations in California under Governor Newsom’s executive order could be investigated as well.","roxanne peterson and mohamed a. awwad industrial and manufacturing engineering department california polytechnic state university, san luis obispo san luis obispo, ca 93407, usa rpeter20@calpoly.edu, mawwad@calpoly.edu",

15,The Accuracy Of Dynamic Simulation With The Use Of Tsb  Within Jack Siemens Plm Software,"we successfully evaluated the accuracy of full-body dynamic simulation with the use of tsb within jack siemens plm software via analyzing the common lifting and carrying tasks. the deviation of joint angles between the real and predicted human movement directly resulted in the significant difference of lumbar forces imposed on participants. these joint deviations were provided as references for ergonomists and engineers to manually manipulate the joints on digital human models to achieve accurate dynamic simulation. in this study, we also revealed the effect of muscle strength between genders on the motion of shoulders, and the effect of different loads on the adoption of postures. to lower the workers’ injury rates, software manufacturers have to continue their efforts to improve products for robust ergonomics analysis.","posture evaluation, over 900","that a small deviation of joint manipulation can result in a large impact on the forces (Chaffin 2005). In our study, the average maximum Compressive forces of males were less than the safety standard 3400N as they lifted a 5kg load, but nearly all males were exposed to the peak A/P Shear force greater than 700N (Waters et al. 1993). The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health [NIOSH] has provided the maximum lifting weight at 50 pounds (approximate 22.7kg). Any deviation of joint manipulation in TSB dynamic simulation may cause the inaccurate assessment of injury risk during workers’ daily activities. For Task 2 as the participants carried a load forward, although nearly all joints (except the Elbow_R_F/E) had significant difference between the Predicted_HM and Real_HM, the deviation of Hip_F/E (approximate 17°) could be the primary factor, which resulted in the statistical difference of lumbar forces. Moreover, it is noteworthy that the participants extended their shoulders to keep the load close to their bodies in the Real_HM. However, in the TSB Predicted_HM, the shoulder’s movement of DHM was flexion. Also, as the load was increased from 5kg to 10kg, there was no change of the predicted full-body postures in TSB. However, in reality, the shoulders and trunk should be extended more to maintain body balance as the load increased. This hypothesis could be verified by the study (Attwells et al. 2006). It indicated that the trunk significantly flexed forward as the load of backpack increased. Besides, in our study the females had greater shoulder extension and elbow flexion than the males in the Real_HM. If considering the difference of muscle strength between genders (Stoll et al. 2000), their performances should not be identical in the Predicted_HM. These limitations in TSB will cause the inaccurate evaluation on the muscle fatigue and joint strength capability. 5. Conclusion We successfully evaluated the accuracy of full-body dynamic simulation with the use of TSB within JACK Siemens PLM software via analyzing the common lifting and carrying tasks. In this study, nearly all joints were significantly different in the Predicted_HM as compared with the Real_HM. These joint deviations directly resulted in the significant difference of lumbar forces imposed on participants. Although our results greatly help ergonomists and engineers fully understand the deviation of DHM predicted postures in dynamic simulation compared with the actual human movement, the long-term goal for human dynamic simulation requires the minimum manually joint manipulation on DHM. Particularly, in the scenario of not recording the real human performance, the software still can achieve accurate posture prediction.

16,Simulation Of Texture Geometries To Optimize  Tribological Properties.,"surface texturing is a process that enhances the tribological properties of different materials. this topic has been widely studied because it is a tool that saves resources such as materials, money, and time. to obtain the most useful set of parameters to get the smallest coefficient of friction (cof), several simulations in the program comsol were made, varying depth, width, texture density and oil film thickness. design of experiments with the methodology of box behnken was applied through minitab to reduce the number of simulations that had to be performed (from 81 to 27 runs), and to identify the most significant parameter that provided a lower cof. minitab showed that every input parameter (oil film thickness, width, depth, % textured area) has an important role for reducing cof, being the most important the lubricant film thickness. the results showed us improvements depending on the lubrication regime ranging from 60% and 95% where the greatest decreases in cof were observed in boundary lubrication conditions. this demonstrates the importance of texturing for reducing the cof in tribological tests and the potential it has for manufacturing processes, as well as the use of simulation programs to help reduce the consumption of laboratory resources. a design guide was made including minitab and comsol for different manufacturing processes considering boundary, mixed and hydrodynamic lubrication.","surface texturing, simulation","In this project we carried out a simulation of the tribological test T-05 through COMSOL (Thin-Film Flow), then we carried out a Design of Experiments (Box Bhenken) that later we analyzed statistically by Minitab, both were Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management Monterrey, Mexico, November 3-5, 2021","adrián rodríguez, luisa martínez, luis miranda school of engineering and technologies universidad de monterrey san pedro garza garcía, n.l. 66238, méxico adrianm.rodriguez@udem.edu, luisa.martinezm@udem.edu, luis.mirandac@udem.edu laura peña-parás, santiago cruz and demófilo maldonado department of mechanical and electronic engineering universidad de monterrey san pedro garza garcía, n.l. 66238, méxico laura.pena@udem.edu, jose.cruz@udem.edu, demofilo.maldonado@udem.edu martha rodríguez-villalobos department of physics and mathematics universidad de monterrey san pedro garza garcía, n.l. 66238, méxico martha.rodríguezv@udem.edu","References

17,Diffusion Of Facilities Management In An Emerging Market:  Case Of Sri Lanka,this research aims to identify the facilities management diffusion model in an emerging market taking sri lanka as a case. the purpose was to identify its diffusion model with special features that can advance the diffusion of innovation (doi) theory. the research took a pragmatist paradigm and was conducted through a mixed-method approach. it took a quantitative approach from a positivist point of view for a deductive theoretical approach to finding the nature of fm diffusion in sri lanka based on current innovation diffusion theories. a qualitative approach was used in parallel for a deeper understanding of the unique context being studied. facilities management is being adopted in sri lanka in its generic definition with minimum re-invention. a higher education institute has played the role of principal change agent while being an education innovator. theoretical change agents have had an insignificant role. several unique features had contributed to diffusion efficiency. the diffusion model can be employed by both higher education institutes and authorities to introduce new professions or practices to a new market effectively. the study concludes with a unique innovation diffusion model that has shown its success. it shows how a higher education institute plays a key change agent role in the diffusion of a new professional. a similar innovation model has not previously been reported.,"diffusion, sri lanka","Innovation diffusion studies are about how new ideas spread in communities or markets. FM is relatively new to Sri Lanka and not many organisations have adopted it. This makes it an ideal innovation to understand the diffusion model and its special features at the early stage of its diffusion. A study with a mixed-method research design was conducted with an online questionnaire among practicing top management of Facilities Managers in Sri Lanka. The study showed that FM in Sri Lanka is in its Early Adopter phase and has already started to diffuse in Sri Lanka but still at a slow rate. Feedback of current adopters was positive, and a majority of early adopters will embrace FM with ease creating momentum for sustainable adoption. Re-invention of FM as innovation will be minimum, a large majority will adopt FM in its current definition. Engagement of FM in its full scope is emerging, involvement during all stages of buildings from design to demolition is observed. All main functions of FM are performed, though at varying degrees. No standardisation was identified in the innovation packaging of FM delivery, and Facilities Managers are supposed to have all-round competencies. The University of Moratuwa has offered both awareness and trialability of FM and has played the role of principal change agent while been an education innovator. Interestingly, theoretical change agents have had an insignificant role in FM diffusion in Sri Lanka. The study concludes with a unique innovation diffusion model that has shown its success. It is a case that a higher education institute playing a key change agent role in the diffusion of a new professional. The inherent characteristic of a profession-oriented study programme that requires student interaction with the industry creates initial awareness, and industry internships offer trialability of innovation. Challenge for the graduate to find employment further disseminates awareness. Theorized competencies offered in the profession-oriented degree make relatively homogeneous adoption of the new profession with minimum re-invention at early stages that minimises the chances of failure.

18,Mobile Application Design For Managing Preventive  Maintenance Information For Neonatal Respirators,"this research study proposes a new alternative for monitoring and managing maintenance work in neonatal respiratory equipment at the edgardo rebagliati martins general hospital, a general health facility in lima, peru. this proposal is based on a mobile vision optical character recognition (ocr) algorithm, which identifies the numerical code of each device in the field through an android mobile application. this information is then processed using a weibull model to determine equipment failure probabilities. based on the mean times between failures collected from history information, the system calculates the current failure probabilities for each device. these probabilities are recalculated every time the equipment is scanned. this paper describes the variables used, obtaining an 88% accuracy when using the ocr system, thus identifying preventive maintenance needs from device information.",,"Among our conclusions, we can mention that this study focused on improving the maintenance management of neonatal equipment using an OCR algorithm to capture the numerical codes associated to each device, thus automating the existing manual process that hindered adequate equipment monitoring. The OCR recognition algorithm was 88% effective in identifying the numerical codes printed or written on device labels, detailing device information, and calculating their failure probability to anticipate possible maintenance actions. As part of the research study, information was collected from six machines, identifying premature failures in all of them. This evidences the usefulness of the Weibull model to represent lifespan expectancies for neonatal ventilators. This behavior can then help take action with other ventilation equipment. To reduce initial failure risks for these machines, device information must be recorded as they are commissioned, and their failure probabilities must be compared against the values accepted by the people in charge of the maintenance management process. For the equipment assessed, this value was set at 90%. Future lines of research must be related to using remote operation sensors to monitor device operation indicators to create an indicator dashboard.","jhonatan junnior anaya medina, diego daniel martínez calderón universidad de lima, escuela de ingeniería y arquitectura lima, perú 20122496@aloe.ulima.edu.pe , 20121932@aloe.ulima.edu.pe josé antonio taquía gutiérrez universidad de lima, instituto de investigación científica, grupo de investigación en tecnologías exponenciales, grupo de investigación en economía circular, carrera de ingeniería industrial. lima, perú jtaquia@ulima.edu.pe",

20,Statistical Analysis Methods Changed From Traditional To  A Continuous Annealing Heat Treatment In A Copper,"the result of this research changed the traditional annealing heat treatment to a continuous annealing heat treatment process in a copper wire drawn machine with benefits in efficiency, quality, wip and energy consumption. increasing temperatures above 500ºc in the segment of the annealing process in a copper wire drawn machine by keeping elongation results matching the technical specifications using statistical analysis tools and comparing the relationship between the values and behavior of the copper stretched with pulleys during the continuous annealing process in a copper wire drawn machine. these changes reduced at least forty-eight hours from the original process by avoiding the traditional annealing heat treatment. applying the factorial analysis method reduced the number of significant factors that represents the relationship of the independent variables as well as a multiple regression analysis were identified establishing the parameters to operate a continuous annealing process. more than 3,000 observations were computed, the study significantly identifies two important components whose initial eigenvalues are greater than 1 and together reach a cumulative intercorrelation of 90.686%. the kmo index indicates a high correlation of 0.718 and bartlett's sphericity with a significance value of 0.000 and rotation method varimax with normalization kaise the second factor is most highly correlated with electric charge and elongation.","annealing, elongation","Eliminate the traditional annealing heat treatment by a continuous heat treatment in a copper wire drawn machine it is possible, see Figure 4, the new drawn wire process by placing a 35KW transformer plus changing voltage from 220 to 440V. The main reason is to increase temperature of the copper wire above 500°C without affecting the physicochemical properties of the material, production speed and complying with the NMX-J-036-ANCE- 2017 standard. Adjusting the electrical load, it is critical in a continuous annealing heat treatment and the only way to find the right values is by using statical analysis tools which compares the relationship between the variables and the behavior of the copper stretched. Various positive aspects can be found ones the improvements were placed. Main benefits 1. Inventory reduction in process 1.3 tons, 2. Reduction in the electric consumption in 15 KW every two days, 3. Eliminate electric oven, 4. No more consumption of nitrogen gas. Furthermore, applying the statistical methodology improves the parameters of annealing by combining different variables in the copper wire drawn process. In this case, for each solution studied, some series are proposed of behavioral verification constraints that are the same as the process. For future analysis, copper wire from other suppliers should be included to establish several supply alternatives and validate the electric charge-speed model. Industrial processes in SMEs are usually carried out manually based on some theoretical calculations and according to the experience of the operator. It is generally difficult to optimize it due to the impossibility of measuring all the parameters that influence the process, such as the internal stress to which the wire is subjected. In addition, this adjustment analysis needs the process to be stopped, which is a serious inconvenience for production. Supporting SMEs to reduce their costs by improving their manufacturing processes guarantees their positioning in the market and the viability of the company.

28,"A Study Of Community Empowerment Strategy For  Vulnerable Groups In Eradicating Poverty At Aceh Province,","women are one of the vulnerable groups that needed to empower and always discussed in many spaces. this study tried to identify the lack of women backed by structural problems in village policies that do not consider women as a class of vulnerable groups become the most crucial part of development. qualitative research with natural methods because it is on the basis of natural conditions. this approach is focusing on phenomena or natural settings. the data is collected by interviewing and observing a member of the empowerment and family welfare group (pkk). this study found that mothers of households who serve as household heads trained to take advantage of what they must earn additional income. pkk group pioneered the village's opposition by involving themselves completely, both from development planning, implementation to the evaluation of performance already underway. the empowerment efforts are not arbitrarily successful as expected; the pkk group is precisely dealing with the problem in the internal body of the organisation. many planned work programs often fail because they are affected by internal issues.",vulnerable groups,"In conclusion, vulnerability is the most crucial part to be noticed in development which needs the role of others as a party to remove them from the primary problem that is being hit. Without immediate policy intervention leads to the empowerment of vulnerable groups, the development will be seen as a discriminatory effort. Vulnerable groups are those with disabilities because they are disabled, nursing, children, women, and poor people. The closest neighbourhood that makes it possible to help them is the PKK group located in the village. The PKK group plays an important role as the party, which is possible to do so, as did the PKK elephant group of elephants Peusangan village Pante Gajah. This group of PKK has had several programs that lead to the empowerment of vulnerable group communities based on participatory principles. That is to make the group vulnerable as a subject of the development that will be held, instead of placing them as development objects. The participatory approach to completing a group of vulnerable groups for children, for example, is the community collectively bringing the main educational functions to the core family. Revitalising the role of a family as an educational institution is an investor. So that, the distorted behaviour of children is not regarded as a fault of certain parties. Next up is a healthy environment for children. Children spend a lot of time interacting with the environment. The environment is where he plays, finds friends, stories and develops himself. Furthermore, it is an educational institution that serves to meet cognition, affection and psychomotor children. There needs to be a directed and measurable work program for resolving problems in a participatory group of vulnerable principles. By involving them as part of a development perpetrator, it does not make them an object. This study is still minimal and found some very fundamental flaws, which are not yet able to find the concept of development for the overall character of vulnerable society. This study saw more children as an object of study.","indonesia risna dewi and teuku alfiady faculty of social and political science universitas malikussaleh muara satu, aceh utara, aceh 24355, indonesia risna.dewi@unimal.ac.id, alfiadymsp@gmail.com jumadil saputra and zikri muhammad faculty of business, economics and social development universiti malaysia terengganu 21030 kuala nerus, terengganu, malaysia jumadil.saputra@umt.edu.my, zikri@umt.edu.my abdul talib bon department of production and operations universiti tun hussein onn malaysia 86400 parit raja, johor malaysia talibon@gmail.com",

33,Analysis Of The Adoption Of Evs And Charging  Infrastructure In Mexico,"the number of electric vehicles (evs) on the roads worldwide increased from few thousand units in 2010 to more than 10 million in 2020. developed countries show a rapid adoption of evs and an intensive deployment of public chargers. in developing countries, the pace of adoption is not as fast as in developed countries. in this paper, we analyze the sales of evs, the range characteristics of the bevs and the charging infrastructure in mexico. we develop time series decomposition and regression models to predict the quarterly and yearly sales of evs in mexico. the results show that the sales of evs in mexico have trend and seasonal effect. the first and fourth quarters show relatively high sales. however, the increasing trend is not enough to replace soon the sales of new internal combustion vehicles. in addition, considering that over 70% of battery evs sold in mexico are low-range vehicles, we show that interurban traveling is hindered for many bev models due to scarce charging infrastructure outside urban areas and compatibility issues of chargers.","electric vehicles, chargers, range","Electric mobility has been penetrating the markets worldwide at a high speed. Nevertheless, the pace of adoption of EVs in developing countries is slow. One of the main barriers is related with the scarce charging infrastructure and low range of BEVs, which produce range anxiety on the driver and hinders interurban traveling. In this paper, we analyzed the sales of EVs in Mexico and we fitted forecasting models to predict the incorporation of EVs on the roads of the country. In addition, we analyzed the feasibility to complete interurban trips using the state of Jalisco as a case study. The sales of EVs in Mexico follow a linear trend with seasonal patterns. The first and the fourth quarters of the year are the seasons with the largest sales. So far, most of the EVs sold are in states with high economic development, including Mexico City, Estado de Mexico, Queretaro, Jalisco and Nuevo Leon. According to the prediction model, in the next five years about 16,000 new EVs are expected to be sold. If this prediction occurs with a high level of accuracy, by 2025 there would be about 30,000 EVs on the roads of Mexico. This number is still very low compared with the 35 million of light passenger vehicles registered by the beginning of this year. Hence, incentives with greater impact must be implemented to accelerate the replacement of ICE vehicles. These incentives could be related with the deployment of charging infrastructure and the reduction of upfront cost of vehicles with high range. Most vehicles sold in Mexico are models with low range. In addition, charging infrastructure is mainly located in urban zones. Therefore, completing interurban traveling is challenging in Mexico. In the analysis presented for the state of Jalisco, we realize that current charging infrastructure is not enough to allow any BEV to complete trips within the state, and between the capital city Guadalajara and Mexico City. This problem is due not only to the lack of charging infrastructure, but also it is due to compatibility issues of fast chargers. Future research lines extend to analyzing the main highways in Mexico to determine the feasibility to complete the trips and formulating an optimization model for the location of new chargers considering ranges of existing BEVs and compatibility issues.

34,"Familiness From The Approach Of Participation, Essence And  Identity In Family Businesses Of Two Municipalities In The","there is no doubt about the importance of the family business within the economic fabric, that is why public policies and the academy of researchers around the world focus on ensuring their subsistence, since this type of company is one of the enterprises that disappears when passing to the second generation. because of this, it is necessary that researchers orient their efforts in those problems inherent to the operation of the organization, leaving aside intrinsic factors of the family-business circle, which are crucial for the survival of the company; thus, the literature review shows that said survival does not depend on economic issues but on other subjective factors. the construct “familiness” refers to the interaction that the family has in the company and, which leads the business to develop distinctive characteristics, which can contribute both to knowledge and shed light on the field of study of family businesses. therefore, the objective of this work is to analyze the relationship of the dimensions of the participation, essence and identity approaches of the business and the family business. the main results suggest that the dimensions of the participation, essence, as well as organizational identity approaches are related to the family business, that is, the influence of the family in the business is unavoidable, where from the level of participation of the family members the essence of the organization will depend on, allowing it to be distinguished from non-family members due to its unique, inseparable and synergistic characteristics.","familiness, family business, essence approach",,northern zone of the state of mexico: an empirical approach sayde suárez odilón universidad autónoma del estado de méxico centro universitario atlacomulco saydesuarezodilon@yahoo.com.mx zugaide escamilla salazar universidad autónoma del estado de méxico centro universitario atlacomulco zescamillas@uaemex.mx carlos robles acosta universidad autónoma del estado de méxico centro universitario ecatepec croblesa@uaemex.mx,
35,Building Models Based On Artificial Neural Networks To  Predict Customers’ Purchase Frequency,"customer loyalty depends on a combination of objective and subjective factors. for retailers, the benefit having a positive perception in the public is the credibility transmitted to their brands. this investigation is focused on the implementation of artificial neural networks (ann) to predict customers’ loyalty to supermarket chains measured in terms of their purchase frequency. the research is carried out following a classic 4-stage methodology (analysis, design, development, and validation). during the analysis, the results of a customer loyalty survey are preprocessed. during the design, the full questionnaire is divided into several domains (e.g. products’ quality, buying experience, etc.). each domain is then used to build and compare predictive models. the original dataset containing 1.050 surveys is split up in two sets: 80% of data for training and test, and the remaining 20% for validation. to predict customer loyalty twelve different ann-based models are built. the results reveal that the proposed ann-based models can predict correctly 60% and 72% of customers’ purchase frequency. in conclusion, predictive ann-based models help determine how often an average customer made purchases on a given supermarket chain with a reasonable degree of certainty by means of analyzing some of their habits and preferences.","purchase frequency, customer loyalty, private label","The survey about supermarket chains and private labels used this research provides enough data to build models to predict customers’ loyalty in terms of their frequency of purchase. In other words, how often they visit the chain’s stores. Whether the purchase frequency is the best indicator to measure the loyalty is not part this work’s scope, which, instead, is limited to the building of predictive models based on ANNs. During the building of a machine learning model it is recommendable to implement a cross-validation scheme to minimize the influence of the dataset split up instead of holding out a portion of the data. Averaging the results of k iteration will be always better than having only one result. Furthermore, replicating the experiment many times allow estimate the variability of the results, which can be expressed in terms of the standard deviation of the percentage of correctly predicted classes. On the other hand, having a validation helps determine whether the models can generalize properly or not. Since, considering a complete rotation of k folds, during the cross-validation each instance (rows) is used for training k-1 times, data are known to the predictive. For this reason, it is crucial to have a separated validation set to evaluate the models’ performance with unknown data. The results of the experiment replications show that only models M6 and M11 predict correctly less than 70% of customers’ purchase frequency with the training and test dataset. With the validation dataset, instead, only models M0, M1, M2, M4, M5 and M10 predicted correctly over around 70% of the instances. In the latter case, although prediction ratios are similar, between 69% and 72%, there are significant differences in the number of attributes used to build each model, being M0 the largest one with 26 attributes and M1 the smallest with only 5. From the prediction rate, it seems that each domain provides enough information to build models that have a similar performance. This a particularly important result because it proves that a short and focused survey is equally useful than an extensive one when predicting purchase frequency. Finally, prediction ratios and confusion matrices suggest that the ANN-based classification models M0, M1, M2, M4, M5 and M10 help predict customers’ purchase frequency.","galo paiva departamento de ingeniería industrial y sistemas universidad de la frontera temuco, chile galo.paiva@uforntera.cl carlos hernández departamento de procesos industriales universidad católica de temuco temuco, chile carlos.hernandez.zavala@uct.cl",

This new information can be used to adapt lectures and contents to help undergraduate students develop the necessary skills to start their business or to facilitate their access and adaptation to private companies. When working with machine learning schemes, it is recommendable to apply a cross-validation to minimize the influence of the dataset split up instead of simply holding out a portion of data. Averaging k classification results will be always better than having only one result. Furthermore, running replications help reduce the bias caused by the fold partitioning. Having a validation dataset is an important part of the investigation, it helps determine whether the models can generalize properly or not. The classification results show that only the proposed models M0, M4, and M9 can predict correctly over 70% of the students’ preferences with the training and test dataset. With the validation dataset the situation is similar, being M0, M4, and M9 the only models predicting correctly over 70% of the surveys. Even though, prediction ratios are similar (72%, 77%, and 78%) there are significant differences in the number of attributes used to build each model, being M0 the largest one with 56 attributes (questions). Both, M4 and M9 employ 26 and 27 attributes respectively. In all cases, the domain related to entrepreneurial interest (D4) is present. This one, with 24 questions, is the largest domain used in this investigation. Finally, prediction ratios and confusion matrices suggest that the proposed classification models M0, M4, and M9 based on artificial neural networks can help predict mid-term professional career preferences among engineering students.

44,Configuration Of Electric Vehicles For Specific Applications  From A Sustainable Perspective,"this study aims to design a powertrain configuration tailored for specific applications, allowing a reduction of net emissions, investment cost, and operational cost when comparing to its fossil fueled alternative. the methodology is divided into 3 phases: i) select the specific niche to be electrified whose local conditions ease their social adaptation and monitor their current operation for a long time to determine their driving patterns and operational conditions, ii) construct a real-world driving cycle based on the typical driving profile of the niche using the energy based micro- trips method, and iii) define the vehicle performance metrics to optimize and then based on a multi-objective optimization and an iterative energy-based approach, determine the best electric vehicle’s powertrain configuration (number of batteries, motor size, and gearbox transmission ratio) that optimizes the chosen performance metrics. in this work, a university shuttle service is considered as the case study. based on a measurement campaign on the normal operation of these buses, a geometrical gearbox and an energy management system have been designed through a multi-objective optimization using an iterative energy-based approach. it was considered deep-cycle lead acid and lithium polimer (lipo) batteries within the design of choice. the best results were observed with lipo batteries, which shows improvements of the vehicle’s acceleration capacity by 26.5% while at the same time reducing energy consumption by 37%, co2 emissions by 31%, and the total cost of ownership by 10% when compared to its counterpart diesel buses. furthermore, it was studied the evolution of the tco as a function of autonomy under this configuration, and it was obtained that the tco can be even better to its diesel counterpart under low autonomies (< 160km). in the case of study considered in this work (aka circuitotec), each route has approximate distances of 25 km and therefore a range of 50+ km is reasonable. therefore, for this application, the operation of passenger transport with electric buses is not only feasible, but it is also a better choice.","powertrain, energy management, driving cycles",,"josé ignacio huertas, antonio e. mogro and juan p. jimenez school of engineering and science tecnologico de monterrey monterrey, mexico jhuertas@tec.mx, a01366355@itesm.mx, jpjimenez@exatec.tec.mx",

This requires talented employees and designers which have the competence and capability to generate ideas and smart solutions for given tasks. From the perspective of an engineering design education the challenge is to prepare students in a way that they will achieve these capabilities. Students and design beginners usually have poor problem solving experience. Therefore, the instructors face the challenge to convey appropriate means and techniques to foster creativity and the generation of ideas and solutions. It has long been recognized, that a structured systematic design process and the use of appropriately embedded techniques is inspiring with respect to the number and variety of generated ideas. In this context, the development of classification schemes, which has been demonstrated and described in detail, is a good means to extend the number of solutions in different directions. Classification schemes facilitate the identification of important product characteristics and initiate the combination of essential solution characteristics. It makes the design process and the methodology more understandable. Students experience the production of ideas and design variants, which encourages and strengthens their confidence, and a systematic variation is definitely a source of creativity and innovation. They benefit also from written documentation, visualization of solutions in formal schemes, and of comprehensive worked out exercises. Note: Experienced design engineers have a lot of solution options of given tasks in their minds and are able to retrieve appropriate solution patterns when specific design problems come up, but these patterns are not available for beginners, they have to work for them.

49,Analysis Of Autism Spectrum Disorder And Metrics Of Eye  Movement,"this paper studies the relationship between eye movement and autism spectrum disorder (asd), a comparison that can be easily made in most homes with current advances in ai and basic webcam technology. diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder in children is an important and difficult task which is crucial for children who need treatment or aid. therefore, it is optimal that people take advantage of modern technology to create accessible methods of diagnosis that are reliable. the data studied is a dataset of images and the eye traces of children with asd and children without asd who viewed the images. weighted distance variance, a measure of how variable eye movement is, is calculated using trace data that has a gaussian filter applied. additionally, the mean brightness and variance of brightness in the images are also calculated. the weighted distance variance is compared for the children with asd and the children without asd. the two groups are also compared by their reactions to the brightness of the images. the data analysis reveals that variableness of eye movement can be used to differentiate children with asd and children without asd. however, the two groups’ reactions to image brightness are found to be indifferentiable. 1. introduction the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (asd) in children is an important task, as it allows children with asd to get adequate and appropriate treatment during the developmental stages of their life. current diagnosis techniques include monitoring the subject’s behavior throughout childhood and beyond, but there are no medical tests for asd (cdc 2021). treatments for asd include cognitive behavior therapy and nutritional therapy, but are not standardized and can vary from person to person (nichd 2021). with early diagnosis and treatment, autistic children can more effectively make progress against asd and even completely move themselves off the spectrum later in life (nichd 2021). however, many children go undiagnosed until they are older, and often do not get as many resources for their disability (wiggins et al. 2019). especially in children of minority groups, the accuracy and thoroughness of diagnosis is often less than the quality of diagnosis that white children receive (wiggins et al. 2019). additionally, the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder is a complex ordeal that could span months and years, which can leave the few unlucky to remain undiagnosed until they are much older. the purpose of the project is to study the variableness of eye movement and the brightness of the observed images, and whether they are behavioral indicators of asd. with current technology and software, eye movement is relatively simple for people with access to technology to measure. therefore, by thorough analysis of eye movement, the diagnosis of asd in children could become more accessible to people, as it could be done directly in homes instead of at clinics and in tedious evaluations. current research on the topic focuses on how trace paths of eye movement can be used to detect asd. with deep learning models being used to diagnose asd (xie et al. 2019) and models using eye trace maps to analyze how often the subject makes eye contact (solovyova et al. 2020). moreover, convolutional neural networks, models that specialize in analyzing image data, have been used as well to give accurate and fast diagnoses of asd (fernández et al. 2020). this paper instead analyzes the isolated variable of the variableness of eye movement in relation to asd and focuses on how the variable can be used to differentiate between children with asd and children without asd. separate from previous research, this paper does not give a model for diagnosing asd, but instead hopes to demonstrate why and how the variableness of eye movement can be used by predictive models to diagnose asd. proceedings of the international conference on industrial engineering and operations management monterrey, mexico, november 3-5, 2021 © ieom society international 390",,"From the results of the analysis, the conclusion can be made that there is indeed an association between erratic eye movement and ASD. When comparing the distributions of the weighted distance variance of the children that had ASD and the children without ASD, a highly significant result of 𝑡𝑡= 7.87 (𝑃𝑃= 1.64 ∙10−14) was returned. This indicates that weighted distance variance could be used as a helpful measure of erratic eye movement to draw the distinction between children with ASD and children without. For brightness and eye movement, the difference between the two groups was not realized by the data. In the tests on the correlation between mean brightness of image and weighted distance variance, the tests for both the ASD and non-ASD group returned statistically insignificant results of 𝑟𝑟𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴= −0.0165 (𝑃𝑃𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴= 0.776) and 𝑟𝑟𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇= 0.0557 (𝑃𝑃𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇= 0.337), meaning that there was no helpful distinction that could be drawn between the two groups using the mean brightness metric. Similarly, for the same tests performed on the mean brightness of image and weighted distance variance variables, significant but very weak correlation coefficients of 𝑟𝑟𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴= 0.120 (𝑃𝑃𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴= 0.0376) and 𝑟𝑟𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇= 0.128 (𝑃𝑃𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇= 0.0261) were returned. It was found for both correlation tests that the mean brightness or variance of brightness of the images could not be useful for separating the ASD and non-ASD group for predictions, as the tests returned similar results for both groups. So, comparing the eye movement with relation to the brightness would not be helpful for making predictions or drawing distinctions between children with ASD and children without ASD. 5. Future Research Future investigations of this project could gather more data with more children, which would make the sample more reflective of the population. Possible sources of error in the current analysis could come from biases in the sample itself, as a group of 14 children does not seem to completely encompass the population of children. Some questions to ask for future researchers would be whether there is a better way to analyze the eye movement of the children, other than using simple weighted variance. Future investigations could be done to answer questions about whether eye movement is a good indicator for diagnosing autism in children, compared to current methods. Determining whether the eye movement can be tracked and analyzed in real time would be an interesting follow-up to the current project. Moreover, similar analysis could be applied to different sources of data, such as features of the images instead of simply the behavior of eye movement (He et al. 2021).","ethan s. yun stanford online high school redwood city, ca 94063, usa ethansyun@icloud.com",
50,Relationship Between Playing Video Games And Happiness,"the purpose of this study is to determine whether playing video games is associated with happiness - both in short and longer terms. previous studies have identified mixed results of video games on mental health. for this study, data was obtained through an online survey sent to teenage students in online and brick-and-mortar schools. three variables were collected: hours spent playing video games per week, hours of sleep per week (as a confounding variable), and “happiness” ranked on a scale of 1-10. there was an overall, undefined happiness and a “happiness” broken into satisfaction in three categories: academics, relationships, and extracurriculars. because it was inferred that the average of the satisfaction in the three different categories did not fit with the overall happiness, the averages were used going forward. there were no significant results showing that sleep or “happiness” were different for people who did and did not play video games. the final test of association only indicated that the “happiness” of an individual in a month was associated with hours of sleep. though the results do not suggest that happiness is associated with playing video games, there was enough evidence that happiness was associated with sleep in a month.","happiness, video games, sleep","The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between hours spent playing video games and happiness. The hours of sleep was collected as a confounding variable. The Chi-Square Goodness of Fit Test determined that the average of the three categories of happiness (satisfaction in academics, relationships, and extracurriculars) did not fit the overall happiness. Because the average of the three categories was more specific and well-defined, it was a better measure of “happiness” in this study. This average was used for the other tests. In the study, the only significant result detected was that “happiness” in a month is associated with sleep; no results that suggested an association between “happiness” and video games were detected. From the normal distribution in the Mann-Whitney test, no significant results were obtained. Three inferences were drawn based on the sample: 1) the average hours of sleep for people who do and do not play video games were from similar populations, 2) the “happiness” in a week of people who do and do not play video games were from similar populations, and 3) the “happiness” in a month of people who do and do not play video games were also from similar populations. The first result was not unexpected, for there could be people who spent little time playing video games and it would not influence their hours of sleep. Whether one plays video games or not, their average hours of sleep and “happiness” in different time intervals were the same, indicating that video games do not appear to affect “happiness.” These two results were unexpected and did not support the initial hypothesis that video games and “happiness” would be from populations with different averages. From the Chi-square Test of Association, 5 inferences were drawn and only one result was significant - the test for “happiness” in a month and sleep. Firstly, there is not enough evidence to show that the hours of sleep and hours of video games are associated, which does not support the initial hypothesis that sleep is be a confounding variable that may be influenced by hours spent playing video games.

56,Cooperative And Msme Empowerment Strategies In  Economic Recovery During The Covid-19 Pandemic In Bogor,"the development of organizations in indonesia is increasingly rapid and competitive. one of the growing organizations in indonesia is a cooperative. cooperative is a form of business that is characterized by togetherness or based on kinship. in indonesia, cooperatives are engaged in various fields to achieve community welfare. at first, cooperatives were a collection of people who had a lower level of the economy, where through cooperatives they both wanted or had a goal to improve their welfare. nationally, the number of registered cooperatives is more than adequate to support the people's economic movement. this means that if the existing number has a paradigm, ideology, and a real cooperative spirit, it will become a very large force and provide guarantees for economic sustainability that is based on the spirit of self-help and cooperation. this condition actually became the ideals of the founding fathers of the nation when they had to choose the economic model to be built when the world was divided into 2 (two) models, namely capitalism and socialism. cooperatives have similarities with the original social system of the indonesian nation, namely collectivism. the indonesian gotong royong community likes to help each other.","cooperatives, people's economy, business entities, family","Cooperatives and MSMEs, especially micro, must build the synergy of the two institutions to be necessary. Because the potential for micro-enterprises, especially those associated with cooperatives, is quite large. First, the dominance of economic activity in Indonesia in terms of a large number of MSMEs. Second, micro MSMEs have the fighting power to survive in a difficult economic era. This is verified by history. Third, MSMEs when they join cooperatives have strong bargaining power with third parties. Because cooperatives with legal entities will easily access capital, provide guidance to their members and have the opportunity to prosper together. Fourth, there are requirements for synergy, namely improvements to cooperatives so that regulations are strong enough, professional management, access to capital opportunities, and assistance from both central and regional governments. Cooperatives must keep up with the times and utilize digital considering that in the covid era, physical interaction is very limited so that innovative business actors by utilizing digital technology have far more potential to access better markets. With assistance from the government local, technically it accommodates the role of the parties in digital marketing and educates business actors to have the capacity to take advantage of access to digital marketing. It is necessary to formulate policies that are implementable in the form of programming and activities by the Department of Cooperatives and MSMEs in Bogor Regency to strengthen and empower cooperatives, in the form of Changes in business models and management and services.","district dinalara d butarbutar and mustika mega wijaya department of law, faculty of law pakuan university bogor, indonesia dinalara.dw@gmail.com , mustikamega@unpak.ac.id",

60,The Impact Of Narcotics Use And Selling In Criminological  Studies: Learn From Indonesia,"one of the factors that hinders development in both indonesia and many other countries is the problem of narcotics. narcotics now touches all levels of society and is very detrimental to the state. in order to find a solution to this problem, narcotics is often the object of study from law and criminology. this paper purposes to analyze the impact of the use and trafficking of narcotics in indonesia and law enforcement on narcotics crimes in indonesia. the method used is socio-juridical using a statutory approach, case approach, and criminology. the data used are primary data and secondary data obtained through interviews, literature study and document study. all data collected were then analyzed qualitatively. the results showed that the direct impact of drugs on the human psyche/mental is causing mental depression, serious mental disorders/psychotic, causing suicide, and causing crime, violence and destruction. the factors causing narcotics crimes in the jurisdiction of the kutai barat police department, which the authors managed to get from the field study, could be caused by many factors, both internal (family, economy, personality) and external (intercommunication and social/community) factors. law enforcement is an effort to bring the ideas of justice, legal certainty and social benefits into reality. the efforts made by the kutai barat police department in overcoming narcotics crimes that occurred in the kutai baratregency and mahakam ulu regency were carried out in two ways, namely preventive (prevention before the crime occurred) and repressive (after the crime).","indonesia, they are adri",,"dr. esti royani faculty of law,17 agustus 1945 university, samarinda, indonesia esti.untagsmd.hukum@gmail.com",
61,"Net Promoter Score Scale Transformed Into A Logit Model,  A Full-Service Restaurant Approach.","the objective of this research was to analyze the relationship between the net promoter score (nps), broadly used in industry, with dichotomous word-of-mouth (wom) metric to gain more insight into customer satisfaction. the nps is an indicator, which its author claims to be the ultimate question that industry practitioners should be increasing. the nps system works with a single question: how likely are you to recommend our company to friends and family? this methodology classifies the status of interviewed clients into three groups using an eleven-point likert scale: the ones answering from 0 to 6 are treated like detractors, the ones answering 7 and 8 are treated like passives and the ones answering 9 and 10 are treated like promoters. the methodology of this research was quantitative and exploratory. the data collection was through a probabilistic approach with a self-administered survey presented by waiters on a tablet in a full-service restaurant. the chosen statistical method was a logit regression towards suggesting a scale transformation; the reason to do so is to face one of the most criticized characteristics of the nps system, which is the lack of justification while clustering. the results show evidence that the relationship between metrics is statistically significant. the originality of the article resides in the contribution of a complementary metric on the nps system. instead of making three big groups, the logit approach comes up with a probability of word-of-mouth intention for each of the responses to achieve more insight for each type of client in the original classification.","nps, logit, restaurants","The main research question in this paper aims to know how the NPS clusters clients could be better, so in this fashion, the data shows that the probability of detractors to recommend varies a lot. The value of 0 in the NPS means a 0.22% probability that the client would be willing to recommend, while the value of 6 on the NPS represents above 81.45% of the probability. If NPS is claimed to be a predictor metric of some other outcomes, such as loyalty and growth (Reichheld, 2003), a serious concert is derived from this investigation regarding the arguments and reasons about NPS treating the same way responders from 0 to 6, which in all probability implies going from 0 to up to 80%, making predictability, in this case, of willingness to recommend very inaccurate.

62,Ambidexterity: Strategies To Deal With The Impact Of The  Covid-19 Pandemic On Smes In Indonesia’S Creative,"at present, smes are facing problems caused by the covid-19 pandemic. in indonesia, covid-19 has put pressure on the economy of the entire country, resulting in an impact of 3% to 16% of pdp. the covid-19 pandemic also resulted in indonesia's economic growth dropping to 2.3%, and a threat to the stability of the financial sector. the weakening in terms of the economy due to the covid-19 pandemic has an impact on households, companies, and smes. the problems faced by many smes in all industrial sectors, including the creative industry sector, are cash flow problems, supply chains, and changes in public demand. this article will discuss that the current state of the covid-19 pandemic demands changes to smes in the creative industry in indonesia. smes need to explore new things but at the same time maintain existing businesses or carry out ambidexterity. to do ambidexterity, smes need to obtain external resources to increase internal resources, so it is necessary to build social networks and good cooperation with external parties. social networks can provide a variety of external resources, both tangible and intangible, so that they can overcome resource shortages and increase the ability to perform ambidexterity. the output of this research is a comprehensive model that describes a framework to be tested empirically.","ambidexterity, social networks, covid-19",,"industry maria pampa kumalaningrum management doctoral program-faculty of economic and business universitas gadjah mada (ugm), yogyakarta, indonesia department of management-faculty of economic and business stie yayasan keluarga pahlawan negara (stie ykpn), yogyakarta, indonesia pampa@stieykpn.ac.id, pampamaria@gmail.com wakhid slamet ciptono, nurul indarti, boyke rudy purnomo department of management-faculty of economic and business universitas gadjah mada (ugm), yogyakarta, indonesia",
63,Simulation Improves Service And Operations At A  Franchise Resale Store,"in the early years of the lengthening history of usage of discrete-event system simulation, its primary domain of application was manufacturing and assembly operations; indeed, the automotive industry was one of its early adopters. in the last few years, the range of application of this valuable industrial-engineering analytics tool has greatly expanded to include delivery of health care services (e.g., hospitals, clinics, pharmacies), improvement of supply chains via application to warehousing and transport operations, government services such as airports and mass transit networks, and the consumer sector (hotels, retail stores, and delivery of services such as grooming and hair care). the project described in this paper is an application of discrete-event process simulation to a resale retail store (one of a franchise) which buys and resells gently used children’s clothing, toys, books, equipment, and furniture. the project successfully addressed challenges faced by the store management; these challenges comprise long queues (especially for resale), misallocation of resources, and consequent dissatisfaction of store employees, customers seeking to buy from the store or sell items no longer needed to the store.","retail sales, service industry",,"caitlin pethers, marie ruesga, parker moesta, and edward j williams business analytics, college of business, university of michigan – dearborn dearborn, mi, 48126, usa cpethers@umich.edu, mruesga@umich.edu, parkermo@umich.edu, williame@umich.edu","References

64,Application Of Factorial Analysis And Multiple Regression  For The Prediction Of The Stabilization Time In Furnaces In,"the purpose of this study is to determine the relationship between the values and attributes of the loads in the forged rings in materials such as nickel, titanium and waspaloy in furnaces for their heat treatment, the effect on the preparation time, duration and stabilization of the temperature of the furnaces, to be within parameters and be able to carry out the loads and start their holding time according to the recipe assigned for their heat treatment. applying the factorial analysis method, it is possible to identify a reduced number of significant factors that can represent the relationship of the independent variables set, as well as a multiple regression analysis that allows the establishment of a system for estimating or predicting the time it takes for the furnace to operate the preheating and to receive the programmed charge. 6,135 data of the loads between of the year 2018 and 2019 were collected, the results had a total variance of 64.61%, a kmo index of 0.620 and a bartlett sphericity test with a significance of 0.00. the study significantly identifies three important factors on the time of preparation of furnaces obtained from the factorial analysis, which are: the conditions between loads that represent 33.203% of the total variance, the temperature precision for the load 18.149% and the exposure of matter in ovens 13,263%. from the factors identified in the multiple regression analysis, it was obtained that the relevant variables are: the temperature difference with respect to the previous load, the weight of the load, the load of the holding time and the treatment temperature for its maintenance has a significant impact on setup time. the result of this research benefits programmers to formulate load sequencing more efficiently in the heat treatment area.","heat treatment, estimation, factor analysis, rodríguez","This study has identified three important factors such as the conditions between charges, the temperature accuracy for the charge, and the mass exposure in ovens. In addition, this study also established that there is a substantial association with the temperature difference between loads, the tons of the load, the holding time or soak, and the treatment temperature. This study has some limitations. This document considers only eight independent variables: the type of the loads heat treatment, the number of pieces or batch size, the load weight, the alloy hardness, the treatment temperature for its support, the furnace tolerance for its stabilization, the load holding time and the temperature difference based on the previous load, excluding the number of pieces or lot size as it is not significant in the analysis. This study consists of a dependent variable, the preparation time or ovens preheating. In the future, similar studies could be carried out by adding more number of dependent variables that allow the exposed phenomenon to be explained more fully. This study was done only in the heat treatment area of the Aerospace plant. A similar study can be expanding for the rest of the forging plants. The results of this research are relevant to determine the priority order of the variables that allow generating the programming sequencing that increases the efficiency of the heat treatment area, and consequently, reduce the stay time of parts and the cost of travel. Using the multiple regression, a model is generated which allows predicting the expected time to prepare the furnaces for batch loads of rolled rings.","the heat treatment area in a metalworking company msc. refugio chávez hernández doctorate in supply chain management and logistics, popular autonomous university of puebla state, méxico. refugio.chavez@upaep.com.mx, refugio.chavez@udem.edu phd. josé luis martínez flores faculty of industrial, logistics and manufacturing popular autonomous university of puebla state, méxico. joseluis.martinez01@upaep.mx eng. carlos mario leal garza industrial and system engineer university of monterrey, méxico. carlos.lealg@udem.edu",
65,Enhancement Of Corrosion Resistance Of Hot-Dip   Galvanized Carbon Steel By Low Amount Of Ni Addition,"hot dip galvanizing is one of the oldest and more used methods to protect steels substrates from corrosion due to the good corrosion resistance of the zn coatings. this work studies the effect of the addition of small amounts of ni to hot-dip galvanizing bath on the corrosion behaviour of hot-dipped zn rich coating using open circuit potential (ocp), electrochemical noise (enm) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (eis). the results show that the zn-ni coating alloys exhibit nobler potentials and low current density indicating the increase of the corrosion resistance of the sample due to the protective effect provided by the oxides formed on zn-ni coating alloys. however, the corrosion products allow the mass transfer of aggressive species showing a semi-infinite behaviour. the protective effect shows a relationship with the ni amount employed. the hot-dip method for deposition of znni coatings using 0.5% ni exhibit the best performance.",zn-ni coatings,"The corrosion characterization of hot-dip galvanized steel samples covered with Zn, Zn-0.1%Ni and Zn0.5%Ni was performed and several conclusions can be derived. The results obtained indicate that the coating displays a stratified developed by the intermetallic phases η, ζ, δ and γ related with the Zn diffusion process. Also, the existent phases changes with the Ni amount added leading to the formation of a two and three-layered structure as Ni amount increase. The composition of the coating remains almost constant, evidencing the presence of crystalline phases attributed to simonkolleite, zinc hydroxide, zinc and Ni. The corrosion behaviour of the samples shows that the samples exhibit at least two electrochemical processes related to the charge transfer and the protective behaviour of the coating and the oxide layer. Additionally, the mass transport is evidenced attributed to the displacement of aggressive species through the corrosion products layer developed. The impedance modulus and the polarization resistance slightly increase with the amount of Ni added. The protective effect of the layer decreases in a short time but trends to stabilize as immersion time proceeds.","rafael gonzalez-parra, arturo barba-pingarrón, raúl valdez- navarro, alba covelovillar, miguel a. hernández-gallegos centro de ingeniería de superficies y acabados (cenisa). departamento de ingeniería de diseño y manufactura. división de ingeniería mecánica e industrial. facultad de ingeniería. unam. 2o nivel. edificio ""t"" (bernardo quintana). circuito exterior. ciudad universitaria. coyoacan, 04510, ciudad de méxico. rafael.parra@yandex.com, arturo.barba@ingenieria.unam.edu, raulgvaldez@hotmail.com, acovelov@gmail.com, mahg@yahoo.com javier cervantes-cabello centro de ingeniería avanzada. departamento de ingeniería de diseño y manufactura. división de ingeniería mecánica e industrial. edificio x. 2o piso. circuito exterior, ciudad universitaria. coyoacan, 04510, ciudad de méxico. cercab2@yahoo.com.mx",

68,Incorporated Fuzzy Robust Principal Component Analysis  With Context-Dependent Data Envelopment Analysis For An,"one of the critical challenges of traditional data envelopment analysis (dea) is a lack of discriminant ability, particularly if there is a relatively large amount of variables with respect to observations. to overcome this problem and uncover some essential messages behind successful business operations, this research introduces an advanced decision making scheme that combines fuzzy robust principal component analysis (frpca) and context-dependent data envelopment analysis (cd-dea) to handle the performance measurement task. frpca condenses a large amount of information into some essential and manageable elements, while cd-dea derives the learning path of each observation to reach an assessable benchmark. the introduced scheme not only yields a precise performance evaluation outcome, but also equips it with forecasting capability via artificial intelligence (ai) adoption. the introduced scheme, examined by real cases, is a promising alternative for performance forecasting and evaluation.","decision making, mexico",,"advanced decision making process fu-hsiang chen department of accounting, chinese culture university, taipei, taiwan, r.o.c. chenfuhsiang1@gmail.com te-min chang department of information management, national sun yat-sen university, kaohsiung, taiwan, r.o.c. temin@cm.nsysu.edu.tw hsueh-li huang english program of global business, chinese culture university, taipei, taiwan, r.o.c. shirleyhuang60@gmail.com sin-jin lin* department of accounting, chinese culture university, taipei, taiwan, r.o.c. annman1204@gmail.com (corresponding author: s.-j. lin) ming-fu hsu department of business management, national united university, miaoli, taiwan, r.o.c. hsumf0222@gmail.com yu-lin huang english program of global business, chinese culture university, taipei, taiwan, r.o.c. huangyulin18@gmail.com",

To achieve the initial research goal, the authors used the following steps: define the HEI classroom as a business unit, study for the different quality meanings in education, use four publications from authors that had firsthand TPS knowledge, map HEIs classroom process, and group the TPS factors or lessons in the four main TPS principles. An initial list of behaviors was documented using the author’s academic experience. Although this research has some limitations, such as among of literature included in the research, HEI classroom mapping, and behaviors definitions, the authors believe that this could be used as initial work to conduct future work with more research methodology research. For example: a SLR of TPS principles, identification of faculty and student behaviors observing a full day of work, and complement TPS application in HEI classroom with other educational concepts, as excellence in higher education.","fernando gonzalez-aleu department of computer systems and industrial engineering universidad de monterrey san pedro garza garcía, nl, 66238, méxico fernando.gonzalezaleu@udem.edu jesus vazquez-hernandez innovation and strategy advanced value chain institute san pedro garza garcía, nl., 66250, mexico jvazquezh79@gmail.com mario alberto del valle velez vicepresidente asociación de exbecarios de mexico en japón miguel hidalgo, ciudad de méxico, mexico mdelvalle@jica.mx",

It is important to mention that the organizational culture traits of adaptability and consistence were manifested on the organizational culture subsequent to the capacitation during the process to the organizational conduct for example, help, loyalty, compliance, initiative, civic virtue, and self-development. The organizational citizenship behavior self- development was only reflected two years after the capacitation, when the organizational cultural mission trait was identified for the personal, in this way the self-development allows the coworker to feel identified with the organizational mission, moreover the organizational citizenship behavior sportsmanship does not demonstrate relationship in no way organizational culture traits.","suppliers of international steel companies phd maría mayela terán cázares investigation- professor facultad de contaduría pública y administración universidad autónoma de nuevo león av. universidad s/n cd. universidad c.p. 66455. san nicolás de los garza, nuevo león, méxico mayela.teran@gmail.com mayela.teranc@uanl.mx phd mónica blanco jiménez investigation- professor facultad de contaduría pública y administración universidad autónoma de nuevo león av. universidad s/n cd. universidad c.p. 66455. san nicolás de los garza, nuevo león, méxico monica.blancojm@uanl.edu.mx me blanca nelly rodríguez garza professor facultad de contaduría pública y administración universidad autónoma de nuevo león av. universidad s/n cd. universidad c.p. 66455. san nicolás de los garza, nuevo león, méxico blanca.rodriguezgrz@uanl.edu.mx bngarza6@gmail.com lic. ivon abigail gonzález garza student facultad de contaduría pública y administración universidad autónoma de nuevo león av. universidad s/n cd. universidad c.p. 66455. san nicolás de los garza, nuevo león, méxico ivon.gonzalezga@uanl.edu.mx ivonne.gzz.gza@gmail.com",
72,An Analysis Of Visual Subitization Across Different Modes  Of Peripheral Vision,"subitizing, the ability of people to unconsciously and accurately count sufficiently small quantities of objects, is heavily tied to both visual perception and a somewhat fundamental understanding of mathematics. peripheral vision, despite its wide range, has relatively poor visual acuity relative to central vision, which is primarily used when one focuses on an object. by using a custom testing interface (which flashed an image for a specific duration of time) and logging the result, it was possible to see the effect that peripheral vision, and by extension its reduced perception, had on the ability of one to subitize. the results indicated that there was a statistically significant difference for the accuracies between central vision and peripheral vision, but such a difference was not found between near peripheral vision and far peripheral vision.","subitization, counting, perception, peripheral vision","Based on the data collected and statistically analyzed in this study, I have been able to illustrate that the mean precision is different among tests from different angles of vision (F = 47.5, p < .001.). However, I have been unable to detect such a difference exists between near and far peripheral vision (same as for previous sentence—need ot report the actual values!). Despite the relatively large amount of data points tested, the p-values for statistical significance should be considered as an upper bound due to the small amount of people tested. The convenience sample could have also caused further confounding of the variables.","juni kim stanford online high school redwood city, ca 94063, usa junickim@ohs.stanford.edu",
73,A Systematic Review On Factors Affecting Remote Working  Employees During The Covid-19 Pandemic,"the pandemic has changed the lives of everyone. to adapt to this unexpected situation employees in most sectors have shifted to remote working and it has become the “new normal” almost overnight. therefore “telecommuting” has suddenly become a quite popular concept. this current paper systematically reviews the available literature under remote working practices and its impact on employees. it was identified that previous research has focused on different categories of factors. therefore, the identified factors were categorized accordingly. also, the impact on employees were closely studied. the current study was conducted through a systematic review of literature using the prisma framework. 36 studies which were carried out before and during the pandemic from different countries and sectors related to remote working has been reviewed. based on the findings of the current review proper guidelines have been provided for the decision makers of organizations and directions for future research has been provided.","remote working, covid-19, prisma framework","The current paper has systematically reviewed the literature related to remote working effect on employees conducted both before and during the pandemic. The studies show that each author has defined the same variable in different ways. This has been done to match the industry and the context of the study. Studies done before the pandemic shows that there is positive relationship between remote working and other factors. But studies also reveal that prolonged remote working can lead to a negative outcome. It was also evident that most of the studies have focused on the psychological factors of employees. The current review reveals that when teleworkers are supported by their organizations, they are more productive. Therefore, organizations should focus more on making the work from home experience more comfortable for their employees. The future research conducted in remote working specially during the pandemic should focus more on specific industries and different types of economies.","narmada siyambalapitiya and ruwan wickramarachchi department of industrial management university of kelaniya sri lanka siyambal_im16084@stu.kln.ac.lk, ruwan@kln.ac.lk",
74,The Alternatives On Last Mile Delivery Logistics: Insights On  Customers' Preferences,"the last mile logistic is the delivery to the end consumer and it is the most important step when considering the entire logistical distribution process involved in e-commerce. analyzing the process backwardly, there are many concerns about how to ensure that the product reaches the customer in a satisfactory manner, as the operations have high distribution costs, are polluting, and/or low efficient. there are several vehicles placed on route to serve different regions within the same city. there are often areas with heavy traffic that demand efficient planning of routes and delivery times. in this context, technology becomes a strong ally of the last mile. technological revolutions over the past 60 years have enabled greater connectivity and integration in product distribution, and the adoption of smart tools connected via iot, mobile and ai is crucial for companies that want to thrive in this environment. based on a survey and literature review, the objective of this work is to identify which are the last mile delivery alternatives available on the market to relate them to the customer's perception regarding delivery preference, and the environmental impact inherent in the choice. as a result, this study showed that the age of the respondents is a factor that can influence their perceived safer mode of last mile delivery.","last mile, e-commerce, technology, sustainability","This paper aimed to bring for discussion the current alternatives used in last mile logistics in Brazil, acknowledge by a population sample with a range of age from 18 to 60 year or more. After one week, it was possible to gather data to analyze the customer’s preference regarding different ways of receiving purchased stuffs, not limiting to food or bigger home appliances. Then we correlated the respondents age with their perceived safer mode of distribution by running a correspondence analysis test in R software. As a result of the analysis, we could conclude that older respondents consider bicycles safer rather than drones, vans, reception boxes and motorcycles, as the younger do. However, bicycles are not the top #1 preference between customers. Giving this, we can infer that even being the safer delivery mode, the customers consulted would rather prefer to receive their deliveries in a faster or less secure way. Limitations of this study are the number of respondents, which could be higher to generalize results, and that the answers of the respondents correspond to their opinion in a specific period of time. We must consider that the respondents’ opinions can change once they get more information about other distribution modes. Future works may expand the survey questions, in order to investigate further the reasons that make respondents feel safer with a distribution mode when compared to another.

76,Development And Application Of An E-Kanban System In The  Automotive Industry,"industry 4.0 did not just bring new requirements for today’s industries, it also brought new technologies to increase its efficiency and effectiveness. in this work, an e-kanban system for internal logistics and production is developed and implemented in the automotive industry. the system functions according to the kanban methodology, where the consumption usage of a part triggers its replenishment. the development of the presented e-kanban system took into consideration the limitations and improvement opportunities of previous works where authors developed their own e- kanban systems. before the e-kanban system’s application, a simulation using the eks© software was performed to obtain the number of labels and stock levels needed for the calibration of the e-kanban system. the system was then applied, and the results show a 19% stock reduction and a 22% reduction in inventory costs. additionally, the system proved to respond to the factory’s necessities and allowed for real-time control of production and inventories.","e-kanban system, industry 4.0","and Future Work In this work a new e-Kanban system for production and stock management is presented and tested in an automotive manufacturer company. Its implementation intended to overcome the problems detected regarding priority definition, clients’ satisfaction, stock levels and synchronism between production and assembly lines. Since the company possesses in-house software development teams, it was ruled more cost-efficient to develop a new e-Kanban system internally rather than adapting an existing e-Kanban market software to their specific requirements. Moreover, it must be noted that, in the development of the new system, the limitations of previously implemented e-Kanban systems were considered. The detected limitations in the literature were analyzed and the following solutions proposed: • Limitation to only one urgency per production loop with the Urgent kanban label functionality. • The Logistics Planner is the only one with clearance to create/delete e-Kanban labels. • The existence of production boards with the order of production based on consumption, which facilitates the priority management activity. • The existence of stock boards which show the stock levels throughout the products’ production flows. • The creation of a user-friendly dashboard for the production operators. Once developed, the new system was tested in operating conditions for component 8 (C8), along a 3-month period. The results show that the stocks were reduced by 19% (which equals a 22% reduction in the cost related to stock), and that the number of parts shortages was also reduced, proving the benefits of a pull system compared to a push system. To the reduction of the latter, the automatic definition of priorities was also essential. Additionally, it was noted that the problems related to kanban labels’ loss were eliminated and that a real-time control of the component’s internal value chain was now possible. Also, the even distribution of stocks allowed for a mitigation of the demand variations’ impacts and permitted the synchronism between the production lines of the different processes. As future work and to further test the system, we propose its applications in the remaining factory components (C1 through C7). Additionally, to bring the system closer to Industry 4.0 requirements and reduce human errors related to the scanning process, the authors propose the introduction of RFID technology to track the CUs’ movements through the production. This way, instead of the operators having to scan each label, the RFID tags are placed in the containers and automatically trigger the state changes. As well, we propose the system’s connection to the factory’s ERP. This would allow for an autonomous update in the number of MTS labels according to the clients’ consumption and an automatic release to the production of the MTO labels based on the client’s deadlines.","bárbara romeira degeit, university of aveiro, campus universitário de santiago 3810-193, aveiro, portugal barbararomeira@ua.pt francisco cunha fsc consulting, portugal fr.santosdacunha@gmail.com ana moura govcopp / degeit, university of aveiro, campus universitário de santiago 3810-193, aveiro, portugal ana.moura@ua.pt","references. 
Although it happened less than before, the application of the e-Kanban system forced the weekly verification of the 
number of labels in each state and recalibration accordingly. Nevertheless, the tests showed that, with the new system, 
the factory was able to control and balance the stock level which addressed the impact of demand variations and 
allowed the synchronism between production stages. It also allowed real-time monitoring of production and inventory 
and, due to a 24-hour visibility, the production and logistics managers know what would be in production until the 
next 24 hours creating increased flexibility and responsiveness. Table 3 synthetizes the results obtained in this work.

87,The Impact Of Customer Loyalty And Satisfaction On  Performance At A Lighting Company,"the purpose of this research is to study the challenges that managers face daily at one of south lighting company, and how these challenges affect customer satisfaction. the research focuses more on organization which designs and manufactures lights. the hypothesis of the study is: delays in production has led to customer dissatisfaction. customers do not like waiting, because it is time-consuming, and disturbing. an interview was conducted with the production manager to statement the hypothesis. understanding what it takes to satisfy customers, however, mostly for service products, where human communications often assume considerable importance. as both the size of the service sector and the importance of customer service for manufacturing organization develop, it turns out to be more and more important to understand the complications of customer reactions to services. customer satisfaction survey must be conducted every twelve months to get numerical statistics for the quality indicators developed within the performance management framework of the company. the customer satisfaction index is further required to evaluate yearly performance targets for services delivered by green craft lighting.",customer loyalty,"There is no device to distinguish between a satisfied customer and a faithful customer. The existing model only reveals the loyalty constraints as part of customer satisfaction feedback, on the other hand does not reveal the term of relationship, and faithfulness. Feedback on satisfaction is provisional and limited to the development where the relationship cuts through the element and society and expected to develop over the period of relationship. Contributors might provide different meanings to the word customer satisfaction. The assumption of this research is that high levels of customer satisfaction can result in an increase of the marketplace share. The significance of customer satisfaction is that satisfied customers will always come to buy product from the company. It is not loyal customers who spend longer period, it is not expensive to keep customers joyful than trying to get a new customer. Satisfied customers are good for the organization’s stability. Therefore, the challenges that managers face in a daily basis at lighting company does not affect customer satisfaction because many customers are satisfied with the service and the quality of products delivered to them by the organization. This paper has recommended what is useful and can be done by other companies in relation to brand fairness, brand credibility, customer satisfaction, brand commitment, supposed quality, brand trust and brand loyalty. 6.Recommendations In this research study, customer satisfaction has been considered which is a very important element for the success of any business. • Establishing a good relationship with customers is an essential business strategy as they will also be loyal to the brand and the growth of an organization. • Employers need to instill quality departments and service companies it is important to have courtesy and know all the products being sold as it increases confidence in a customer. • Managers need to also consider customer service quality and price fairness as it leads to customer satisfaction. 0 100 Customers Will customers purchase again in the organization based on their experience Yes Unsure No Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management Monterrey, Mexico, November 3-5, 2021","khathutshelo mushavhanamadi, m. f. hlengani department of quality and operation management university of johannesburg, south africa kmushavhanamadi@uj.ac.za","References

88,The Impact Of Project Governance On Project Delivery In  The Enterprise Project Management Office Within South,"effective project governance and project management are fundamental mechanisms of ensuring that projects are successfully delivered within the project timelines. it involves a multifaceted set of relationships with stakeholders in an organization. project governance provides a structure through which project related objectives are set, and the means of accomplishing those are documented and prioritized. in summary, the purpose of this paper was to provide a comprehensive understanding through documentation and re- search on the impact of project governance impact on project delivery. the research also intends to increase awareness of the inherent risks associated with poor implementation of project governance which leads to poor project delivery and consequently project failures. a mixed- method research approach was under- taken where data was gathered through primary and secondary sources. a questionnaire was circulated in one of the branches in johannesburg enterprise project management office, to a population of 58 staff in epmo comprising of head of department, 6 senior project managers and 51 junior staff members. half of the respondents know the tools and techniques used by epmo and are readily in place to be used, but half neither agreed nor disagreed. almost all respondents indicated that the epmo does not have to change the current project management approach.","project management, bank, (rankins","This research shows that there is a project charter in place, there is communication in place, they have tools and techniques in place, there is senior management involvement in projects, there are several successful projects, and there are adequate stakeholder engagement and involvement. However, the research has indicated operational gaps within the project management process in EPMO where there have been operational inconsistencies which do not match the project governance process. 7. Recommendation The main implication for EPMO management is that there needs to be a department-wide training and education aware- ness on the EPMO project management value chain to give employees a view of how each role, each function, each project fits into the greater scope of EPMO. EPMO needs to create awareness of project administration and management and the difference with the day-to-day role requirements, and there needs to be aware on how to priorities projects to meet deadlines or focus on projects with high impact on business. Another implication for management is to decide how they will ensure that each staff member follows and adheres to project governance within the project programmers they are managing. They need to educate staff that EPMO culture is aligning to bank’s culture of not putting results before ethical conduct. Management needs to decide on how they will roll out a general approach to project governance in line with the Group Project Risk Management Framework and EPMO Strategy. There need to be effective escalation procedures in place for non-compliance because strong project management be- gins with a sound project plan which must include project governance management. Through the project charter, each stakeholder must have their clearly defined roles and responsibilities so that stakeholder engagement. There needs to be a steering committee that will oversee and monitor governance and give feedback every month. The department must also be open and willing to adjust when changes to the project governance processes are made, or changes are made to the framework or operational changes must be enforced. Tools and techniques to be used by EPMO will include the Group Project Risk Management Framework and the Project Management Framework.

92,A Cost-Benefit Approach To Thermo-Processing Equipment  Safety Regulation Analysis,"safety management of industrial fuel-fired thermo-processing equipment is important to protect workers, infrastructure and the environment. potential risks include fire and explosions which can be catastrophic if not managed. various regulatory agencies across the globe have introduced safety regulation such as nfpa 86, en 746 and sans 329 to enforce combustion safety requirements. like other regulations, these regulations are also experiencing resistance by firms. the main reason of resistance is the unjustifiable compliance costs. the aim of this study is to develop a customized model which can be applied to analyse the cost and benefits of fuel-fired thermo processing equipment safety regulations. the model consists of three components namely, process simulation, financial modelling and cost benefit analysis. process simulation is used to observe the performance of the compliant and non-compliant system. a financial model is used to observe the effect of process alterations on the cash flow of the project over a period. once all costs and benefits are projected a cost-benefit analysis can be performed to determine the net present value (npv) of the project. if npv > 0, it proves that safety regulation has financial benefit, and if npv < 0, the project must be rejected. when comparing different alternatives such as project a and b, if npv(a) > npv(b), project a must be chosen and vice versa.","safety, simulation","Safety regulations are important to manage risks in industrial activities. Often, they face resistance due to unjustifiable high compliance costs and intense administration requirements. To curb this perception a CBA model can be used to analyse the benefits and educate firms. A process simulation is a method which can be used to investigate the effect of the alterations that comes with regulation on the process. This is a simple method to substitute very costly and timeous experimentation. Once all the alterations in the operation of process are know they can be translated in monetary terms using a financial model to investigate their effect on the cash flow of the firm. NPV, BCR and IRR are also useful tools to also aid in decision making process by investigating whether regulatory compliance is financially beneficial. If NPV>0, the project must be implemented, and if NPV <0, the project must be rejected. When comparing different alternatives, if NPV(A) > NPV(B), project A must be chosen and vice versa. Same applies to BCR, if BCR > 1, the project must be implemented, if BCR < 1, the project must be rejected. When the IRR, is greater than the cost of financing the project, the project should be implemented. MCDA is suitable to assess intangible benefits of different alternatives. An alternative with a higher averaged weighted score should be preferred. However, safety is considered a non-negotiable principle in a workplace. Even if a CBA study can prove that a safety regulation is not financially beneficial to the firm, the regulation must still be complied with. However, management of firm will make informed decision and implementing safety project knowing exactly what to expect. The model can be useful as well to regulatory agencies to make their own assessment as well prior to releasing new regulation and enforcing. 5.

93,Data Driven Supply Chain Optimization A Case Study,"logistics and the supply chain performance is very important in the hazmat industry. the end customer of hazardous materials is a wide range of industries from aerospace, automotive, craftsmen, healthcare, food and beverage, pharma and energy. effectiveness of logistics is crucial to the performance of the supply chain. logistic costs in the chemical industry can be as high as 20% of the purchase costs due to the complexity and risks involved. therefore, cost-effective supply chain decisions and policies are essential to a profitable business. the company under study is an industry leader in hazmat products, it produces and distributes them. the organization has three main business lines: wholesale, bulk and retail. the corporation has presence in more than 90 countries. the research will be focused on the operations in north america and in the bulk business line. the bulk business line consists in tanks installed in different spots (customers) across the country and based on product consumption and telemetry readings the tanks are refilled by trucks. the tanks inventory is managed by the vendor under a vmi supply agreement. the logistics process consists in the following: [1] each tank has a telemetry system that records the tank levels every hour and this information is available online. [2] the logistics planner checks tank levels and decides which customers need refill and plans routes for the next day. [3] the first step in all trips is to refill the truck with product. [4] then, the product is in route to the customers. on average a trip has 2-3 deliveries and last about 2 days on average. [5] the driver closes each delivery through an app and the amount delivered is sent to the erp for invoicing. it is important to take advantage of the wide range of existing degrees of freedom due to the nature of a vmi system, since the company decides when to deliver to the customer based on the level of inventory in the tank, how much product to deliver and how to combine the different customers to generate the route plan. for this research, three main areas were explored: reorder point, fleet sizing and routing. currently all delivery points are set on a standard reorder point without taking into account the lead time and demand for each customer. so, an inventory policy with continuous review is proposed. second, the company hires a third-party carrier and is able to set the number of base and spot vehicles rented per month. all base units have a certain number of kilometers as a take-or-pay, spot units pay only the kilometers driven. as the second solution, we present a formula to estimate fleet size based on the forecasted demand, round trip time and tanker capacity. finally, all routing plans are done manually by the logistic planners. so, a simulation was done using a routing optimization model to minimize the total travel cost for a month worth of deliveries.","hazmat, vmi, supply chain, cost reduction",,"sandra n. garza almazán and edgar m.a. granda gutiérrez department of engineering universidad de monterrey monterrey, nuevo león 66238, méxico sandra.garza@udem.edu, edgar.granda@udem.edu",

95,An Instrument To Measure Work Stress On Mexican  Academic Staff,"having a paid job is, for most people's work, a source of economic security, status, well-being and health. it gives meaning to their lives, but at times it can be a physical and / or mental burden, and a source of frustration, conflict, disappointment, physical and mental discomfort, and even death. these discomforts are sometimes referred to as job pressure, or better known as job stress. the purpose of this study is to build an instrument to measure the relationships of five specific organizational factors impact on the job stress of teaching staff in higher education institutions in the metropolitan area of monterrey, which amounts up to 19,372 individuals. the variables we considered to be related to work stress are job insecurity, work overload, procedural justice, work-family conflict and insufficient rewards. the results that will be obtained from this research will serve the universities for the planning of strategies to prevent work stress, which has negative consequences at the individual and organizational level.","work stress, job insecurity, work overload",,"césar eduardo perales martínez; maría mayela terán cázares; evelin anahí torres torres ciencias económico y administrativo facultad de contaduría pública y administración monterrey, méxico av. universidad s/n cd. universidad, san nicolás de los garza, nuevo león, méxico. cesareduardoperales@hotmail.com; mayela.teran@gmail.com; evelintorres1@hotmail.com",
96,Analysis Of Building Construction In A Colombian Case From  A Total Quality Management Perspective,"the objective of this study was to present some proposals for the building construction sector in colombia that would mitigate the problems in this sector and reduce the possibility of building collapse in the country. the study carried out a literature review on the barriers and critical success factors (csf) for the implementation of total quality management (tqm) in the construction sector in different geographical contexts. based on the 12 barriers and 8 identified success factors, the existence of these aspects was evaluated in the case of the collapse of the space building located in medellín, colombia. as a result, the importance and consequences, both positive and negative, of the implementation of tqm in this sub-sector can be particularly evidenced.","construction, barriers","In general, in construction companies, the implementation of quality management and control aims to improve processes and results, in order to make them more competent and achieve a good economic performance and a high satisfaction of the actors involved, such as clients, suppliers and investors. For this reason, in addition to the ISO 9001 certification, as evidenced by the methodology and results of the case in the Space building, it is essential that companies in the construction sector in Colombia are committed to the acquisition of knowledge, training and implementation of the CSF, which must be implemented throughout the entire construction process, from design and procurement of inputs and materials to the execution of the project. It is worth noting that most of the problems originated in top management: poor or deficient communication within the organisation, lack of control bodies to verify the quality of materials and finally the quality of the construction process. One of the possible solutions to all these events, as observed in the proposals of this paper, is the implementation of quality control and management methodologies. The lack of qualified labour requires continuous supervision. On the other hand, control by external agents is also needed, mainly from the curators who have the obligation to review all the plans, specifications, and calculations of the structure. It should be demonstrated that at least the approach of the work is complying with the current seismic resistant standard, to avoid catastrophes such as the one in the Space building. The lack of general and case studies and research on the construction industry from the TQM perspective in Colombia was identified. Despite this, the usefulness of this type of study for society in general was also recognised. By making this type of situation visible, the learning generated can be shared with the interested public in the form of a final report showing the lessons learned from the work, together with the development of the solution that successfully overcame the situation presented. This is recommended for all projects, not only those that did not meet quality and service standards, but also those in which the difficulties were minor and had no major complications in their execution.","julián david gonzález zapata, bertha viviana ruales guzmán, lina patricia velasquez mora department of computer and industrial engineering universidad nacional de colombia bogotá d.c., colombia jdgonzalezza@unal.edu.co, bvrualesg@unal.edu.co, lpvelzquezmo@unal.edu.co laura milena hernández castañeda department of civil and agricultural engineering universidad nacional de colombia bogotá d.c., colombia laumhernandezcas@unal.edu.co",

99,"Digital Competences Of Teachers In Universities In Times Of  Covid-19, Cusco-Peru, 2020","the research includes the digital competences of university teachers, whose objective was to describe the level of digital competences of teachers of the universities of cusco-peru in times of covid-19. the research method was quantitative approach making use of statistical analysis, descriptive scope for which the characteristics of the study unit were identified, of non-experimental design since the research was carried out without deliberate manipulation of the study variable, observing it in its natural and cross-sectional context as it is carried out in a specific time frame. the study population was made up of 2,740 students corresponding to the professional schools of administration, international business, economics, marketing, accounting and administrative sciences of the universities of cusco in the virtual modality, there is a representative random sample of 886 students with a level 97% confidence level and 3% maximum estimation error, the research technique was the survey, the data collection instrument was the virtual questionnaire, and the spss statistical software was used for information processing. the most significant and relevant findings in the research correspond to the digital competences of university teachers considered high with 35.10% and very high with 32.10%, since professional commitment is relevant in the development of the teaching- learning process with the use of digital resources, the digital pedagogy used by teachers in evaluation and feedback that allows to empower students and continuously strengthen students' digital competence. another of the findings obtained in the research corresponds to the professional commitment, which is the digital competence developed by the teachers with 83% that is evidenced through the dedication and commitment in the development of their teaching work using digital tools. on the other hand, it is shown that the evaluation and feedback process is considered by 72.50%, which is equivalent to a very low, low, and regular level, evidencing a low level of use of digital resources to innovate in the application of evaluations and feedback. the research is relevant as a contribution to further studies and to take corrective measures if necessary.","digital competences, digital pedagogy, mexico, november 3-5","According to the results obtained in the surveys, it is concluded that the teachers of the Faculty of Economic, Administrative and Accounting Sciences of the Universities of Cusco are trained in digital skills, being high and very high in 67.2% due to the professional commitment during the development of the teaching-learning process in the professional training of students and the use of technological tools. It is concluded that professional commitment is high and very high in 83% according to the results obtained, since it allows teachers to use digital technologies not only at the University but also in their day to day, for their individual and collective professional development. Teachers within the variety of digital resources have selected what is best adapted for each subject they teach, each group of students and their teaching style. Likewise, they make use of the security regulations in terms of data protection and sensitivity of critical data when using shared files and in research topics in the same way they indicate to students respect for copyright. All this is reflected as high and very high with 72.7% obtained as a result of the study. Digital pedagogy corresponds to 78.6% according to the result obtained is high and very high, which indicates the use of technologies effectively during the planning and execution of the activities of the teaching-learning process. Regarding the evaluation and feedback, a 72.50% was obtained, which is equivalent to a very low, low and regular level, evidencing a low level of use of digital resources to innovate in the application of evaluations and feedback. Only 27.5% of teachers make optimal use of digital resources to innovate in the application of evaluations, although this is a critical point in the teaching-learning process, it must be complemented with individual or collective feedback, thus achieving better perception by students. In the same way, in terms of empowering students in the use of digital technologies, a high and very high result has been obtained with a 52.1% response in the surveys, which indicates that not all teachers actively involve students in the use of technologies to create or explain a new topic or promote their transversal skills, being important that the participation of students can be promoted. Finally, we can see that facilitating digital competence in students is high and very high with 65.7% in the surveys, this being a transversal competence that teachers need to teach students the proper use of digital technologies: the creation of content, responsible use, digital problem solving, information literacy and digital communication; All of this will allow students to use digital resources effectively and efficiently.","elena sonia paula espinoza ríos, felipe néstor gutarra meza, miriam ingrid espinoza vilca escuela académico profesional de ingeniería de sistemas e informática universidad continental av. san carlos 1980, urb. san antonio, huancayo, perú eespinozar@continental.edu.pe, fgutarra@continental.edu.pe, mespinozav@ucontinental.edu.pe vilma canahuire montufar escuela profesional de ciencias administrativas universidad nacional de san antonio abad del cusco av. de la cultura 773, cusco, perú vilma.canahuire@unsaac.edu.pe",

The results show that the proposed SPSA algorithm maximizes the (𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆 ෣) for the four case studies in this research. Another objective of this work is to improve by at least 10% the results reported by the authors of each case study analyzed. It is important to highlight that this objective was not achieved. However, there were improvements, greater than 2% for model 1, greater than 1% in model 3, and greater than 7% in model 4, only in model 2 there was no percentage improvement. Furthermore, the succession measures that converge on the maximum values of the variable (𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆 ෣) that its combinations of experiments of the succession measures for the proposed SPSA algorithm in the four case studies are 3 and 5. Finally, the results obtained show that the proposed SPSA algorithm is an easily implemented, efficient, and iterative method, which can be considered as an experimental tool for the improvement of quality indices that evaluate the aptitude of the processes within the Six Sigma methodology. Future research should propose a Stochastic Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (SPSA) algorithm capable of working with discrete and mixed controllable factors, and that is robust to the process quality indices to be optimized with the succession measures evaluated in this research.","algorithm juan carlos castillo garcía, jesús everardo olguín tiznado faculty of engineering, architecture, and design, autonomous university of baja california, carretera transpeninsular ensenada - tijuana no. 3917 colonia playitas, 22860 ensenada, baja california méxico. carlos.castillo@uabc.edu.mx, jeol79@uabc.edu.mx jorge luis garcía alcaraz, jose roberto díaz reza department of industrial engineering and manufacturing, autonomous university of ciudad juárez, ciudad juárez 32310, méxico jorge.garcia@uacj.mx, jose.dr01@itcj.edu.mx arturo realyvasquez vargas department of industrial engineering tecnológico nacional de méxico/i.t. tijuana tijuana, baja california 22414, méxico arturo.realyvazquez@tectijuana.edu.mx karina cecilia arredondo soto chemical sciences and engineering faculty universidad autónoma de baja california calzada universidad 14418, parque industrial internacional, tijuana, baja california 22390, méxico karina.arredondo@uabc.edu.mx",

103,Application Of Agile Methodologies For Design And  Development Of Healthtech Products: Bio Testing Device,"agile methodologies center around the concept of iterative development, where requirements and solutions evolve as project advances in its development. the big advantage of agile development is that it allows teams to deliver value faster, with higher quality, predictability, and with a better ability to respond to change. agile methodologies have been widely used in software industries where they have had proven results. however, development of new technological devices for the healthcare industry is traditionally a very long and arduous process that takes years from its conception to its market release. the use of agile frameworks has the potential to dramatically reduce the time to market for healthtech products as well as improve the final product. this thesis is a study of agile methodologies in the development of healthtech products. this involves a study of the current literature of how agile methodologies are currently applied and the application of said methods to the design and development of a new biotesting device by using scrum and agile digital boards. the result is the development of a uti diagnostic device and a thorough analysis of the advantages and pitfalls that the use of agile methodologies had in the design and development of this new product.","agile methodologies, scrum, health tech",,"catalina de león santos, sergio eduardo anaya alvarez, azael jesus cortes capetillo, david güemes-castorena, jorge de-j lozoya-santos escuela de ingeniería y ciencias tecnologico de monterrey monterrey, n.l. 64849, méxico a01192396@itesm.mx, a01176117@itesm.mx, azael.capetillo@tec.mx, guemes@tec.mx, jorge.lozoya@tec.mx",
104,Science Fiction And Innovation: Prototyping The Future  From Uncertainty,"science fiction is an instrument for innovation. it has inspired generations to endorse the value of science and it has helped shape the future through the unceasing speculation of what it could look like. in recent years, science fiction has been employed as a tool for design. as a device to explore alternative future scenarios, it encourages developing solutions that require groundbreaking thinking. additionally, it serves as a resource to discuss the ramifications of the technological innovations that it prompted in the first place. innovation is repeatedly labeled as the process that uses the current knowledge and technologies to create something new or improve something existing. however, the innovation process is fraught with uncertainty, mainly when dealing with sci-fi methods. the knowledge of the future will always be incomplete, and there will always be technologies that will remain undiscovered by the time the prototyping occurs. what if instead of trying to abate that technological and knowledge uncertainty, we could adopt them as agents of the model to create better futures? to date there is no standard approach that considers these two criteria of uncertainty as the vehicle to achieve different results. moreover, previous research considers them as objectionable aspects. this paper proposes a new methodology based on the assumption that developing new products challenging the future and its unpredictability is possible. furthermore, taking advantage of the uncertainty that this process inevitably involves, it is attainable to discover and build the path to the technological development of the sci- fi ideated product. to construct and evaluate the usability of this tool it was necessary to: i) track the leverage of popular sci-fi technologies and its mutual influence in innovation, ii) review and synthesize previous studies and methodologies, iii) create a new methodology, iv) design a specialized workshop to test it, and v) map the path through which determined sci-fi ideas have the potential to become a reality.","science fiction, technology, innovation",,"sinai galeana, azael capetillo and david güemes-castorena school of engineering and sciences tecnologico de monterrey av. eugenio garza sada 2501 sur, tecnológico, 64849 monterrey, n.l, méxico a01655250@itesm.mx, azael.capetillo@tec.mx, guemes@tec.mx",
105,Design Of An Electronics Swapping System For Electric  Guitars,"the electronic components of electric guitars have a notorious influence on the sounds that can be produced with them. on the other hand, floating bridges allow the user to change the pitch by moving one end of the strings/varying the applied tension; floating bridges that work with springs located at the guitar rear are the most common. to improve the sonic capabilities of the guitar, it was designed an electronic swapping system that compatible with a rear springs bridge configuration. the design method used combined the pahl & beitz requirements approach with the excitement feature concept of the kano model. this article presents the design of a guitar body with a side-removable module that contains the entire electronic system and can be swapped without removing the guitar strings.","design methodology, electric guitar","This design allows to easily swap the whole electronics system in a guitar equipped with the most versatile floating bridge configuration in the market, therefore, it combines in a single instrument feature that otherwise would require multiple guitars. The functional analysis of the body showed that each guitar body portion has its functions and ways to interact with the user. There is a specific portion that storage the electronics and supports the guitar when the player performs seated. The usage of just a metal box for portion C allowed to get a big empty space for the electronics system and provides electromagnetic isolation; this configuration is advised even for instruments that do not include an electronic swapping system. The electronics storage proposal has enough space behind the strings for up to four standard size humbucker pickups; additionally, the empty space in section C allows to place knobs and switches without interfering with the user plucking hand, as well as a 9 V battery and some active circuits. It is hard to say if the proposed design is compatible with sustainer systems. Although there have been guitars with so much aluminum that the circulating electrical currents were dissipated before they reached the bridge pickup (i.e. the sustainer driver), the usage of non-magnetic metals near the pickups is not recommended in guitars that include a Sustainiac (Sustainiac, 2018). Testing and simulations are requiered to determine this compatibility. For this particular design, it was considered to place the tuning elements at the guitar body (commonly referred as headless configuration), this configuration has been used in ergonomic instrument design (Genani, 2013). This disposal allows to reduce the guitar body weight easily than the traditional configuration. Future design iterations may consider the optimization of the aluminum frame, as well as the usage of other high strength materials. Finally, it is important to mention that there are floating bridges that do not obstruct the rear face of the guitar, but most of them are not as versatile as the rear springs’ configuration.

106,Analysis Of The Correlation Between Imposter Syndrome  And Grade Level Of Online High School Students,"this project investigates the commonality and effect of imposter syndrome in the students of online high schools, using stanford university online high school (ohs) as a sample. multiple scientific studies define imposter syndrome in similar ways, and it is estimated that 70% of people experience this phenomenon in their lives. however, imposter syndrome has rarely been investigated in such a young demographic before, nor in online school students, and therefore this project aims to spread awareness about the prevalence of imposter syndrome in online high school students. the variables include grade level, experiencing imposter syndrome, and where a student experienced it (at school, home, extracurriculars, etc.). the data sampled through an anonymous survey was investigated through 10 statistical tests: 9 chi-square tests, and 1 kruskal-wallis test. ohs students, on average, are statistically significantly more likely to experience imposter syndrome than the “average” person. however, the 7th and 8th-grade samples showed no statistically significant difference from the expected results. this data supports the alternative hypothesis that online high schoolers are more likely to experience imposter syndrome, which was reasoned to be due to the more difficult and higher amount of work, as well as the mounting pressure to achieve success.","imposter syndrome, mental health, or imposter","Overall, the students of Stanford Online High School demonstrated a statistically significant difference in the presence of imposter syndrome compared to the estimated average of 70% per population. When looking at the question of “Have you ever felt Imposter Syndrome in your life?”, the positive “Yes” answers across all grade levels, and the total, showed a statistically significant difference from the norm. The negative “No” answers across the total and grade levels demonstrated a statistically highly significant difference from the expected results. From this, we can see that OHS students, on average, are much more likely to experience imposter syndrome than the “average” person. This indicates that the null hypothesis can be rejected, and the alternative hypothesis accepted. However, once we break these results down by grade level, we see different results, some statistically significant and others not, a phenomenon similar to Simpson’s Paradox. The 7th and 8th-grade samples showed no statistically significant difference from the expected results. However, all the high school students’ results (9th-12th grade) demonstrated a statistically significant difference from the expected results, as the observed number of “Yes” answers were much higher than the expected rate of 70%. A conclusion can be drawn that OHS middle school students experience less imposter syndrome than OHS high school students, as being at OHS has not yet influenced their likelihood to develop those feelings. This supports the alternative hypothesis again and likely demonstrates that high schoolers are more likely to experience imposter syndrome, potentially caused by the more difficult courses and higher amount of work, as well as the greater pressure to achieve as they near adulthood. However, it may not show that the alternative hypothesis, that all OHSers are more likely to do so than the “average” person, is more likely to be true. Additionally, the Kruskal-Wallis test showed that there was no statistically significant difference between how many students answered per grade level and the location they chose, based on the 4 most common combinations of answers. No matter where they have experienced the imposter syndrome, there is approximately the same number of people per grade level who chose each location. Because Stanford Online High School students demonstrate a higher likelihood of experiencing imposter syndrome, other online high school students may as well, and awareness about the prevalence of this issue in adolescents should be spread to help the students counteract and cope with the imposter syndrome. 5. Future Research Finally, if this project was redone, several aspects would be changed to control more variables, as well as to run more statistical tests. First, all the survey answers should be from an average-workload period, perhaps across two weeks, so that there is not too much fluctuation in student’s emotions based on approaching finals or a recent break. Secondly, an even greater sample size would be gathered, especially of 7th-graders, so that the sample results may more accurately represent the whole population. Even within the three variables which were investigated in this project, there are many more opportunities to run statistical tests. For example, Kruskal-Wallis tests could be run to compare each grade level’s answers to “Have you ever felt Imposter Syndrome in your life?”, or even just between high school students or middle school students (Mann-Whitney for two samples). There were many other variables involved in my survey which were not subjected to statistical testing, such as the various causes and effects of imposter syndrome, as well as whether the student has found someone to help them cope, and who this is. A further investigation into this would be both interesting and beneficial to find the root of these issues and more effective ways to deal with them.

107,Evaluation Of The Feasibility Of Centralization Of  Warehouses In The Construction Company Vidusa.,"this document presents a research project that consisted of verifying the logistical viability of centralizing warehouses in a construction company called vidusa. the project was carried out in stages, the first stage consisted in structuring the statement of the problem by collecting as much relevant information as possible through interviews, observation and historical data such as volume flow of building materials, the location of the warehouses, the home construction projection, etc. in order to understand the processes of the company and how it operates; the next stage consisted in analyzing the information, first, to find out where to put the centralized warehouse, the median p model was used, which seeks to minimize the distance between warehouses taking into account the construction of houses per year in each construction site. this model was run in python, in a google library called or-tools, which allows to run mixed integer problems (mip). once the location of the new centralized warehouse was selected, the vehicle routing problem with time windows (vrptw) was run to find out the route to follow to deliver the building materials to the construction site. in which the number of vehicles, the delivery time windows of each site, the daily volumetric demand and the volumetric capacity of the vehicle were taken into account. restrictions were added so the model could decide whether or not to visit a construction site and for the number of vehicles to use. the model was also run in python. once done the analysis of the operations and the supplies used in the constructions of housing along with the results obtained in the mathematical model, the project proceeded with the design of the warehouse in factorycad using as template an actual warehouse that vidusa already owns. on this design were considered the changes the actual process will have, like the use of a loading dock for each of the routes the warehouse will have, this to facilitate the load of the trucks. also, how the supplies will be transported and organized inside the warehouse. the feasibility of the project was determined by comparing the costs of the initial investment and the costs of the operations involved in the current situation versus the proposed solution. the costs compared were the price of the equipment required (e.g., cantilevers, vehicles, lift trucks, etc.), the maintenance, services, fuel, among others. the analysis was carried out by simulating 5 years of the two scenarios and verifying if the proposed solution would impact the operating and investment cost of the current situation by reducing them.","warehouses, financial, vrptw, feasibility","The Dynamic Synthesis Methodology facilitated the process of analysis, giving the structure necessary for the project. In the first step the establishment of the objectives was crucial, this way the range of the project was delimited. Also, it was possible to identify where the problem was and be able to structure it. The second stage of the project consisted of analyzing the information collected and building the models in order to determine a solution proposal. The most important thing in this stage was the establishment of the assumptions since the solution depends completely on them. At this stage, all relevant aspects that affect the operation of the warehouses were identified and analyzed to obtain the cost of the current operation of the company, salaries, infrastructure, security, among others. The next stage is the design proposal, after several visits to warehouses and to Taller Mecánico, the best practices of each were determined to be replicated, a first sketch was worked which began as a replica of the Taller Mecánico warehouse, during the process requirements were added according to the result of the models and the assumptions that were established. The most important part of this stage is to be able to design a proposal considering all the points of view, from the people who are on the construction site, the architects who plan the taks, the managers of the warehouses, etc. The first two objectives were accomplished in this stage, the centralization of warehouses allows the construction of houses in series and the replicable model was realized. Another important part is to verify the financial viability, the improvement should be reflected in an increase in profits, which in this case is due to cost reduction. In the financial analysis, all the factors that generate expenses were identified, either for initial investment or for operating expenses. In the end, the expenses per year are converted to present value in order to be able to be compared with each other and to determine a decision. The result of the simulation showed that the centralization of warehouses is feasible because there is a cost reduction of approximately 20%; This is based on the estimates described in the previous sections as well as the established assumptions. The last objective was accomplished, the implementation is feasible in cost-benefit terms. This is unique research because it involves multiple analysis, first the location-allocation model, then the VRPTW. It's important to mention that these models were run in python. And finally, a complete financial analysis in order to decide the best option for the company.","ana paula ocañas morales, brando m. rodríguez vallejo, ricardo c. lozano cantú business management engineering, industrial and systems engineering, industrial and systems engineering university of monterrey, méxico ana.ocanas@udem.edu, brando.rodriguez@udem.edu, ricardoc.lozano@udem.edu msc. refugio chávez hernández doctorate in supply chain management and logistics, university of monterrey, méxico. refugio.chavez@udem.edu",
108,Strategic Value Propositions To Increase Competitiveness In  A Tourism Cluster,"tourism is industrial sector that has been strongly affected in the last year. due to the new normal, and the needs to maintain the safety of visitors, restrictions especially for tourist trips have been decreased. mexico is positioned as the sixth most important destination worldwide, concentrating a significant and growing number of visitors worldwide. (omt, 2018). tourism gdp for mexico contributes 8.7% in 2019 on the economy of the country but during the second and third trimester of 2020 the indicator decreased 47%, which is complemented by the growth of the original gdp for the tertiary cluster where it shows a growth of 2.87% in 2019 and decreased in 3.4% during 2020. with these parameters the impact of the tourism cluster on the generation of income that drives economic clusters and revitalize society. (datatur sectur, 2019). the present approach defines a strategic alternative on the execution of services in non-traditional clusters, being tourism a cluster with a new business vision and an alternative for local development, becoming an important axis that links industries and services energizing economy worldwide. applying mainly porter´s models and tools to analyze and design a strategic initiatives and projects to revitalize the tourism in mexican southern area, and creating value chains to support and improve social development, is the main approach of this research. using the diamond model, five forces analysis, the cluster mapping and other significant tools, this paper presents a strategy to create a new growth model based on clusters development and the recommended creation of specific sub clusters. the results of the research are a long term plan and the proposal of new policies to keep growing in region.","cluster, competitiveness, value chain",,"teresa verduzco-garza industrial engineering, engineering school university of monterrey udem san pedro garza garcia, nl, méxico teresa.verduzco@udem.edu j. gerardo rodríguez beltrán and josé pablo nuño de la parra popular autonomous university of puebla upaep puebla, pue, mexico jesusgerardo.rodriguez01@upaep.edu.mx ; pablo.nuno@upaep.mx","References

109,Establishing Risks Of Food Supply Chains For Small And  Medium Food Manufacturing Companies In Malaysia,"the supply chain is a network that involves organizations, resources, activities and technologies in the creation and sale of products, from suppliers of raw materials to subsequent manufacturers to consumers through delivery. however, supply chains are often vulnerable to risk of uncertainty. risk in the supply chain is the exposure to the occurrence of a loss or injury that would affect the overall supply chain of the supply chain. in this study, the supply chain is assessed through analysis of the risks occurring in the supply chain in the real industry. the purpose of this study is to identify the existing risks in the supply chain in the food manufacturing industry in malaysia. this study was conducted through interviews and questionnaires. information and data obtained are used for risk analysis to identify the types of risks encountered in the supply chain through the analytical hierarchical process technique (ahp) method. in conclusion, the risk analysis in the supply chain can determine the highest risk types in the supply chain which is the risk of competition among companies (53%) and factors that cause such risks are competition from other manufacturers (86%) as well as market entry (14%). furthermore, measures to overcome and mitigate these hazards can be carried out once risks are identified.","food supply chain, food manufacturing","In conclusion, supply chain analysis in the industry is important so that the journey of a company runs smoothly in producing quality products and can meet customer demand. This analysis includes in terms of studies on supply chain mapping as well as risk analysis occurring in the food manufacturing industry. Next, measures to prevent need to be taken and must be emphasized so that the risk can be reduced and in turn can be avoided from happening bear times. In this study, the objectives that have been set have been achieved. For the first objective, supply chain network mapping was done based on the selected companies where the mapping focused on one key product from that company. Furthermore, for the second objective, the type of risk that occurs in the supply chain and also the causal factors for each risk can be identified using data obtained during the visit, interviews conducted and also through questionnaires that have been distributed to companies. which is studied.

112,Real Fuel Consumption In The Main Logistic Corridors Of  Colombia,"fleet managers state that fuel consumption accounts for 50% of the operating costs of their cargo and passenger vehicle fleets. aiming to reduce these costs, transport companies contract telematics services to track their units and monitor fuel consumption along with other variables. the gathered information is used to alert managers on events like excessive fuel consumption, abrupt breaks and needs of mechanical maintenance. we propose the use of this information to determine the fuel consumption of cargo vehicles at each km of the main roads of a given region and the influence of altitude, road grade and vehicle age on it. as a case study we studied the fuel consumption in the main logistic corridor of colombia which are characterized by having a highly variable topography. toward that end, we compared the fuel consumption monitored by a telematic system on 46 vehicles of different cargo capacity with the estimated by an energy balance model and observed that they are highly correlated (r2>0.99). then, we used the calibrated model to obtain the km-by-km fuel consumption. this information is used by authorities to obtain a close estimation of the cost of cargo transport, the greenhouse gases emissions, and to identify locations with unusual high fuel consumption. furthermore, the slope of the linear correlation (cf) decouples the fuel consumption associated to driving style (human factors) from other influencing factors. then, we observed that the effects of altitude and vehicle age on fuel consumption are negligible and that most of the vehicle technologies studied has not improved in practice their real energy performance during the last 20 years.","freight transport, telematics, mexico",,"josé i. huertas, oscar serrano-guevara, jenny díaz-ramírez, daniel prato, lina tabares energy and climate change research group, school of engineering and sciences, tecnologico de monterrey, monterrey 64849, a00829611@itesm.mx department of engineering, universidad de monterrey, monterrey, méxico. jenny.diaz@udem.edu innovation department, latin american center for innovation in logistics – cli – logyca, bogotá, colombia, dprato@logyca.org connected fleet department, michelin, bogotá, colombia, lina.tabares-rodriguez@michelin.com correspondence jhuertas@tec.mx",
113,Designing A Data Governance Model To Implement Gdpr In  Sri Lankan Enterprises,"the volume and complexity of data have expanded while demanding the need for specialized data protection solutions for many data-driven enterprises. personal data is the internet's new oil and the digital world's new currency, has a big impact on privacy and security. various laws have been implemented in many nations to protect people's personal information. one of them is gdpr (general data protection regulation), which is particularly relevant for eu data processing businesses. though it does not apply directly to sri lanka, it is directly applied to european union counterparties. to avoid losing business with the eu, sri lanka must also comply with gdpr. although there aren't many resources for gdpr implementation guidance, the existing ones are not very comprehensive. to resolve the issue, we went through a series of processes to construct a comprehensive model, after which we were able to develop a data governance model to deploy. the data governance model provides extensive direction for data management. we established the indicators and drivers that must be observed while applying the gdpr principles through interviews with industry professionals and completing an extensive literature study. a data governance model is provided in this study for data-driven organizations to simply implement compliance.","data governance, data privacy","The study comes to a close with a general conclusion, followed by a discussion of the study's limits and contributions. The chapter comes to a close with research recommendations. Various measures have been used to apply the Regulation in organizations, depending on the terms of the Regulation, the organizations' starting circumstances, and their needs. The success of the implementation is determined by elements such as the amount of time and resources given to it, as well as organizational structures and the implementation of indicators precisely. Through the conducted interviews as well we intend to gather more indicators on how each principle could be incorporated to a data governance model. Incorporating, all these factors into a data governance model makes it more convenient for the organization to make themselves GDPR compliant. Either the organizations could adopt the model, else they can use the model as guidance for their compliance implementation by doing a gap assessment with the existing governance model. Based on the findings and limitations of this study, more research into how businesses align themselves with data protection and their data protection agility could be conducted. It may be advantageous to assess employees' understanding of data security and the threat it poses to businesses in the event of data breaches or other similar situations.","p.a.indhumini ranathunga department of industrial management, faculty of science, university of kelaniya, sri lanka indhumini97@gmail.com dr.ruwan wickramarachchi senior lecturer, department of industrial management, faculty of science, university of kelaniya, sri lanka ruwan@kln.ac.lk","references.

116,Participatory Ergonomics In A Manufacturing Company  In Peru,"to improve working conditions at the welding station in a manufacturing company, the participatory ergonomics methodology was used to improve the working conditions of a manufacturing company. for its application, we used techniques such as observation and surveys. relevant measures at the station that did not adapt to the anthropometry of the worker were identified, as well as risks, such as congested working area, inadequate work postures, highly repetitive tasks and uncomfortable chairs. the intervention demonstrates that the problems can be identified and solutions can be carried out by applying this methodology, due to the worker’s involvement in the process and the commitment of the top management to develop them.",station analysis,"The pilot intervention result was satisfactory. Through it, the management team learned about participatory ergonomics as an appropriate strategy to integrate occupational risk prevention in the workplace, agreeing to develop the proposed program on a larger scale. The opinion of the supervisors and the commitment of management in the improvement of working conditions, ensure the maintenance of the actions undertaken. The changes in the design of the workstation improve the workstation conditions, in this way the operator no longer bends down to pick up pieces, and no longer raises his arm to leave pieces in the containers or pick up other pieces. Workstations are in order, avoiding the loss of time in the selection of parts for assembly, as well having as greater fluidity of materials between positions. The participation of workers in the application of this methodology favours its implementation and maintenance accommodation time of the products in process, therefore, the reduction of lost time and improvements in working conditions increase productivity. The Kaizen as a methodology of continuous improvement implemented in the plant facilitates the adoption of participatory ergonomics, in this intervention it was confirmed that senior management gives permanent support to this type of improvement. Although from a better design of the work station, it has been possible to demonstrate the improvement of productivity, as well as a favorable opinion of the workers, the direct benefits such as the elimination of cumulative traumas, should be evaluated in the medium term. It is recommended to continue with the ERGOPAR program for the other workstations in the plant and from the results develop a methodology applicable to processes involving the work of man and machine. The possibility of a study supported by software such as the Motion Analysis System to systematize the quantitative analysis is also open. Recognition The work team thanks the company FACUSA (https://www.facusa.com.pe) for being able to carry out this pilot study of participatory ergonomics intervention.","maría teresa noriega araníbar and bertha díaz garay industrial engineering program universidad de lima surco, lima, perú manorieg@ulima.edu.pe and bdiaz@ulima.edu.pe",

118,Evaluation Of An Electric Go-Kart With Lithium-Ion   And Nickel-Metal Hydride Batteries,"within the transition towards the use of electricity as a power source in the automotive industry, this investigation aims to evaluate the acceleration capacity of a go-kart type vehicle equipped with an electric motor. two types of battery were employed, lithium-ion and nickel-metal hydride batteries, each one combined with two different gear ratios. two methodologies were used to obtain the acceleration capacity, a mathematical model using simulink and track tests. the best acceleration capacity was obtained with lithium-ion batteries and a gear ratio of 2:1. the difference between the model and on-track tests were 16.68%. the difference is higher with a 1:1 gear ratio. was attributed to the initial energy requirement of the batteries when starting the vehicle to overcome inertia.","vehicle dynamics, go-kart","The results of acceleration capacity tests obtained on track compared with those obtained from the vehicle dynamics model show that the model predicts the speed reached with a percentage variation of up to 16.68%. Therefore, corroborating that the most effective of the combinations is the one that uses Lithium-Ion batteries and a transmission ratio of 2:1. According to the bibliography consulted, the total transmission efficiency was 90%, assuming that this efficiency represents possible faults in the optimal alignment and assembly of the drive shaft sprocket concerning the driven shaft sprocket and generating undesired resistive stresses in the transmission chain. The results obtained in the tests and the simulation are higher in the 1:1 transmission ratio concerning the 2:1 transmission ratio because it is attributed to the initial energy required to move the vehicle and overcome the inertia.

121,Performance And Emission Characteristics Of Dieselbiodiesel-Ethanol Blends In A Heavy-Duty Compression,"the effects of anhydrous ethanol (e) and castor oil (r) mixed with diesel fuel (d), commercially containing 5% biodiesel by volume, were researched experimentally to evaluate the combustion process and specific fuel consumption in a compression ignition engine, supercharged, six cylinders. in total, three mixtures were used, varying the diesel content from 95% (d95) to 80% v/v (d85), obtaining the following compositions: d95b0e0, d85b6e9 and d80b6.5e13.5. the experimental tests were performed in stationary conditions (1000 and 1800 rpm), two values of effective torque (80, and 160n.m) and two conditions of intake air pressure (100 and 80 kpa). the results obtained show that the mixtures containing ethanol and biodiesel lead to an early start of combustion at 1000 rpm and a delay at the start of combustion at 1800 rpm. the increase in ethanol and biodiesel over commercial fuel does not have any influence on specific fuel consumption; however, the altitude effect generates an increase in specific fuel consumption up to 11% and 7% at 1000 rpm and 1800 rpm respectively. the specific emissions of nox, co and co2are increased with higher specific fuel consumption; in addition, the effect of simulated altitude allowed to verify that at higher altitudes there is a slight increase in sfc and ee of co and co2, together with a reduction in ee nox. at 2000 m of simulated altitude (apci = 80 kpa) the maximum increases of sfc, co and co2, with the mixture d80b6.5e13.5, were 5%, 122% and 18%, respectively. and the maximum reductions in nox ee were also obtained with the d80b6.5e13.5 mixture, reaching decreases of up to 6%.","diesel, ethanol, combustion","Specific fuel consumption, net rate of heat released, and exhaust gas emissions were analyzed in a 6-liter compression- ignition engine, operating at different simulated altitude conditions and using different blends of diesel, biodiesel, and ethanol. The commercial fuel is D95B5E0 and the alternative blends (D85B6E9 and D80B6.5E13.5) included volumetric percentages of up to 13.5% ethanol and, to a lesser extent, biodiesel. The specific fuel consumption of the engine is not affected by the use of ethanol and biodiesel, despite the lower calorific value of the alternative blends. The results of the net rate of heat released show that the mixtures D85B6E9 and D80B6.5E13.5 slightly advance the start of combustion by 1000 rpm, with less intensity of the pre-mixed combustion phase. The opposite effect could be noticed at 1800 rpm, where a small delay in the start of combustion may occur due to the lower cetane number of the alternative mixtures; in addition, there is a greater intensity of the pre-mixed combustion. The specific emissions of NOX, CO and CO2 increase with the higher sfc. The CO2 EE decrease with the increase of ethanol and biodiesel in the fuel, because the OH radical of the oxygenated component would lead to a higher production of H2O. At 1000 rpm, CO emissions are related to observed trends in CO2; however, at 1800 rpm, CO EEs are increased with increased use of ethanol and biodiesel.

122,Developing A Performance Measurement Framework  For Logistics Service Providers,"the purpose of this paper is to develop a framework for measuring the performance of logistics service providers (lsps). the logistics literature was explored, and a set of articles and key performance indicators (kpis) were derived. a network analysis of the identified articles was undertaken and revealed five performance themes. a conceptual framework was developed based on the systems model and was classified as input and output performance dimensions. the proposed conceptual framework was further validated with empirical data. the obtained data was analyzed using structural equation modeling. results showed that the input performance dimension had a strong and positive impact on the output performance dimension. the results indicated that lsps were concerned on their service quality in terms of delivery in-full and on-time, and their cash conversion cycle. the framework contributes to the lsp’s performance measurement literature by proposing and empirically validating a performance measurement framework that is considered to be more comprehensive and suitable for the use in the lsp context. given this framework, lsps should be able to not only evaluate and monitor their day- to-day operations but also develop strategic policy and action plans that may be used to improve and enhance their competitiveness in a competitive environment.",,,"paitoon varadejsatitwong thammasat business school, thammasat university, bangkok, thailand paitoon-var58@tbs.tu.ac.th ruth banomyong dean, thammasat business school, thammasat university, bangkok, thailand ruth@tbs.tu.ac.th puthipong julagasigorn thammasat business school, thammasat university, bangkok, thailand puthipong-jul58@tbs.tu.ac.th",
123,Methodology To Assess Sustainable Mobility In Latam  Cities,"as the first step toward implementing strategies to improve mobility in urban centers, governmental authorities must assess their present situation in order to identify the most effective actions that should be included in their short and long-term plans. however, there is not a well-established methodology to carry out such an assessment. the already existing ones are subjective, incomplete, costly, and hard to implement, especially for the case of latin american countries. this paper proposes a comprehensive methodology to carry out this assessment. it uses recent advances in information technologies and includes the use of web map services, telematics data, and low-cost vehicle emission tests. the main purpose of the proposed methodology is to facilitate the identification of adequate strategies to improve sustainable urban mobility in a city of interest. this methodology is based on fraunhofer-morgenstadt city lab methodology and results on urban mobility obtained by the city lab team composed by the university of stuttgart iat, fraunhofer institute for industrial engineering iao, tecnológico de monterrey, and the municipal planning institute implan saltillo in the city of saltillo, mexico. the methodology was designed to allow the participation of third parties that could not be well informed on the local particularities of the city. therefore, this methodology includes the documentation of the current situation of the city on the many aspects connected to the mobility of the city. thus, the proposed methodology is divided into three phases: i) describing the region of study, ii) obtaining local data to evaluate a proposed set of key performance indicators (kpis), and iii) performing a mobility assessment based on a benchmarking evaluation of the kpis with comparable and/or reference cities. as an example of application, a mobility assessment was carried out for saltillo, a medium-sized city in northeastern mexico, which is considered a typical city in latin american countries. results indicate that this methodology can be replicated at a low incremental cost and that it leads towards the identification of the most sustainable (economic, environmental, and social) actions that should be implemented in these cities considering their local circumstances. proceedings of the international conference on industrial engineering and operations management monterrey, mexico, november 3-5, 2021 © ieom society international 1006",,,"josé i. huertas, oscar s. serrano, antonio e. mogro, and duván a. alvarado school of engineering and science tecnologico de monterrey monterrey, mexico jhuertas@tec.mx, a00829611@itesm.mx, a01366355@itesm.mx, duvanalvarado@usantotomas.edu.co sonja stöffler institute of human factors and technology management iat university of stuttgart stuttgart, germany sonja.stoeffler@iao.fraunhofer.de trinidad fernández fraunhofer institute for industrial engineering iao stuttgart, germany trinidad.fernandez@iao.fraunhofer.de xanin garcía and roberto castañeda instituto municipal de planeación saltillo-implan saltillo, méxico xgarcia@implansaltillo.mx, rcastaneda@implansaltillo.mx",
124,Measurement Of The Adaptability Of Practical Learning  Units To The Non-School Modality,"more than a year after the changes established in higher education in mexico in terms of the way of teaching and learning, which arise from the spread of the covid-19 virus throughout the world, it is necessary to evaluate students and teachers on their adaptation to change, to monitor their ability to adapt to the challenges presented by the non- school modality. in this case, for the practical subjects of the design and manufacturing branch of the specialty area of the industrial engineering administrator educational program, since some of these require a physical space and student-facilitator interaction, for example, man-machine and man-tool. a measurement instrument was designed which allowed us to know the level of adaptability of students and teachers in the practical learning units, results were obtained indicating the main challenges of both interest groups, analyzing the results, proposing recommendations and suggestions to improve the teaching, and learning process. the results are presented while the return to face-to- face classes is normalized. considering that people's health and well-being is the most important thing, the use of interactive software was proposed for these practical subjects, it could be the use of immersive videos, video games and / or augmented reality programs.","practical subjects, engineering, adaptability","After analyzing the results, we conclude that the online mode for hands-on learning units is complicated but not impossible. Various suggestions and proposals for improvement aimed at facilitating adaptation in the teaching- learning process of university teachers and students for better academic development are also considered, always ensuring the health and well-being of all during this pandemic. For example, in some practical matters a type of software, a program augmented reality, video games, among others, in order to meet the challenge of not performing physical practices that incurs the art could be used, whether the Immersive case Videos as in the case of matter Machines and Tools, where you work with lathe spindle, saw, etc., and fundamental part is the use of the 5 senses to better understand the use of these objects. It will always be a challenge to face what is not contemplated, in this case it was the COVID-19 pandemic. The fact that students and teachers prefer face-to-face classes and that both have gone through a process to adapt to this unexpected change could be considered as the common denominator between both groups. But also, the fact that they all demonstrate the ability to innovate themselves by not allowing themselves to be defeated by the adversities that occur in the non-presential modality, in this case, in the branch of Engineering. Despite the little or low interaction, it has been possible to specify the teaching of these practical subjects without the need to risk health, the entire class being online. Finally, readers are encouraged to continue acquiring knowledge of emerging technologies and to develop interpersonal skills, which have been rare and necessary throughout this pandemic. Without the certainty, it is visualized that the non-face-to-face modality will be implemented in the future of higher education. With all this, we are confident that humans will continue to adapt to the coming changes that occur in a new educational normally.

139,New Developments On The Geometry Of The Traveling  Salesperson Problem,"this work introduces a new mathematical interpretation of the solution space for the traveling salesperson problem (tsp); which is a combinatorial optimization problem that has applications in many fields, from logistics and manufacturing to design and configuration of products. the proposed interpretation shows that all solutions are contained on the edge of a sliced a spheroid. thus, modeling the solution space from a novel perspective. the contribution of this paper is fourfold: first the development of a linear programming problem which objective function value leads to an upper bound on the euclidean distance from a current feasible tsp solution to the optimal one; second, if the current feasible solution is optimal the solution of the later model will provide information that might aid in a further effort of confirmation; third once the bound on the distance is found the computer effort to achieve tsp optimally is realized; and finally a set of heuristics which are highly suitable for parallel graphical processing unit (gpu) computing are proposed. numerical experimentation shows that the heuristics and the gpu implementation can efficiently find solutions with an average of 3.5% of the lower bound solutions for symmetric tsp, and an average of 4.15% for asymmetric best known benchmark solutions. in addition, the computer effort to achieve optimality is also shown for these instances.","heuristics, spheroid",,"federico trigos egade business school tecnologico de monterrey san pedro garza garcía, nl 66269, mexico ftrigos@tec.mx javier gonzalez-sanchez school of computing, informatics, and decision systems engineering arizona state university tempe, az 85281, usa javiergs@asu.edu adrian ramirez-nafarrate facultad de ciencias economicas y empresariales universidad panamericana zapopan, jal 45010, mexico aramirezn@up.edu.mx",

144,Measuring The Risk Level Of Employees For Covid-19: A  Case In Government Sector,"the rise of covid-19 changed the way how people work. some are permitted to work from home, however, some workers are still required to always report. this increases the risk for covid-19 infection. this study measures the risk level of employees for covid-19 infection of workers in the government sector of the philippines. the rika assessment tool was utilized to evaluate the different risk factors associated with the covid-19 infection. based on the results of the study, the researchers can conclude that the comparisons with a low significant relationship are the total risk score and comorbidities, total risk score and smoking habit, total risk score and anxiety, as well as the lockdown and compliance. for the comparisons with a moderately significant relationship are the age and comorbidities, total risk score and hand washing, total risk score and sanitizing, anxiety and government trust, total risk score and government trust, total risk score and residential, as well as the total risk score and lockdown. the comparisons with a highly significant relationship are the total risk score and travel history, as well as the total risk score and compliance.","covid-19, risk level, illness, and mortality","In a comparison of the different chosen variables highlighted under Table 4. of the correlation analysis, the comparisons with a low significant relationship are the Total Risk Score and Comorbidities, Total Risk Score and Smoking Habit, Total Risk Score and Anxiety, and the Lockdown and Compliance. The reason why this is the case for the total risk score and comorbidities is that almost half of the respondents are in the lower risk areas of the scoring for the comorbidities factor under the health risk. For the total score and smoking habit, a large majority of the respondents do not smoke which therefore doesn't affect the total risk score under the health risk. For the total risk score and anxiety, based on the answers of the responses, a majority are very much anxious about the situation but because of that, they are more aware of the protection procedures that they need to perform and thus knowing how to keep safe. Also, this can be because there are more pressing matters or options that the respondents feel are more important than the anxiety factor thus there is a low significant relationship.

145,A Risk Level Assessment Of Food Delivery Riders For  Covid-19,"the primary objective of this study is to measure the risk levels of food delivery riders for covid-19 infection by looking into the health risk, behavioral risk, exposure risk, and social policy risk. the participants for the study were 30 food delivery riders from the philippines, and the rika assessment tool was utilized. for the statistical treatment of data, the researchers used descriptive statistics for the demographic profiling and correlation analysis for determining the significant relationship between different factors incorporated in the study. in the findings, for the health risks, the risk scale is low in age and comorbidities but high in gender and smoking habit. for the behavioral risks, there is low risk in handwashing, sanitation, social distancing, and trust in government, but the high risk in the use of face masks and anxiety. for exposure risks, there is low risk in residential type and travel history but a high risk in occupation. for social policy risk, the risk scale is low in the effectiveness of lockdown but is high in community compliance. in the correlation, it was established that there is a high correlation between total risk score and sanitizing. there were also moderate correlations between several pairs such as age and face mask, total risk score and age, total risk score and government trust, total risk score and residential, total risk score and travel history, and total risk score and lockdown. other relationships either had minor or no correlation.","covid-19, risk assessment","As conclusions of this study, the researchers were able to do demographic profiling for the respondents in which the profile of the respondents was identified. It showed that more than half of the respondents were 21-30 years old. 90% of the respondents also were profiled as them having no comorbidities. The behavioral risks in risk assessment were also computed. Such findings say that more than half of the population of respondents use medical face masks in their delivery transactions. The majority of them very frequently wash their hands, sanitation before touching their face was observed by the majority, following social distancing was also done by the majority. More than half of the respondents say that they are experiencing anxiety because of the current situation due to the pandemic, and an almost equal distribution (yes, no, maybe) is observed when it comes to trusting the government measurements. In assessing the risk levels of the respondents gathered, 50% have a minimal risk level meanwhile the other 50% have a moderate risk level. This is because most of the respondents were young and did not have any comorbidities. Hence, for the health risks, the risk scale is low in age and comorbidities but high in gender and smoking habit. For the behavioral risks, there is low risk in handwashing, sanitation, social distancing, and trust in government, but the high risk in the use of face masks and anxiety. For exposure risks, there is low risk in residential type and travel history but a high risk in occupation. For social policy risk, the risk scale is low in the effectiveness of lockdown but is high in community compliance. Looking at the study in finer detail, the researchers also determined correlational relationships between factors that were important. In ranking the factors which got high correlation results, the Total Risk Score and sanitizing came first. Some factors had moderate correlations. Namely, Age and Face Mask, Total Risk Score and Age, Total risk Score and Government Trust, Total Risk Score and Residential, Total Risk Score and Travel History, and Total Risk Score and Lockdown. Other relationships either had minor correlation or no correlation at all. In conclusion, the data calculated from the statistical analysis can be used as a model in measuring the risk levels of food delivery riders for COVID-19 infections. The health, behavioral, exposure, and social policy risks are described by the different findings and therefore can be used in examining the food delivery platform during the COVID-19 pandemic. 6. Recommendation The authors of this study suggest management from the food delivery companies mentioned above that they use this model or perhaps improve this in their perspective to determine safety standards for their delivery personnel. The authors of this study also recommend that a long time would be required in gathering the data for this study to have more accurate findings. It has been a limitation that only 30 respondents were gathered in concluding the given data. For future research, it is recommended that being able to provide a greater number of respondents would give a better and accurate statistical result that can be used.","lorenzo t. caday, krisanta ana e. draculan, kianna denise c. villapando, ma. janice j. gumasing school of industrial engineering and engineering management mapua university muralla st., intramuros, manila, 1002 ltcaday@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, kaedraculan@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, kdcvillapando@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, mjjgumasing@mapua.edu.ph",
146,Time Duration Of A Driving Cycle And Its Representativeness,"there is an interest in representing properly the driving patterns, energy consumption and vehicle emissions of a region. driving pattern is understood as the way that people drive their vehicles. one of the ways to represent the driving patterns is through time series of speed, denominated driving cycles (dc). the duration of the dc is an important factor to define a dc. short dcs tend to generate high fuel consumption and emissions results due to the vehicle operates primarily in its warm-up phase. long dcs represent higher costs in the type approval tests. the time duration of each dc is unique since it represents local and particular operating conditions. however, there is no defined methodology to establish the duration of dcs based on the driving characteristics of a specific region. this study aims to study the effect of different time durations of the dcs on their representativeness. we used data of speed, time, fuel consumption and emissions of travels monitored for two months from a fleet of 15 buses operating in a flat and high traffic region. using micro-trips method, we built dcs with a time length of 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 45, 60 and 120 minutes. the results indicate that for having dcs with relative difference equal or less than 10% respect to the driving patterns, the dcs must have a duration of more than 25 minutes. this time length also guarantees the representativeness, in terms of energy consumption and tailpipe emissions.",driving patterns,,"michael giraldo mechanical engineering department universidad eafit medellin, colombia mgiral36@eafit.edu.co luis f. quirama and juan e. tibaquirá mechanical engineering department universidad tecnológica de pereira pereira, colombia luisfelipequirama@utp.edu.co, juantiba@utp.edu.co josé i. huertas mechanical engineering department tecnológico de monterrey monterrey, méxico jhuertas@tec.mx",

148,Order Picking Improvement Through Storage Assignment  Optimization And Human Error Identification: A Case Study,"this study presents the application of storage assignment and human error improvement model in warehouse management to the case study of automobile seat manufacturers. the objectives are to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the order picking (op) process in companies. for improving the efficiency of the op process, capacity decision analysis and an optimization method using linear programming are used to perform storage assignments of raw material in the warehouse. the human error improvement model is then used as an approach to reduce human error that occurs in the op process and increase its accuracy. three scenarios of storage assignment are analyzed, and all of them results in a better total op time compared to the existing condition. several recommendations of improvement actions are also provided to reduce the occurrence of human error in op process. the contribution of this work is two folds; it provides a practical contribution to the case study, and it helps to enrich the literature related to the op improvement strategy.","order picking, storage assignment, optimization","There are 3 comparison scenarios carried out on the implementation of the storage assignment optimization model. The first scenario is the existing condition of the placement of raw material items in the observed company, where the placement of raw material items follows the latest conditions in the warehouse. The total OP time obtained is then the product of the displacement frequency, the number of trolleys, and the time per pick for each position of the raw material item. The three scenarios of storage assignment results in the total OP time for one month in scenario 1, scenario 2, and scenario 3 is 417.9 hours, 288.6 hours, and 255.5 hours respectively. In the human error improvement model, the output of phase 2 will identify the improvement actions that are possible to be taken by the company to reduce human error. The three improvements that have the most significant impact in reducing human error based on the Pareto analysis are actions are conducting spreadsheet training for data recording purposes, implementing a FIFO card system with different shelf lines for new goods and old goods, and making a large map of the placement of goods after the addition of capacity.

150,An Integrated And Comprehensive Tool To Assess Urban  Mobility Strategies,"transport planning is a challenging topic to be addressed in urban areas in order to create sustainable cities, due to the adverse health effects, noise and congestions generated by the transport sector. therefore, policymakers require technical tools that allow to take regulatory transport decisions, considering environmental and health impacts. this work presents the development of an integrated and comprehensive tool to assess urban mobility strategies called maitec. the methodology includes the implementation and application of specialized software to estimate health impact by transport emissions. the tool was implemented in a university district in mexico. results indicate that in the base scenario, people are exposed to high pollutant concentrations in some sectors of the district, where traffic pollution claims approximately 9 lives every two years. maitec was implemented in a free online platform and shared with local governments for its application.","health impact, air pollution, campus monterrey",,"jose i. huertas and maria e. huertas school of engineering and science tecnologico de monterrey av. garza sada 2501, mexico jhuertas@tec.mx, maria.huertas@tec.mx",
151,"Factors Of The E-Commerce That Are Directly Related To The  Consumer'S Purchase Motivation In Nuevo León, Mexico.","e-commerce is revolutionizing the way we buy and interact with brands, with advantages in saving time, access to exclusive promotions and automatic payments. for their part, companies have an alternative to achieve greater user loyalty. smes and large companies are offering their products and services through these platforms, allowing business development in increasingly globalized environments. with an increasingly strong presence of the internet in everyday life and the security that the banking sector has generated for conducting electronic transactions, people see e- commerce as the perfect option for convenience and time savings.","e-commerce, advertising","According to the observed results, the proposed Model 4 with a 𝑅𝑅2 of 0.593, as seen in Table 5, the variable that has the greatest weight in terms of its beta, in the explanation of the purchase intention is the Discounts and promotions. The results are in line with previous research findings that demonstrate the positive effect of sales promotions on consumer behavior (Alvarez & Casielles, 2005; Gupta, 1988) as well as strengthens the theoretical assumptions that the sales promotion is an important element to influence purchasing behavior of a customer (Blattberg & Neslin, 1990). Second, it is the Online store design. Third, it is the delivery time, from when the purchase was generated, until the delivery of this. Finally, it is the Perceived confidence by the consumer towards the e-commerce platform. Equation (1) represents the model of multiple linear regression obtained in this investigation. 𝐲𝐲ො= 𝟎𝟎. 𝟓𝟓𝟓𝟓𝟓𝟓+ 𝟎𝟎. 𝟏𝟏𝟏𝟏𝟏𝟏𝟏𝟏𝟏𝟏+ 𝟎𝟎. 𝟐𝟐𝟐𝟐𝟐𝟐𝟐𝟐𝟐𝟐+ 𝟎𝟎. 𝟐𝟐𝟐𝟐𝟐𝟐𝟐𝟐𝟐𝟐+ 𝟎𝟎. 𝟑𝟑𝟑𝟑𝟑𝟑𝟑𝟑𝟑𝟑+ 𝛜𝛜 (1) This research recommends, as we verified statistically, that e-commerce platforms should focus in the investments of agile, feasible processes and pay attention to promotional events, payment facilities; as well as a fast, secure and traceable shipment. These factors can be of great help to increase your sales and income. One drawback of this study is that we have only used online store design factors as antecedents of trust. Jarvenpaa and Tractinsky (1999) had conceptualised that there are other factors such as vendor repute and vendor size that affect purchase intention. Tan et al. (2007) had shown empirically that external and internal norms affect purchase intention. For future research the exploration of in depth online store design will provide more data on how to make an attractive and more user friendly platform to increase the online purchase intention to increase online sales. Also an important research to be made in the near future is to expand this study to different consumer cultures, other demographics to compare and get more knowledge on this topic.","valentín lara-jiménez , carolina solís-peña uanl school of chemical sciences universidad autónoma de nuevo león san nicolás de los garza, nl 66451, méxico vlaraj@uanl.edu.mx, carolina.solispa@uanl.edu.mx federico g. figueroa-garza & abel partida-puente uanl school of business universidad autónoma de nuevo león san nicolás de los garza, nl 66451, méxico federico.figueroagrz@uanl.edu.mx, abel.partidapnt@uanl.edu.mx",
152,Determination Of Factors For Sustainability In Resilient  Supply Chain In The Automotive Component Manufacture,"the supply chain involves all the processes from the purchase order request to the delivery to the final customer, however, there are factors such as the health crisis that make organizations vulnerable if they do not take full advantage of their resources. also, these changes cause the world to think seriously about the sustainability of manufacturing and services considering the characteristic of resilience which is the ability to overcome difficult circumstances and reverse logistics, which is related to strategic planning. however, they are also considered strategies that allow companies to jointly face market volatility and changes in demand without affecting the organization's economic barriers.","resiliency, reverse logistics, supply chain","The pandemic (COVID-19) has shown that Supply Chains are exposed to be affected if they do not have a plan to react to the effects coming from the external market. In this study, a literature analysis was carried out in which the variables that according to the literature have an impact on the formation of resilient supply chains in other parts of the world were considered, as could be observed in the theoretical framework. The variables considered were the following: reverse logistics, economic barriers, supply chain strategies, collaboration between supply chain participants, and finally, data available for decision making. The study was applied to the automotive industry, as it contributes a large percentage of the country's exports and imports. The measurement instrument used was a survey containing items for the evaluation of the independent and dependent variables, the result of the application of this yielded two models, considering that the one with the greatest impact is the second one with an R2 of .857, which indicates that this model represents 85.7 the research problem. Regarding the statistical results of the independent variables of this research problem, the independent variables that were found to be significant are the economic barriers, as well as the strategies focused on the supply chain with betas of .478 and. 307 respectively; these results indicate that the organizations in this line of business in the state of Nuevo Leon consider that to be resilient they should focus their actions on having a supply chain strategy; the organizations consider that the actions taken by governments directly affect their processes, and mention that in this area they have no control; in the case of supply chain strategies, the questions that had high results were planning in the selection of suppliers, planning objectives and having a strategy focused on risk management. The results of this research indicate that the organizations in the study do not consider reverse logistics, supply chain collaboration and data analytics to have an impact on the formation of resilient supply chains. Despite this, it is recommended that the non-significant variables be explored further in future and larger scale studies. It is worth noting that this research proposes that organizations focus their supply chain strategies on exploring the risks they are exposed to considering their geographical location and the relationship of the consequences of having suppliers or their customers in other locations where there are borders between countries.","industry. carolina solís peña, valentín lara jiménez, juan manuel hernández ramos & mónica blanco jiménez. industrial engineering administration university of nuevo leon san nicolás de los garza, nuevo león, 66460, méxico carolina.solispa@uanl.edu.mx, vlaraj@uanl.edu.mx, juan.hernandezr@uanl.edu.mx, monica.blancojm@uanl.edu.mx",
153,Quality 4.0: Entity Relationship Model For Inspection And  Repair Processes In Aerospace Domain,"for decades, data-driven decisions have become the core of quality improvements. a new paradigm has been introduced for the digitalization of quality management with “quality 4.0”. automatic data and information exchange are the essential steps of the quality 4.0 paradigm to achieve automation of the manufacturing systems. the goal of this paper is to design and manage the database of the automated system as the first stage of data preparation for quality management. for this stage, we use the entity relationship (er) modeling technique to develop conceptual and logical models. this technique is used in a real case study to organize and manage the database of inspection and repair processes in aerospace manufacturing. the real merit of the developed models is to create a well-structured database that describes the system’s data flow with high data quality.","quality 4.0, data modeling","Quality 4.0 anticipates the digital transformation of quality management will improve the process and/or product quality and will increase productivity. Data automation supports the vision by monitoring the processes and collecting the necessary information. When the data management process is improved, it will be possible to identify the process variables that are required to be monitored by quality tools, for example, the control chart. ER modeling technique is widely used to design a data model that represents the data of the system in entity sets and describes their relationships. Moreover, it provides the key performance indices for quality to detect any anomalies during system operation. In this paper, we developed the conceptual and logical ER models for the SARA system which is an automated inspection and repair in the aerospace maintenance and repair domain. These models aim to organize the data in the system by identification of nine entities that represent the process, and their relationships with each other and their attributes. They characterize and control the information generated by the SARA system. Consequently, the data flow along the SARA model is visually represented and easily understood. The models favor accessibility, traceability, and reproducibility for better communication between inspectors and design specialists and tracking relevant information. For future works, we will convert the logical ER model for the SARA system to a physical model that is implemented in the system. The physical data model represents the actual database design according to what is carried out in the logical one. The physical model defines the data types; numeric, string, date, or time, etc.; the foreign keys that link the entities, and the necessary constraints. It is used to support the implementation of the database using DBMS software. It provides a Data Definition Language (DDL) file, which is generated by MySQL Workbench software that will be implemented in the SARA system. Consequently, the automation of inspection and repair in the SARA system allows to enter the data that are defined in the model automatically, and provides the information that each stakeholder is interested in. After data preparation, we are targeting the implementation of the Quality 4.0 aspects. By providing the key performance indices for quality of inspection and repair actions, the information’s variability of inspection and repair processes will be monitored by quality monitoring control tools based on machine learning and statistical control chart. This tool assesses the quality of the repair process based on the confirmation rate of the repaired parts to be within pre-specified limits. When the repair quality gets beyond these limits, the tool does not only detect abnormal behavior in the process but also, it determines the root cause of that out-of-control process. Then, corrective actions are taken to avoid several reworks of repair and maintain the repair process within the quality control limits. Acknowledgment This research is supported Consortium for Research and Innovation in Aerospace in Québec (CRIAQ), funded by Mitacs accelerate program (Grant No.: IT11797).

157,Smart Warning System For The Rotating Parts Based On  Cloud Computing,"new smart warning system (sws) that use to send a warning level report about the machine components failure behavior via distance is proposed in this article. the data were collected from the experimental setup to enhance the maintenance strategies. the new warning system uses the collected data to build a probability hazard model (phm) that computes the warning level to give the decision- making team the advice about component replacement. the proposed system uses cloud computing technology to connect between the physical world and the remote main hub of sws which receives the monitored signal to compute the warning level and warning level of the machine element. in this article, a novel sws is built to reach the near-zero breaks down. also, the system sends a warning alarm through e-mail to the decision-making team to follow the failure behavior of the monitored parts. in this article, the run to failure data of 8 identical belts is collected from an experimental setup that simulates the operation condition in the real factory. the proposed system gives the industrial processes the time to complete the required tasks with near- zero breaks down. this paper presents a simulation of a new smart monitoring system by using a new methodology in the context of industry 4.0. section building the sws illustrates the schematics of the proposed system. finally, current and future smart monitoring systems in industry 4.0 are discussed.","cps, mexico","In this paper, a novel smart warning system is proposed to achieve near-zero breaks down. The proposed system computes the failure probability of the machine part. This work transforms the traditional machine to the I 4.0 age. Our system is based on using the run to failure data of the machine part to build the PHM which is used to predicate the warning level of the part. The warning level calculation saves the machine from running without sudden breaks down. The wide use of belt drive pushes us to use the proposed methodology to find its governed equation that explains the behavior of its failure model. The proposed methodology is applied on the v-belt drive in G.U.N.T. machinery diagnostic system (PT 500). The study starts with the collect accelerated run to failure of eight belts. After that, we collect the time to failure data used to build the Cox model as shown in the modeling developing section. After that, we use the generated PHM to build the Smart warning system which consists of three layers as shown in the Smart warning system. The proposed SWS simulation is illustrated in the building SWS section. Figure (7) illustrate an example for the SWS results. The SWS gives the operating team a clear view about the failure behavior of the rotating machine parts. Also, the limitation of the proposed system is illustrated. For future research, we work on enhancing the proposed methodology to work with controllable variables such as rotating speed and tension force. Also, the applying of multi-machine parts monitoring is the future of the proposed methodology. Also, build a prototype of the proposed system will be our task to deal with the real-time complications.","amr mohamed ali department of mechanical design engineering faculty of engineering helwan university cairo, egypt amr_abduljawad@m-eng.helwan.edu.eg, soumaya yacout department of mathematic and industrial engineering école polytechnique, montréal québec, canada soumaya.yacout@polymtl.ca el-adl rabeih department of mechanical design engineering faculty of engineering helwan university cairo, egypt eladlmr@m-eng.helwan.edu.eg yasser shaban department of mechanical design engineering faculty of engineering helwan university cairo, egypt yasser.shabaan@polymtl.ca",
158,Bond Graphs For Manufacturing Control: Model’S  Improvement,"industry 4.0 paradigm calls for responsive scheduling and production control systems. feedback loops incorporated to these systems allow decision making updates based on the real-time shop floor state. the bond graph approach enables the simulation of production control with feedback loops, but previous research with this theme is scarce. in the existing models, the buffers are modeled with infinite capacity, causing the effort variable to become zero and introducing a non-linear function that cramps the design of controllers. we propose modifications to an existing model in order to overcome this limitation, and simulate a 4-station shop floor as a proof of concept. with an optimal control approach, the rate of the material sources could be adjusted to keep the work in process at desired levels. the approach contributes to the literature with a model with more realistic assumption (limited buffers) and with the design of responsive production systems, addressing a research thread that is relevant to recent digitization trends.","bond graphs, dynamic modeling, production control","In this paper, we modify an existing bond graph model of shop floor dynamics by defining buffers with limited capacity and by eliminating the source of effort that coupled buffer and machine. As advantages, the proposed model supports a more realistic assumption, relevant in practice, and respects the power transmission principle of the bond graph approach. The LQI controller implemented for WIP control was able to track the desired (non-zero) values for the buffers. This WIP control produces practical benefits, as already highlighted in the literature. The simulation of the model may provide directions to managers on how to respond to disturbances in the shop floor without an excessive cushion (since excessive WIP leads to long manufacturing times). The modularity of bond graphs allows modeling production systems with different configurations. There is a gap concerning closed-loop models for production control; the studies are even more scarce when bond graph models are considered. This study addresses this gap and contributes to the Industry 4.0 context with a model of a responsive shop floor. As future research, optimization approaches could be used to better define the parameters of the model (machine processing rates and buffer capacities). Also, Model Predictive Controllers (MPC) can be proposed using the canonical state-space model or nonlinear approaches can be implemented using the nonlinear model, which has not been explored in this work.

Existing data acquisition systems are based on licensed and cabled software, which are expensive and not easily accessible. They are either continuously connected to the network or manually controlled. Some wireless data acquisition systems exist, but they rely on license-based software and cloud services. There are very few wireless data acquisition systems using freely available software, which monitor and record fewer parameters at a very high cost. These problems can be eliminated using the proposed data acquisition system based on the Internet of Things (IoT). The proposed data acquisition system is based on open access software and cloud service. This paper presents a design of a cost-effective data acquisition system to collect operational data from the air quality monitoring system for evaluation purposes with ubiquitous access. The test results revealed that the suggested data acquisition system is appropriate, reliable, cost-effective, and suitable for harsh outdoor conditions for monitoring and collecting operational information of the system. This system used provides a more affordable method for sensing and monitoring systems in the field of domestic and industrial standards to upgrade the IoT. The following conclusions have been drawn. ● The proposed data acquisition system provides a cost-effective method for sensing and monitoring air quality system for laboratory personnel. ● The proposed data acquisition system can be controlled (ON/OFF) by using the Wi-Fi enabled switch according to the requirement. In this way, we can not only save the lifetime of the sensors. 7.","case study nicolas ferreira mechatronics engineering department universidad del cono sur de las américas asunción, paraguay nferreira@ucsa.edu.py matias sanchez electronics engineering department universidad politécnica y artística del paraguay asunción, paraguay msanchez@alumno.upap.edu.py walter lópez industrial safety management petropar villa elisa, paraguay wlopez@petropar.com.py",
163,Processed Food Imports That Improve Company  Competitiveness In Emerging Countries,"company internationalization drives the search for competitive foreign suppliers. therefore, this study aims to determine the factors that boost processed food imports for large mexican food companies. we collected data through a 55-question survey applied to major large companies of northern mexico. the results of the multiple linear regression model show that international price, required quality, international availability of the product, knowledge of customs clearance procedures and company logistics capabilities explain 66.4% of import drivers. they also confirm that there exists a negative relationship in logistics capabilities. this study is unique in that it shows imports can provide a competitive strategy, using five key factors.","competitiveness, imports, processed foods","This explanatory framework emphasized the global economic importance of the processed food industry in Mexico and the State of Nuevo Leon, regarding production, consumption and imports and it also emphasized the importance of food safety. This industry is particularly important since companies strive to continuously improve the supply of processed food either domestically or internationally, mostly for two reasons. Firstly, they intend to keep production lines supplied in order to meet the market’s food demand. Secondly, they aim to achieve a competitive advantage through product differentiation. Using the theoretical analyses performed, we selected the factors considered to drive imports and the results show that the international price of the product, the required quality of the product, the international availability of the product, knowledge of customs clearance procedures and the company’s logistics capabilities explain the 66.4% variation in the drive to imports. Therefore, based on these findings that show the significant variables in accordance with the literature analyzed, in this section we propose strategies that will help Mexican large food companies increase their imports and become more competitive. In this sense, we will briefly discuss the results of each of the proposed variables or factors. First, the product international price has always been a key element in international purchasing, generally assessed along with other factors that help the entrepreneur make a purchase decision. In this regard, companies analyze the prices of those products that meet the requirements agreed with the foreign supplier from the start and enable them to have competitive prices in the domestic market. Thus, the company’s ability to negotiate the price in international trade transactions confers it another advantage related to imports. However, we should not forget the Dumping issue where several countries practice price discrimination by subsidies granted to particular industries, or companies that sell at less than normal value, engaging in unfair foreign trade practices regulated by Article 28 of the Foreign Trade Law (Laguna, C.E., 2002). Furthermore, the product required quality is a variable that allows companies to produce unique foods in order to compete in the marketplace. Companies report that they would import products at the required quality even if at a higher cost than those found in Mexico. Thus, importers that pursue strategies to enhance their competitiveness may consider importing as a means to purchase, produce and sell quality processed foods. Besides, providing quality products entails product differentiation, since these products may have a specific quality, and as they are products or raw materials sometimes only available abroad, these companies may manufacture products difficult for competitors to imitate. Thereby, they ensure that they will keep up with consumer preferences for longer. The information gathered from these 2 variables shows that companies should identify the strategy they will use to compete in the domestic or international marketplace, whether they will maintain their leadership position by low prices or by quality products, as this will determine the significance assigned to each factor upon making an import purchase decision. Another significant variable was the product international availability that respondents consider important since food companies use it as a resource to access new supply sources without disregarding the supplier’s commitment toward timely delivery of processed foods. A low level of product availability may impact on sales results, but a company that counts on a product almost exclusively available may monopolize the niche market and get ahead of the competition.Furthermore, respondents consider the knowledge of customs clearance procedures to be particularly relevant since experience is required to achieve more flexible food imports with less extra costs, as confirmed by Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management Monterrey, Mexico, November 3-5, 2021","monica blanco-jimenez angelica tejeda-villanueva diana m. vasquez-treviño maria de jesus araiza vazquez facultad de contaduría pública y administración, universidad autónoma de nuevo león, san nicolas de los garza, nuevo león, méxico monica.blancojm@unal.edu.mx","References

165,Making Monterrey An Example Of Sustainable Mobility  Based On Electric Bicycles,"the use of bicycles has increased 221% since march 2020, creating a positive outlook in the adoption of bicycles as a sustainable means of transportation. the use of bicycles represents a direct impact on environmental management. likewise, it is important to mention that the impact of the bicycle is conditioned to the physical capacity of the cyclist and the ability to provide the energetic effort required to reach the destination. therefore, technological developments have allowed the creation of different proposals of models that fit according to the needs of users presented above, creating a positive outlook in the introduction of electric bicycles within the framework of citizen mobility. two commercial electric bicycles, one with a front wheel and one with a rear wheel, were evaluated to compare the energy consumption in different static and dynamic conditions. the energy consumption was similar for all conditions except for the conditions where there was traffic and inclination, the bicycle with front wheel had the lowest energy consumption due to traction system. additionally, the design of a blcd type electric wheel-motor is proposed. it was found that the energy performance of the bicycle with the front wheel is 15% lower when developing circuits with traffic compared to bicycles with rear wheel. when comparing the bicycles in other circuits, no significant difference in energy performance was found. as further work remains to evaluate these same characteristics with the motor-wheel designed in this work.","electric bikes, blcd motors, tzytli escobar, erick garcía",,"josé ignacio huertas school of science and engineering tecnologico de monterrey monterrey, nl 64849, méxico jhuertas@tec.mx david mastrascusa school of science and engineering tecnologico de monterrey monterrey, nl 64849, méxico d.mastra@tec.mx",
166,Supporting Digital Transformation Using Business Process  Management: Proposal Of A Digital Tool,"growing demands for globalization, integration, consistency, innovation and efficiency alongside digital technological developments have drastically increase the interest in business processes. in this field, business process management (bpm) emerged as a tool to facilitate the standardization in digital transformation methods, as it helps to clarify new processes and, consequently, to propose technology-based solutions. in this paper, a conceptual framework on business process management that culminated in the development of a digital tool to support digital transformation in an industry-specific context is presented. the proposed solution contributed to an increase in processes’ standardization, monitoring and interconnection, making processes more efficient and with high levels of communication, performance and transparency.",bpmn,"This paper has presented a conceptual framework on business process management that culminated in the development and implementation of a digital tool to support the organization’s transition from a traditional to a digital mode of operation. The study focused on the problem caused by the vast amount of data stored in various documents without any specific organization or easy access. The proposed solution has the capacity of analyzing data and increases the amount of available information. It was developed in Power Apps, a low-code Microsoft software, and involved the use of other support software, such as SharePoint, Power BI and Outlook. The use of the UML notation was essential for the development of the system, helping to present the tool specification from different functional points of view. Complementing the UML notation with the BPMN notation, it was also possible to map different information flows, which contain the identification of the actors involved in the process, their responsibilities and, in certain cases, the different steps to be followed, which can serve to ensure the sustainability of the tool. During the development of the project, BPM was a critical tool since it facilitated the understanding of the system and, therefore, leveraged a successful digital transformation. There are several positive results arising from the implementation of this digital tool, among which the improvement of information management, which is now centralized and formally structured, the creation of new key performance indicators (KPIs) and the increase in employees’ satisfaction. The centralization of data that was previously recorded in different places and in different formats allowed to improve, not only access to information, but also its quality, the crossing of data and the speed of communication between different actors. Analyzing the consequences of the implementation of the information system in a broader scope, it is clear that the correct use of information systems is essential for an organization to remain competitive, efficient and in continuous improvement of its processes. As future work, it would be interesting to develop the application in a mobile phone format and to add new features with the aim of continuing to facilitate the access to and the understanding of quality and pertinent information by users.

167,"A New Model For Identifying, Capturing And Transmitting  Knowledge: A Proposal Based On Practical Experience","nowadays, markets are characterized by their complexity and unpredictability forcing organizations to adapt quickly to enhance their processes and achieve competitive advantage. to achieve these goals, the knowledge from each employee is fundamental because they know the process better than anyone. thus, convert individual knowledge into collective knowledge is considered a key strategic resource for organizations to obtain long-term sustainable advantage, making evident the importance of investment in knowledge management (km). although companies are increasingly able to compete based on their ability to effectively manage knowledge, there are still several challenges in this area, particularly in the ability to capture the knowledge present in the employee's minds (tacit knowledge) incorporating it into an effective and efficient management system that enables the retention and transmission of core knowledge in a long-term period. this paper presents the results of a practical experience in a multinational company implementing a km solution to identify, capture and transmit knowledge. based on the best experience practices and on the seci model developed by nonaka and takeuchi, a new model for identifying, capturing, and transmitting knowledge was developed and proposed. in general, the results indicate an improvement in the preparation of those responsible for conducting this type of work, an increase in the efficiency of knowledge capture and transmission, as well a positive involvement of employees in the organization's knowledge management culture. it is expected that these results can contribute as a tool to support other initiates in this area by organizations wishing to implement km initiatives.","tacit knowledge, explicit knowledge","and Future Work The success of KM in organizations involves sustaining initiatives and methodologies aligned with their objectives, being flexible to current and future needs, as well as subject periodic evaluations of the results obtained (Mohanjan, 2019). This paper suggests a new agile methodology for identifying, capturing, and transmitting knowledge that could be adapted to organization’s objectives through detailed methods and tools. From the methods proposed, we highlight the initial steps in the preparation of those responsible for this type of initiative, which are sometimes undervalued factors for the efficiency and quality of the final work. It should be noted that this preparation allowed to finish the capture phase 2 days before the initial plan. Furthermore, the identification and capture of knowledge based on 5 steps allow researchers to understand the big picture (macro processes) and, subsequently, to intensify efforts at the individual level (micro-processes) increasing the ability to identify and capture relevant knowledge. The conversion of tacit knowledge into knowledge that is easily understood by the target audience in words is one of the main challenges for any researcher in this type of KM initiative, given the complexity, individuality, and sometimes interculturality associated with this type of knowledge. With this study, it was concluded that the documentation by macro processes of the data, information, and knowledge captured with a simplified structure based on processes descriptions, objectives, and critical points optimize and speed up the task because the researcher focus centers on the most important: ""What is the Process?, What is it used for?; How it works? and What are the variables that influence its performance?”. Furthermore, the simplification of language and the use of short sentences and illustrative images/schemas are guidelines that contribute to the clarity desired in knowledge manuals/repositories. The model presented also contributes to mitigating some of KM barriers indicated in the literature, particularly with the possibility of encouraging the dissemination of KM culture as a “no extra load” for employees through diversified capture and validation plans, the possibility of reducing costs with travels to increase documents veracity and robustness, and the development of dynamic and interactive training based on the employee’s real needs. Finally, this paper highlights the possibility of adapting the SECI Model as a model for the creation and conversion of tacit and explicit knowledge in an industrial context different from the Japanese. However, to address some limitations to leverage future work it is relevant to mention that the model was implemented in an industrial context of an organization where the KM culture is present. So, in the future, it would be interesting to measure its impact in Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management Monterrey, Mexico, November 3-5, 2021","luís gomes department economics, management, industrial engineering and tourism (degeit) university of aveiro 3810-193, aveiro, portugal luismgomes@ua.pt leonor teixeira institute of electronics and informatics engineering of aveiro (ieeta), department of economics, management, industrial engineering and tourism (degeit) university of aveiro 3810-193, aveiro, portugal lteixeira@ua.pt","References

174,Comparison Of Behavioral Customer Segmentations For  Private Labels Using Clustering Algorithms,"an increasingly common practice among retailers is the creation of their own brands. the so-called private labels allow them to compete on price to attract new customers. the goal is to offer a quality similar to that of the traditional brands but at a lower price range. in this research, clustering algorithms based on machine learning techniques are applied to carry out a behavioral customer segmentation for private labels. the research has been completed in four stages: analysis, design, development, and discussion. during the analysis, 1.073 customer loyalty surveys are preprocessed and analyzed. during the design, 23 questions are selected to design experiments. the clustering algorithms used in the investigation are simple k-means algorithm (skma) and expectation-maximization clustering (emc). experimental results reveal clear differences in the performance of the selected algorithms. for example, when 4 clusters are predefined, skma distributes the instances according to the following proportions: 43%, 26%, 15%, and 15%. emc, instead, distributes the instances in 18%, 23%, 31%, and 29%. in conclusion, the results show that both algorithms, skma and emc, are effective and useful to segment customers based on their preferences. however, the peculiarities of their clustering strategies gives rise to significantly different clusters.",machine learning,"Different from demographic segmentation where differences between groups or clusters are evident, behavioral segmentation demands a more extensive analysis to characterize the difference between market segments. This investigation is based on an extensive supermarket customer survey carried out in Temuco (Chile) to establish a market segmentation using the well-known SKMA and EMC clustering algorithms. Clustering algorithms are widely used to identify pattern and classify unlabeled data by means of grouping similar data points in clusters that shares some degree of similarity. Both SKMA and EMC are iterative optimization methods to cluster data points. Depending on the needs and the number of iteration is possible to determine the optimal number of clusters. Although it might not be the most practical approach, especially when the number of clusters is too big. In this research the optimal number was found to be 12 clusters, from which only 4 concentrates mora than 10% of the data points. Instead of that, a fixed number of clusters, from K=2 to K=4, was analyzed. In the case of four clusters. While SKMA cluster sizes are 43%, 26%, 15%, and 15%., EMC cluster sizes are 218%, 23%, 31%, and 29%. An additional analysis was carried out to determine whether the question of each domain had an influence on the cluster scheme. The difference in the sizes of the resulting clusters confirms that the segmentation depends significantly on the nature of the questions taken into consideration. In conclusion, both clustering algorithms SKMA and EMC can help segmenting customers based on their behavior and preferences towards private labels. However, behavioral segmentation requires an additional work to characterize properly the found segments.","carlos hernández departamento de procesos industriales universidad católica de temuco temuco, chile carlos.hernandez.zavala@uct.cl magaly sandoval departamento de ingeniería industrial y sistemas universidad de la frontera temuco, chile magaly.sandoval@uforntera.cl",
175,Behavioral Segmentation For Supermarket Customers   Using Unsupervised Machine Learning Algorithms,"clustering is a machine learning technique to analyze data and to discover groups that share some similarities or closeness. it is useful for marketing segmentations because it allows classifying customers into groups based on certain characteristics. in literature, the most commonly studies segmentation types are: geographic, demographic, psychographic, behavioristic, volume, product-space, and benefit segmentation. this research is focused on behavioristic segmentations for supermarket chains. behavior patterns are the core of the behavioristic segmentation. it considers customers’ attitude toward brands, the knowledge of brands, purchasing habits and frequency. the segmentation related to loyalty is crucial to identify loyal customers and to focus marketing strategies and tactics. the revenue depends greatly on that segment. the research has been carried in four stages: analysis, design, development, and discussion. during the analysis, 1.073 customer loyalty surveys are preprocessed and analyzed. two algorithms are employed during the investigation: simple k-means algorithm (skma) and expectation-maximization clustering (emc). while skma cluster sizes are 27%, 15%, 15%, 26%, and 17%, emc cluster sizes are 2%, 29%, 24%, 32%, and 13%. in conclusion, both skma and emc help segmenting supermarket customers based on their behavior. however, behavioral segmentation requires a deeper analysis since the cluster boundaries are not evident.","customer loyalty, machine learning","Behavioral segmentation, different from other types, is not so evident and usually requires a deeper analysis to establish the difference between segments. This investigation takes advantage of an extensive supermarket customer survey to outline a segmentation based on the well-known SKMA and EMC clustering algorithms. Clustering algorithms are a special case type of machine learning algorithms used to classified unlabeled data by means of grouping data points having similarities or some degree of closeness with each other. Both SKMA and EMC are iterative optimization methods. Depending on the circumstances and necessities it might be possible to find the optimal number of clusters or define a given number that is more practical. Experiments revealed that the optimal number of clusters for the dataset is 16. However, only between 2 and 4 clusters concentrates more than 10% of the data points. A collection of small clusters or market segments might complicate excessively the design of an effective marketing campaign. Instead of that, a fixed number of clusters, from K=2 to K=5, was analyzed. In the case of five clusters, while SKMA cluster sizes are 27%, 15%, 15%, 26%, and 17%, EMC cluster sizes are 2%, 29%, 24%, 32%, and 13%. An additional analysis was carried out to determine whether the nature of the survey’s domain has an influence on the cluster definition. The difference in the sizes of the resulting clusters confirms that the segmentation depends, up to certain point, on the criteria being applied. In conclusion, both clustering algorithms SKMA and EMC can help segmenting supermarket customers based on their behavior.

177,Non-Homogeneous Poisson Process Modelling To Determine  The Reliability And Failure Cost Of Locomotives During The,"the south african railway industry is in the process of replacing its rolling stock fleet to keep up with technological advances. the paper presents the findings of reliability analysis, failure costs, and factors influencing the performance of the electric locomotives that run between kimberly and swartkops. secondary data for the study was gathered through field reports and financial reports. according to the findings, the fleet had an average reliability of 71%, and there was a direct correlation between the number of failures and the size of the fleet. the results show that the locomotives have a high number of failures in the early days of operation and that this number decreases over time. the accidents were identified as the main drivers of the maintenance cost, and the cost of quality accounted for 17% of the total cost of maintenance over 17 months. the environment where the locomotives were operating was identified to have the highest impact on fleet reliability. the research recommended improvements in the commissioning system to include the process to provide feedback to the production line. it is also recommended that the case study company should initiate regular inspections to identify damages due to environmental factors.","locomotives, failure cost, locomotives","The South African railway industry is in the process of replacing its rolling stock fleet to keep up with technological advances. According to the reviewed literature, very little is known about locomotive reliability and failure cost in South Africa during the warranty period. The following were the study's primary objectives: a) Model the reliability of locomotives operating between Kimberly and Swartkops during the warranty period using the Non-homogeneous Poisson Process; b) Determine the trends in locomotive failure cost during the warranty period; and c) Determine the causes of locomotive failures during the warranty period. The study used secondary data analysis as the research method. According to the findings, the locomotives had a high number of failures during their early days of operation, with an average of 71% reliability `monthly. The current research identified a mismatch between the 90-day maintenance cycle of the locomotives and the IQR 63 days. It was recommended that as more information becomes available, the organization's plans must be adjusted. Because of the environment in which the locomotives were operating, the research recommends that the locomotives' condition be assessed regularly. The research identified the poor cost of quality to be trending at 17% of the total costs of maintenance. The cost of incidents had the highest average of 43% of the total cost over 17 months. The planned maintenance activities had an average of 40% of the total cost. The financial result also shows the need for investment in prevention actions like training, testing and technology integration processes to combat the failure cost. The panto-graph related failures, loss of communications, collision, brake-related failures, no-operation and not starting were identified to be the most dominating failure modes. The cause and effect diagram provided the ability to assess the root cause of the top 20 failure modes responsible for 80% of the failures. The researchers found loose catenary wires, stuck AC/DC switches and overhead stabilizer arms to be the main causes of pantograph-related failures. Communication failure mode was mainly from radio malfunction and loose wires. The result shows that communication failures were due to quality issues. Hence, the research recommends the focus on communication systems to reduce the poor cost of quality. The study identifies roaming animals as the main cause of collision-related failure. The result shows that the environment where the locomotives were operating harmed the fleet performance. Brake mal-function was identified to be the leading cause of brake-related failures. No-operations was mainly due to operator behaviour. Defective contactors and power off were the main causes of not starting failure mode. Overall, the fleet performance was identified to be mainly affected by the environment where the fleet was operating, quality problems and human behaviour.","warranty phase: a study of the south african railway b.b.s. makhanya, h. nel and j. h.c pretorius faculty of engineering and built environment university of johannesburg johannesburg, gauteng, south africa bsm3174@yahoo.com, hannelien@uj.ac.za, jhcpretorius@uj.ac.za",

180,Optimization Of Oil Well Production Using Binary  Programming Method: Case Study Offshore Platform,"indonesia's oil production from year to year has decreased. the decline was because around 90% of the total oil production was produced from fields that were more than 30 years old, so a large investment was needed to contain the decline. the java sea block is one of the oldest major blocks supporting indonesia's oil and gas production with the production of 32,000 barel oil per day (bopd) of oil and 167 million metric standard cubic feet per day (mmscfd) of natural gas, which has been operating since 1971. zu flowstation is one of the production fields that has been operating since 1984 with a production of 2000 – 2300 bopd, has 24 artificial lift / electrical submersible pump (esp) wells with different characteristics. production results fluctuate every year. this is due to the age of the old wells so they are not able to produce more oil. this study aims to maximize production results on the operating system by adjusting the frequency of the variable speed drive (vsd) automatically. the approach used is the optimization with binary programming method. the results showed an increase in production from 24 wells by 356 bopd or 3.56%.","binary programming, optimization","The results of research conducted on optimization of production in oil wells resulted in several conclusions, among others, based on the developed binary programming model, it can determine the combination of optimization wells to obtain the most optimal production benefits from each well with predetermined limits. Parameter changes in oil wells greatly affect the amount of oil production on the combination of wells, because the decisions are most optimal and influenced by changes in these parameters. The results showed an increase in production from 24 wells by 356 BOPD or 3.56%.

181,Biodynamic Suspension Model In A Comfort-Oriented    Qov Control System,"special relevance is given to achieve passenger comfort in ground vehicles, and the suspension system is a key element involved in this objective. the contribution of this research is the modeling of a quarter vehicle as a 7-dof system composed of a 4-dof biodynamic model and a 3-dof one-quarter of vehicle (qov) suspension model. moreover, a skyhook control strategy is being developed with the purpose of improving passenger comfort. performance indices in the frequency domain are applied to validate comfort for the passenger and road holding. the theoretical work in this research is supported by simulation work, in which numerical values were taken from experimental work. the herein reported results hold importance for the advancement of suspension studies and set precedence for work on similar systems with other control strategies towards half and full vehicle suspensions.","biodynamic model, semi-active, skyhook, comfort-oriented","and Future Work A suspension model was obtained to study the vertical dynamics of a one-quarter vehicle. This model allows to analyze in more detail the vertical dynamics of different parts of the body of a seated passenger, the seat frame, and the chassis. The simulations allow to detect differences between the masses of the system and not perceptible dynamics are highlighted in a 2 or 3 DOF model. According to the degrees of freedom, using the 7-DOF model provides an advantage since it has more masses to study in more detail the effects of the road disturbances on: head, chest, stomach, and pelvis-legs. It is a model that represents more aspects of vertical dynamics, but that avoids the complexity of other models reported with up to 10 or more DOF. It was also demonstrated that the suspension model developed is control-oriented, stable, and that it allows to continue investigating ways to improve passenger comfort and vehicle stability. With the obtained results in the frequency and time domain, it can be observed that an active approach contributes to a better passenger comfort, in terms of the performance criteria, in comparison to the passive suspension. Finally, to improve the 7-DOF model, more studies with different disturbance signals such as random profiles, are contemplated to be studied. Comfort for the passenger and vehicle stability are also consider for future work via the application of another control approaches, e.g., Groundhook or Hybrid (Groundhook + Skyhook) approaches. Moreover, this study could be extended towards half and full vehicle, vertical dynamics.","abelardo rodriguez-moreno, e.a. sánchez-segoviano, l.a. santa cruz, and l.c. félix-herrán school of engineering and sciences tecnologico de monterrey hermosillo, son, 83000, mexico a01252632@itesm.mx, a01252472@itesm.mx, 01252753@itesm.mx, lcfelix@tec.mx jorge de-j. lozoya-santos school of engineering and sciences tecnologico de monterrey monterrey, nl, 64849, mexico jorge.lozoya@tec.mx juan c. tudón-martínez división de ingeniería y tecnología universidad de monterrey monterrey, nl, 66238, méxico juan.tudon@udem.edu",

183,Qualitative Assessment Of Bioaerosol And Improvement Of  Indoor Air Quality Of Grocery Store In Tuguegarao City,"grocery stores are primary establishments where people purchase food, supplies, and household items. most stores are open daily, and some even for 24 hours. customers enter rodamel grocery store in tuguegarao city, cagayan, during the operating hours to buy goods. to ensure public health safety, there is a need to measure/analyze the iaq of the rodamel grocery store and compare the gathered data to existing iaq standards. for three consecutive days, air quality monitoring devices were used to measure the ventilation, temperature, humidity, also the concentrations of co2, formaldehyde, and particulate matter such as pm2.5 and pm10. bioaerosol samples were also collected and grown using a process called growth culture analysis to qualitatively identify how much is inhaled depending on the grocery shopper’s exposure time. based on the results, only the temperature and the humidity did not meet the acceptable ranges from the standards, exceeding the maximum of 27˚c and 60 respectively. for the bioaerosol sampling, all the 18 samples show a relationship that the longer the shopper stays inside the grocery store, the more bioaerosol exposure is experienced. further recommendations are also given to the rodamel grocery store to address their indoor air issues.","indoor air quality, bioaerosol, particulate matter","Based on the findings and analysis of the researchers, most of the parameters passed the standards except for the temperature and the humidity within the establishment. The moisture in the grocery dramatically exceeds the maximum humidity level imposed by DOE, which is 60%. At the same time, even though the evening data shows that it is mainly on the top level of 27˚C, this study was conducted during colder months of the year. Therefore it would be expected that the temperature in the establishment would be higher during the summer seasons. As for the pollutants, all of them are within standard limits imposed by ASHRAE, and most of them are in the ""Good. The Air Quality Index"" of the AQI, except for CO2, falls into the ""Moderate Air Quality Index."" Most of the statistical parameter correlations conducted were expected except for the case of the CO2 since it was affected by the frequently opened doors of the establishment, and for the possibility of PM10 and PM2.5 because of the clothing of the occupants and the biological agents, they expel via desquamation or scratching of the skin.

It showed that a human produces enough energy that can sustain a pressure ranging from 40-50 kPa vacuum under an operating time of 10 minutes. Adjustments to the pump and vacuum sealing were made, leading to better pump milking time. Fine-tuning of the prototype helped in maintaining the sustained pressure measured at the system accumulator. Moreover, the addition of lubricant to parts in contact assured smooth flow of operation of the machine. Attaching the cluster through the sides of the animal was found to be the safest and most efficient way in milking the animal since it can easily access its four teats, wherein each cup of the cluster was fitted well. The materials utilized in this system were chosen for their availability, cost, and ease of manufacturing, making it cheaper than the commercial milking machine available in the market. It was also found out that factors such as environment, milk-let down, food, and routine of milking contribute to the amount of milk yielded by the animal.

185,Assessment Of Indoor Air Quality Of Modernized Jeepney In  Manila,"people are aware that outdoor air pollution is harmful to their health, but indoor air pollution can also cause serious health complications. this study aims to determine the indoor air quality of modernized jeepneys to identify the best solutions to eliminate harmful emissions and provide comfort and good health for the occupants. the researchers conducted an iaq assessment, including the following concentrations: carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, pm10, pm2.5, formaldehyde, temperature, and relative humidity. in addition, a correlation of the parameters with the number of passengers and the cycle of opening-closing of the door were identified. a survey was conducted to explain the sampling results further. based on the results, pm2.5 and pm10 were the only contaminants that appeared to be within the standards. temperature and carbon dioxide both have a relationship with the number of passengers. carbon dioxide and pm2.5 both have a relationship with the cycle of opening-closing of the door. the rest of the results and recommendations drawn based on these results are discussed in the latter part of this paper.",indoor air quality,"Based on the IAQ assessment, PM 2.5 and PM 10 were the indoor contaminants that appeared to be within the standards; the rest of the included parameters exceeded the guideline values. On the other hand, based on the statistical analysis, temperature and carbon dioxide have a significant relationship with passengers. Also, PM 2.5 and carbon dioxide have a substantial connection with the cycle of opening-closing doors. Results revealed that the temperature level inside the modernized jeepneys involved in the study is higher than the baseline range. It may have been due to high heat gain since it was mostly partly sunny throughout sampling, which subsequently causes higher ambient temperature compared to the temperature inside the modernized jeepney. The concentration of relative humidity in modernized jeepneys exceeded that standard range; when this happens, it may trigger unnecessary fungi and mold formation that can cause harmful damage on both humans and the car. The concentration of carbon dioxide in the modernized jeepney involved in this study is not acceptable based on the standard comfort value. This may have been affected by various factors such as air exchange outside the vehicle, ventilation mechanism of the vehicle, travel route took during each ride and the movement of the commuters inside the vehicle. The carbon monoxide concentration gathered during the assessment was beyond the standard values; this may have been affected by the number of hours spent by the jeepney on traveling. On the other hand, the concentrations of particulate matter 2.5 and particulate matter 10 are acceptable based on the standards. This may have been due to t6he controlled number of people inside the modernized jeepney and because the jeepney has a Euro IV engine. Lastly, it appears that the concentration of formaldehyde in the modernized jeepney involved in this study is also higher than the standard value. The formaldehyde concentrations are mainly due to the emissions coming from various interior materials found in the compartment, upholstery, ceiling, and other parts since formaldehyde is one of the components used in manufacturing these interior materials. 6. Recommendation To regulate the in-cabin temperature of the modernized jeepney, the researchers endorse an air-conditioning system with a more flexible capacity since a load of passengers tends to vary throughout the route trip. Based on the results, the modernized jeepney has a high concentration of carbon dioxide, so it may benefit from having high-efficiency particle air (HEPA) filters or air cleaners to improve the CO2 engagement inside the vehicle. The researchers suggest proper monitoring for any possible leakage in ducts and pipes; this may allow the gas from the exhaust to enter the vehicle if leakage occurs, and management of the modernized jeepney should also consider replacing air filters and regular, thorough cleaning to alleviate such undesirable results. The jeepney drivers should opt to close the door when traveling through polluted areas such as tunnels and congested zones. Through this, there will be an adequate control on the concentration of the PM2.5 and PM10 inside the modernized jeepney. To further improve and maintain this comfortable concentration of PM10, modernized jeepney regulators may consider upgrading the air filters installed in Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management Monterrey, Mexico, November 3-5, 2021","arch joseph v. ayala, bon kenoh r. fernando, john luis g. joven, john jerry b. soreta, engr. ricky d. umali school of mechanical and manufacturing engineering mapua university muralla st., intramuros, manila, philippines 1002 ajvayala@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, jlgjoven@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, jjbsoreta@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, rdumali@mymail.mapua.edu.ph ma. janice j. gumasing school of industrial engineering and engineering management mapua university muralla st., intramuros, manila, philippines 1002 mjjgumasing@mapua.edu.ph","References

186,Ergonomic Design Of Taho Cart With Shock Absorber  System,"taho is a delicacy made of fresh tofu commonly retailed in the philippines, where vendors are usually forced to empty their supply in a few hours as the quality of taho deteriorates due to uncontrolled heat transfer and vibration-produced during peddling. this study aims to construct a prototype that will minimize quality deterioration of taho as well as to provide ease in retailing of taho. carts are the usual vehicle for street vendors. consequently, the prototype is loosely based on the design of the carts readily available in the market with key improvements such as coil springs on the auxiliary wheel and the addition of polyethylene foam for heat insulation. the results show that the cart design appears to have small fluctuations of temperature than manual operation. in contrast, the vibration frequency seems to be minimal throughout the assessment. in contrast, the quality of taho in terms of physical appearance is comparatively similar to both strategies due to it being beyond the study's scope. the prototype exhibited comparatively better results than its manual counterpart, alleviating the payload from tension, which creates a higher tilt and movement readings in terms of frequency and acceleration while achieving temperature being preserved throughout the interior of the system.",ergonomic design,"The objective of the research is to design and fabricate a taho cart with key improvements such as a vibration damping system to reduce the vibrational effect to the product and a heat insulation system to reduce the effect of ambient temperature on the product as well as to improve the ergonomics and safety of the vendors. The researchers observed two parameters that were discussed in this study: temperature and vibration. Based on the prototype, the fabrication techniques were adequate in accommodating the payload and cruise through a usual route traveled by the vendor. The researchers adapted the widely-used cart design by street vendors, adding key improvements to accommodate the given parameters. Cost-effectiveness was also prioritized by utilizing the available aftermarket parts such as coil springs and the cart itself to alleviate the vibration-induced road conditions. Using a double-walled cylindrical aluminum container alongside polyethylene foam covering the whole interior of the cart, heat transfer due to ambient temperature changes was minimized. The data presented in this study is sufficient to assess the difference between manual-operated and cart-operated methods properly. Based on the data acquired, the manual-operated method produces higher fluctuating values than the cart-operated method. The accelerometer graphs show that the cart-operated method has minimal vibrational frequency mainly due to the added key improvements such as shock absorber. The temperature graphs show that the prototype cart achieved higher temperature readings which means that heat was preserved through an extended period while achieving lower values in terms of tilt and movement inside the system. The prototype exhibited comparatively better results than its manual counterpart, alleviating the payload from tension, which creates a higher tilt and movement readings in terms of frequency and acceleration while achieving temperature being preserved throughout the interior of the system.","jared elias g. baltazar, marwin c. bontes ii, john carl r. narvarte, gio justin v. reyes, jaime honra, phd. school of mechanical and manufacturing engineering mapua university muralla st., intramuros, manila, philippines 1002 jegbaltazar@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, mcbontes@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, jcrnarvarte@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, gjvreyes@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, jphonra@mapua.edu.ph ma. janice j. gumasing school of industrial engineering and engineering management mapua university muralla st., intramuros, manila, philippines 1002 mjjgumasing@mapua.edu.ph",
187,Applying Clustering Algorithm On Poverty Analysis In A  Community In The Philippines,"in addressing poverty, proper poverty alleviation programs must be identified. analyzing the multidimensional aspects of poverty will lead to data-driven decision making. this study aims to analyze poverty conditions in a community in the philippines using data mining and clustering algorithm. the model resulted in clusters described in this paper as stable, critical, and at-risk clusters. among the clusters, the critical cluster has the highest incidents of poor conditions. in the cluster analysis, poverty alleviation programs where the household clusters should be prioritized were suggested based on the poor conditions in each cluster. the clusters analysis is intended to provide insights for use in the community’s planning and program implementation.","data mining, machine learning, that is","Using clustering algorithm, poor living conditions of households in the community were analyzed and prioritization in implementing socio-economic programs in each household cluster was recommended in this study. Aside from income, key variables from the data were identified to address multidimensional aspects of poverty and develop comprehensive strategies for the community. Data mining and cluster analysis were used as a decision support tool to obtain data understanding and describe the profiles of the household clusters in the community in terms of the significant socio-economic indicators present in the data. To organize the complicated data relationships presented in census data, cluster analysis was used in this study. The households in the community were grouped into three (3) clusters described as the Stable Cluster, Critical Cluster, and At-Risk Cluster. Focus areas were identified based on the cluster profiles. These were used as basis in recommending programs that would address the most pressing poor living conditions in the clusters.","michelle p. repollo school of information technology mapua university manila, philippines michelleprepollo@gmail.com rex aurelius c. robielos school of industrial engineering and engineering management mapua university manila, philippines racrobielos@yahoo.com",
188,Strategies To Improve The Logistics Of A Covid-19   Screening Process Within A Lean Six Sigma Framework,"the covid-19 pandemic has changed the way the world operates, forcing nations to adopt new procedures to combat the spread of the coronavirus while concurrently maintaining economic activity. during the pandemic, several countries implemented systems and processes to screen travelers who legally entered their borders before allowing them to intermingle with the general population. the caribbean, which depends heavily on tourism, is no exception. while the primary goal of a screening process is to protect the local population from disease spread, a secondary goal should be to ensure traveler satisfaction in terms of timeliness, accuracy, agility, and cost-effectiveness of the logistics of the process. this paper primarily addresses the latter goal by proposing a multidisciplinary approach to improve the logistics of a covid-19 screening process in a small island state. the recommendations are based on the absence of key disciplinary areas and perceived skill gaps between the professional cadre and workforce, and the computer and digital literacy of the nation. a lean six sigma framework is used to demonstrate how a structured methodology can be applied to implement the potential solutions.","covid-19 pandemic, lean six sigma","This paper applied a multidisciplinary approach within a lean six sigma framework to show how an existing COVID19 screening process for arriving air passengers to a small island state could be improved. Ideally, these dimensions should be addressed from the outset under the direction of a capable project manager and a competent and highly experienced team representing each of the five disciplinary areas. However, the goal of this paper was not to change, but to improve, a current system that handles low volumes of incoming passengers. An experiential observational approach was used to gather the data for the study. This method has its own limitations as extraneous factors, which the researcher might be unaware of, could impact the data collected. While the study represents an actual experience, the reliability of the data needs to be further improved by extending the study to cover a longer period and a larger sample of passengers. Future research could, however, focus on studying the implementation of the recommended strategies to determine the impact on performance. Another opportunity is to re-engineer and optimize the processes by making appropriate tradeoffs between efficiency and effectiveness. In such a case, consideration could be given to use of automation and the redesign of spatial layouts and workflows to facilitate a faster flow of passengers and data.

192,Understanding The Business Considerations For Future  Model-Building In The Financial Industry,"various research areas use models to aid business decisions, but what is done less frequently is investigating and determining what business considerations should be used in building those models and why. therefore, this paper focuses on discussing considerations that can have a potential impact on the medium to long-term business decisions made in the financial industry, with specific regards to independent financial advisors (ifas) in south africa. preliminary considerations are identified from literature including interviews with industry experts, business and academic literature as well as regulatory requirements. the preliminary considerations are tested and validated by four financial services providers that differ in their business considerations. from the initial consideration, 11 primary and 8 secondary considerations were identified and discussed. secondary considerations were identified as part of future research opportunities on the topic that can be completed when more quantitative data-gathering is completed. this study provides new academic insights into the complexity of the financial industry and the opportunities it holds.",financial industry,"and Recommendations This research focused on discussing and evaluating what the current businesses environment for FSPs looks like in the South African financial industry in specific. What was found is that the considerations as identified from literature and previous studies do provide valuable feedback in understanding the business environment and why these considerations are applicable. It was also found that the initial considerations that were identified are applicable across different IFA businesses and that these considerations assist in understanding what needs to be accounted for in models for the financial industry related to the strategic decisions that are made related to the future of the FSP. This research works towards finding agreement and consensus between academia and the industry regarding what the primary considerations are that can be used in the future, to provide guidance to FSPs in South Africa and possibly towards understanding it on a global level, given the global push towards global financial regulatory standards (Ugeux, 2014). The study gained insight from past research, regulations, legislations, and business literature as well as current and future developments in the financial industry, which is deemed crucial as any future research on this topic will be heavily reliant on this foundational research. From section 1, the main objectives of the research were, providing an overview of considerations that could be extracted from existing literature, which was completed in section 2 as well as enhancing the list of considerations and their impact, via expert interviews with FSPs as completed in section 4. The primary considerations that were found was: • Number of IFAs • Number of representatives • Number of administrative staff • The average administrative staff salary • Monthly turnover • Focus area(s) provided • Total number of clients • Targeted client segmentation • The information system currently being used • Whether business continuity planning is internal or external to the organization • How long an FSP is planning on staying in the industry before selling the business The following were deemed as secondary considerations that can be useful in future research: • Percentage commission split for IFAs • Percentage commission split for representatives • Whether the compliance officer is internal or external to the organization • The adoption rate of technology of the FSP • How long the FSP has been in the industry • Daily available working hours • Focus area(s) that clients require • Average time that the focus area(s) require The primary considerations should aid in understanding the business environment of an FSP before moving to secondary considerations that can be used to extend future research into the topic of model building in the financial industry. The next phase in this research will be to use the feedback from the IEOM conference participants and perform an additional round of validation with the use of surveys, including more than 500 FSPs in South Africa as participants, ranging from size and focus area, to reach a point where there can be reasonable assurance that the most critical business considerations have been identified and agreed upon. Thus, academia, as well as a larger sample of participants, will validate the findings during a second data-gathering cycle, with multiple organizations that have preliminary agreed to assist in this process in distributing the survey to their relevant employees and/or members where applicable, such as the Financial Intermediaries Association (FIA), which is the most prominent voluntary associate in South Africa of its kind.

193,Targeted Key Indicators For Improving National Innovation  Performance,"innovation is becoming more and more a decisive engine of development and economic growth. it impacts the economy on different activity scales: (i) at the micro scale (internal business innovation, business creation), (ii) at the meso scales (development of new activities) and (iii) at the macro scales (employment and growth). aware of that, policy makers, all over the world, emphasize innovation as a key driver of prosperity and progress in their countries. the purpose of this study is to help identify features that can explain variations in the intensity of innovation between countries. to better understand national innovative capacities, this study proposes identifying distinct groups (or clusters) of countries using their innovation performances. so, available innovation data is used to classify countries with common characteristics into meaningful clusters. then, these clusters are analyzed and new information that explains the variation of innovation performance between countries is extracted. to this aim, data representing 121 countries and 49 indicators are investigated over a period of 5 years. unsupervised and supervised data analysis models are applied using the 2015-2019 gii data. this analysis allows the classification of countries and the clustering of those progressing in the same way in terms of innovation. therefore, 4 major clusters of countries are defined. another important outcome of this study is the identification of key innovation determinants, or key indicators, with superior effect on innovation outcomes. the analysis emphasizes distinctly the “university/industry research collaboration” and “information and communication technologies (ict) use” as the two most important indicators enhancing national innovation performances. four cases studies are also illustrated in this study representing the four innovation clusters, namely for the usa, morocco, china, and brazil. this study’s results can assist countries in planning their mid-term innovation strategies by providing: (i) a reduced number of relevant determinants to improve, and (ii) a focused set of prospective countries for potential benchmarking either intra- or inter-cluster.",,"The innovation system approach has proven useful in explaining the mechanisms behind varying national economic performance. By using GII data over the period 2015-2019, and employing machine learning techniques in the analysis of the innovation performance measures, this study offers an explanation of features clarifying variations in the intensity of innovation between nations. Proceeding by categorizing countries (121 countries used in our analysis) into 4 groups evolving in the same way, we highlight the common characteristics that allow a country to belong to a given group. Among the 49 innovation input indicators analyzed in this study, a subset of indicators, of which the importance and the impact on the national innovation system are the highest, is proposed. This subset of key indicators enhancing national innovation performance, contains mainly the ICT use, the University/industry research collaboration, the government effectiveness, the Logistics performance and the Gross Expenditure on R&D performed by business enterprise.

194,Information System Plan For West Corner Hotel (A Case  Study),"the west corner hotel (wch) is located in downtown olongapo city, at the center of the city. the hotel has 68 adequately furnished rooms complete with amenities for travelers. this paper aims to create a conceptual model or an applicable information system strategy to improve the use of information at the hotel staff’s disposal. the paper utilizes porter’s five forces of competition to analyze the external factors affecting the hotel. the current strategies of west corner are technology as a tool, staff training, budget-friendly, accommodations, and location strategy. their computing environment includes wi-fi, local area network, and their hotel management system software: a custom-built software. they also utilize facebook and google mail to communicate with customers. this paper has found that west corner is underutilizing their technology and the papers recommends to improve their facebook page’s messaging bot to improve their communication between customers and staff. the paper concludes that utilizing the facebook messaging bot through their facebook page would be able to improve the hotel’s day-to-day functions.","hotel management, swot/tows, porter’s 5","After a thorough analysis of the current state of the Information Systems and Information Technologies of the West Corner Hotel, it was found that the hotel is underutilizing the technology that is currently at its disposal. The paper utilized the frameworks of internal and external business analysis in creating a report within this paper, which was used to develop several strategies in line with West Corner’s Mission and Vision. The project that scored the highest and recommended by this paper would be pursuing Project 3: Facebook Frequently Asked Questions chat robot programming. This project achieved the highest score because it has various utility functions and low initial and running costs. Aside from answering customer’s questions, the bot could also be pre-programmed to show other information related to the hotel. Such as the hotel’s address and location on a map, give customers some recommendations for facilities to use in the hotel, and show previous ratings from old customers. In addition to its very low initial and running cost, short project development time, and potential customer satisfaction, this utility makes it a project that could be initiated immediately without spending too much investment. Programming or setting up the messaging bot is relatively easy due to Facebook’s user-friendly integrated development environment. If an FAQ bot was finished, then the next course of action would be the creation of a membership system that would allow the hotel to provide member only services for its customers, thus increasing the incentive for customers to keep utilizing the services of the hotel and reducing the risk of customers looking for substitutes. Lastly, if the hotel would opt for both the above strategies and would want to add more as their business grows, the proposed project would be the creation of a website for the hotel: this website could be made by a professional, with the owners and managers providing the website requirements, or be created by the hotel’s staff themselves reducing the potential cost. This website would then be used as an online front desk for the hotel and could be used as a central hub for members and staff where member only announcements, offers, and deals could be presented. A FAQ bot could also be integrated and programmed into the website in order to gain the benefits of the FAQ bot project.","milstein rei cadorniga, ashly mariel cruz, coleen dela cruz, kathleen suello, grace lorraine intal school of information technology, mapúa university, manila philippines mrbcadorniga@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, amccruz@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, cmdelacruz@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, kgisuello@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, gldintal@mapua.edu.ph",

First is customer satisfaction and customer retention, one way to satisfy your customers is to provide them a complete menu when they are ordering and make sure that the drinks, they usually order, which are the best sellers, are available. If there will be instances that they lack supplies or ingredients to be able to make their milk tea, frappes, coffee, and food, this can affect their relationship with their customers, and they might lead to ordering from the business' competitors. With this project, this can improve their current product differentiation, marketing strategy, and their manual managing of inventory. This can improve product differentiation because they can make new flavors by mixing the complete ingredients that they have that might produce a drink that will be loved by their customers. This can improve their marketing strategy by offering more drinks and exhibiting their whole menu every day because they are all available. Lastly, this will improve their manual management of their inventory and will lessen the chance of overlooking the lack of certain supplies. This will help the business in achieving their objectives, specially the second objective which is to provide the whole menu for the customer to choose from. This also has an impact on the third objective because the delays in preparing their orders will be lessened because the problem about insufficient management of inventory levels is eliminated. Looking at the cost and how the inventory management will be implemented, the business will be investing in a system that can last until they grow more or expand. This costs more and is harder to implement, but the effectiveness and efficiency that the system can offer is the investment that the business currently needs based on the problems that they are facing today. Knowing that La Teacia Artisan Milk tea is a small business that is rapidly growing, especially in the Rizal area, the inventory management system can support its growth and be utilized in the long term.","noel d. basañez, jr., angelica rose d. bauzon, kathleen r. santos, tristan andrei t. saura, grace lorraine intal school of information technology mapua university,makati city, philippines ndbasanez@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, ardbauzon@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, ksantos@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, tatsaura@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, gldintal@mymail.mapua.edu.ph",

198,Raw Material Supply Configuration With Short Shelf Life In  A Production Scenario Mts/Mto Minimizing Operational,"supply chains face challenges associated with operations natural conditions and products characteristics. there is a growing trend in the new risk identification that may be associated with public health, socioeconomic and environmental factors, which condition productive activities planning and execution. scrm aims to identifying, measuring and mitigating the risks in organizations. we developed a raw material supply methodology that allows defining material flow management policies (mts, mto), considering operating risks and costs. we identify risks and inventory positioning criteria with experts help. subsequently, we measure risk through a system dynamics simulation model and mitigation actions, through valorized scenarios that produce the raw material supply configuration with a short shelf life. this methodology was evaluated in a colombian meat products company. we compared the mto, mts according to ddmrp and mts according to coverage, under nine scenarios where demand and production sources were varied. operating costs results to mto methodology are better, with 48% decrease compared to mts according to ddmrp, and 28% compared to mts according to coverage. in terms of service level and robustness, the mts methodology according to coverage has a slight advantage with 99.62%, compared to mto and mts according to ddmrp, with 99.49% and 98.71% respectively.","scrm, mts, mto","Inventory positioning criteria must be taken into account when setting up a SC. This work shows the importance of including the characteristics of the products that are transformed throughout the operations in the SC. The shelf life creates an important restriction in this definition. The loss of the cold chain, impact by information disseminated in the mass media and uncertainty in the acquisition costs of RM and supplies are recognized as the most relevant risks in operations. Its materialization generates product loss, greater variation in demand or supply. Modeling the SC with a shelf life restriction in your products, allows you to link the largest number of process variables and evaluate the cost and risk of operations, and the appropriate configuration to manage inventories in each link. In this particular case, where the MRM has five days of shelf life, of which two are consumed in logistics operations, it is recommended to activate the productive nodes according to the MTO methodology. When inventory positioning is generated, either under DDMRP or under coverage, total costs can increase by 48% and 28% respectively. The costs of operations are highly sensitive to few changes in demand or production. Controlling the product flow using MTO, throughout a SC with a strong shelf life restriction, increases its robustness, by controlling the risks of expiration of its raw material. This without significantly affects the service level, which stands at 99.48%. Research on new performance measures for this type of SC is considered future work, accompanied by the need to model new instances, such as the coordination of activities when there are non-working days that consume the shelf life of the product. Additionally, the complete link of the financial chapter, by including the generated income and indicators such as EBITDA margin or ROIC, can provide a greater understanding of the full impact on the SC.","risk and cost lucas ramírez ramírez engineering magister program student universidad de antioquia medellín, colombia lucas.ramirezr@udea.edu.co carmen elena patiño rodríguez industrial engineering department universidad de antioquia medellín, colombia elena.patino@udea.edu.com gloria milena osorno osorio industrial engineering program unidad central del valle del cauca tuluá, colombia gosorno@uceva.edu.com",

The growth of solar power depends on its sustainability. The outcome of this solar power unsustainability investigation was highlighted, among other things, a lack of education on solar power. The root causes of solar power unsustainability were discovered in the region of KZN using the special tool for determining the root causes. There are indulgences (such as the solar power policy gap) that are hindering implementation of solar power in the region that eThekwini municipality needs to deal with. According to the root cause outcome, solar power sustainability relies on solar power (SP) policing, SP financing, SP technology controlling and understanding. Monyei et al., (2018) agreed that some solar power problems exist because of policy fall-out. The solar power root causes concluded that solar power installation was not growing as in other provinces such as the Western Cape. Financial support appeared to be the main obstacle to solar power installation as was outlined in the study. If solar power continues to be unsustainable in eThekwini municipality, the well-known impact will be increased energy demand and lack of sponsors to give financial support. The solar power financing will continue to depend on governmental support. As solar power implementation is not trusted by many citizens of eThekwini region, marketing of this commodity needs to be vastly improved.

205,Discrete Choice Models For Transportation Mode Choice: A  Systematic Literature Review,"the objective of this paper is to determine the current methods and data sources used to model mode choice for transportation of the population in universities and urban areas. we performed a systematic literature review to compare the different methods, techniques, data sources, and metrics used to model mode choice behavior and evaluate its performance. a mode choice model is a discrete choice model, which predicts a choice in a set of discrete alternatives; it describes the selection of a transportation mode from an individual, in disaggregated models, or a percentage of a population, in aggregated models. we collected a total of 60 primary studies after searching on different databases from 1982 to 2021, most of them being published in journals. the studied areas range from small regions, such as universities, to wider regions, like metropolitan areas. as most of the models in the studied research papers used data collected from surveys the authors created for that specific research, we advise to ensure that the data sources for the model training contain the required sample characteristics and variables. if such database is not available, performing a survey as an initial data gathering phase is recommended. another finding is that mode choice models can be categorized as econometric, in which parameter estimation is interpretable, and black box models, in which parameters are not explicit, therefore practical interpretations about the relation of each variable with the mode choice probability cannot be made. we conclude that applying econometric models is still recommended for initial experiences developing discrete choice models, as they continue to be widely used. given that they are composed of a utility function, followed by the application of a model, such as the logit and its variants, a recently used option consists of incorporating black box algorithms for the utility calculation, enhancing the quality of predictions, and then applying econometric models to keep parameter interpretability. the study and application of mode choice models have increased, having a growing number of publications in recent years. additionally, applied algorithms have evolved and range from specialized artificial neural networks such as the deep neural networks, to classification algorithms, such as the random forest classifier. therefore, we expect the relevance of this research area to continue growing as technology and new methods develop.","mode choice 2, mobility",,"juan estrada-garcía, juliana figueroa, ezequiel gonzález, jenny díaz-ramírez department of engineering universidad de monterrey san pedro garza garcía, mexico juanalberto.estrada@udem.edu, juliana.figueroa@udem.edu, ezequiel.gonzalezl@udem.edu, jenny.diaz@udem.edu",
206,Determining Strategies For The Perfect Shade Mobile  Application Using Swot Analysis And Six Thinking Hats,"product testing is vital when buying a cosmetic product to ensure it fits or looks good on someone's skin tone. in 2020, the world was hit by the covid-19, a deadly and contagious virus because it spreads when a person inhales an aerosol or droplets containing the virus. usually, cosmetic products are being tested by buyers through mall testers. mall testers have disease-causing bacteria that can lead to a skin infection. this study aims to assess a mobile application design that uses augmented reality and artificial intelligence to be a virtual consultant and skin analyzer. this study uses a survey questionnaire based on six thinking hats to gather data and swot analysis to analyze the data. based on the collected data, the researchers conclude that a virtual try-on is effective in trying a cosmetic product and will be patronized by makeup enthusiasts and artists. for women in their late adolescence or early adulthood, the perfect shade has a lot of appeals. according to the findings, the group should market the product by micromarketing to beauty gurus online. investing in a robust ai algorithm will increase the product's security against security concerns.","cosmetic products, augmented reality, mobile application","The researchers were able to collect data that encapsulates the preference of the users and reveal areas of improvement by using the six thinking hats strategy. The six thinking hats strategy effectively dig deep into the user's thoughts and develop a marketable version of the service product. The design effectively revealed what the service product should retain, improve, and how it should market. The Perfect Shade has high marketability for women in the late adolescents or young adulthood stage. The group is found to be conscious both in their appearance and the application's potential benefits in their daily life. The researchers discovered that the marketing, use of innovative technology, and safety are the strategies that should be further improved and developed to ensure the marketability of the application. Based on the research, the group should market the product by appealing to beauty guru's online through micro marketing. Beauty gurus are vital to making human connections and utilizing their influence on those who watch them. The effect of these micro populations would impact the potential buyers, assuring them that the product is worth the use because beauty gurus have a positive review on them. The study showed that the use of innovative technology delivers convenience to its customers. It enables them to do things at a click of a button. As technology continues to evolve, the possibilities our mobile phones bring become limitless. To improve the product's safety against security issues, investing in a good AI algorithm that won't collect any data from the device after the user permits the application is better. Also, the mobile application should provide a pop-up message that will notify the users that it will need permission to get the photo that the users want to edit.","bryelle timothy c. nisperos, joshua yñigo n. pascual, jerome patrick s. ramos, grace lorraine d. intal school of information technology mapua university makati, philippines btcnisperos@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, jypascual@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, jpsramos@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, gldintal@mapua.edu.ph",

208,Online Scheduling System For Doctors And Patients In A  Hospital,"the outpatient department (opd) of a hospital provides diagnoses for non-urgent patients that do not require them to be admitted for long periods. the department has multiple physical facilities and medical equipment with several doctors and consulting rooms, each is an expert in a specific field. this study aims to create an online scheduling system for the outpatient department of a hospital. it will be an online system that will assist the appointment system of the outpatient department of a hospital. this will benefit not only the hospital but also the patients in scheduling their appointments as the patient can check the doctor’s availability. the waiting time of the patient will be lessened since the patient will only go to the hospital at their specified scheduled appointment. the list of appointments can also be viewed by the doctor to check how many patients are currently scheduled within the day.","special situations, appointment system","Compared to the manual appointment system that is currently being used by the hospital, the website will improve the appointment system of the outpatient department. According to the hospital, patients can schedule an appointment by calling or through walk-ins as long as there is an available doctor. With the website, patients can easily view all the available schedules of doctors and set an appointment. In terms of payment, the patient can pay on the day of their appointment or pay in advance through GCash or PayMaya. The website also sends an SMS notification to remind patients about their scheduled appointment. It reminds them of their appointment a day before and on the day itself. Following the website’s evaluation, the calculated average SUS score of the system is 79.5. Which is equivalent to B according to the SUS Score Guideline table. In terms of adjective rating, the system is rated as Good which means that the website is usable. After testing, the doctor and hospital staff gave feedbacks about the website. They have mentioned that the flow of the website is nicely done and it was easy to use. The expected patients who have tested the website says that they have not seen anything that could potentially confuse users, it is very well made, and does not limit those who are not tech savvy. The doctor has also mentioned that the History of Illness and Personal History should also be added in the medical records section of the patient. These features were added after the testing. The researchers have also asked the doctor and hospital staff if the system will help in reducing the waiting time inside the hospital. They have mentioned that the system will help especially during a pandemic since everyone needs to adjust to the new normal. Aside from that, the hospital staff said that it will be less hassle for them, and it would be much easier since they do not need to manually count how many appointments are scheduled within the day.

209,Acoustic Noise And Force Reduction Of High Speed  Switched Reluctance Motor By Rotor Designs,"this paper presents a simple procedure for acoustic noise reduction in switched reluctance motors (srms). radial forces between rotor and stator teeth cause a vibration of stator laminations and windings. the vibrations lead to acoustic noise. the radial forces can be determined by the two-dimensional finite element method (fem). the magnitude of the acoustic noise at any operating speed is calculated by an analytical model which depends on the radial forces and circumferential deflection. the calculation, simulation, and measurement results are useful to improve stator and rotor poles with acoustic noise reduction. moreover, the srm needs to avoid the mechanical resonant frequency. if the electric frequency equals mechanical resonant frequency, the vibration and acoustic noise are extremely high and destroy the mechanical structure of the high-speed motor.",turn-on,"The acoustic noise level has been measured with speed up to 47,000 rpm and the noise spectrum frequency was analyzed for different speeds. To improve the acoustic noise performance of the SRM, there were some proposals of changing the shape of the stator or rotor teeth. To reduce the radial force, the corners of the stator teeth have changed to a round shape to decrease the radial force. The stiffness of the stator yokes was increased to reduce the deformation of the stator. Due to the rotor has salient poles, the air gaps between rotor teeth and slots are not equal and the high velocity of the air blocks in rotor slots can create the acoustic noise significantly. To reduce this part of the acoustic noise, a tapped-shoe rotor pole can be designed to improve acoustic noise and vibration problems.

210,Purview Of The Baseline’S Construction For Vehicle Fuel  Economy And Its Statistical Limitations,"a baseline in fuel economy is the indicator from which to start to evaluate consumption and raise awareness of the current state. since what is not measured cannot be improved, the determination of a baseline helps to locate a starting point to establish further goals and best practices based on actual behavior. this paper explores and reviews the studies for fuel economy to determine the measurement and analysis methods that aim to the construction of fuel consumption and/or gas emission baselines by conducting a systematic literature review (slr). the overview of literature published globally in the last ten years shows hardly any research focused on hdvs, as well as few investigations reporting gross and load weight values. studies committed to measuring fuel consumption and/or gas emissions show small sample sizes due to limitations in scope related to the methods used, explaining the tendency to make estimates through statistical and estimation tools. furthermore, it is important to emphasize that by abounding in the methods and the literature itself, the recent interest in expanding the sample sizes in line with the precision of the data, has presented new techniques for the measurement and estimation.","fuel consumption, baseline","The literature reviewed is mainly interested in vehicular emissions with a preference in measuring to aim for real behavior results. Nevertheless, limitations present on measuring techniques due to time, costs, and scope, have presented a recent trend (since 2018) on testing unconventional methods and techniques. Likewise, estimation models have been type-casted to the same common models until 2017, when new tool start taking place and studies attempt to combine estimation model with measured data instead of studying inventories alone. Limitations from both measuring and estimating methods are summed-up on costs, time, reliability of the data, sample sizes and significance in comparison with real behavior data. The purview of this methods presents an opportunity to choose unconventional geolocation tools along with new proposed estimation models for the determination of the fuel consumption baseline for HDVs in the Mexican region for the new UNEP’s project. 4.1 Further research Measuring techniques with specific data outputs limit sample sizes and analysis for high variety of factors, pointing out how geolocation tools and simple measurement related ones have a greater area of opportunity for the project purposes. For estimation models, to bet for programs used to extrapolate or even estimate for massive sample sizes applied is more promising than limiting to basic statistical analysis. With this being stated, further research is expected for innovative methods and their availability on the studied region to make possible the determination of the fuel consumption baseline for HDVs in the UNEP project.","samantha villarreal-cavazos, mariana luis-gonzález, miguel camacho-assad and jenny díaz industrial and systems engineering school university de monterrey san pedro garza garcía, nl 66238, méxico samantha.villarrealc@udem.edu; mariana.luis@udem.edu; miguel.camacho@udem.edu; jenny.diaz@udem.edu josé i. huertas and antonio e. mogro school of engineering and science-eic tecnológico de monterrey monterrey, méxico jhuertas@tec.mx; amogro@tec.mx",

214,Online Food Delivery (Ofd) Apps:   What Do The Customers Look At?,"the online food delivery (ofd) application is the software application that connects the restaurants and customers through online. in this pandemic covid-19, the ofd app makes food selection and purchases become easy. as a result, the purpose of this study is to determine customer preferences in ofd apps using the best worst method (bwm). the selection of customer preferences criteria consists of price, design, convenience and time. the quantitative method is applied by disseminating a survey to ofd apps customers in parit raja, malaysia through whatsapp medium within two months. based on the convenience sampling method, 112 surveys were received, however, 11 surveys does not meet the requirements. therefore, only 101 surveys were analyzed using bwm. according to the findings, pricing is still the most essential factor for customers, followed by time, convenience, and design. this article also includes recommendations for ofd providers to improve their services.","best worst method, (2017)","In conclusion, despite Alalwan's (2020) finding that there is no substantial association between price and customers' intention, pricing remains an important criterion for OFD app customers. The price value is important for customers' OFD apps for a variety of reasons, which support the claim by Prasetyo et al., (2021). To begin with, the price listed in ODF apps is slightly more than conventional restaurant costs, and it varies by provider. In addition, delivery charges and tax fees are included in the total amount and the delivery rates range amongst OFD suppliers as well. However, the meal pricing for Foodpanda differs between delivery and pick-up choices, with pick-up being somewhat less expensive. Nevertheless, certain OFD providers, such as GrabFood and Foodpanda, offer discounts for specific restaurants, including free delivery, hot deals, promotions, and vouchers that contribute positive perceptions to customers as mentioned by Prasetyo et al., (2021). The customer's preference for the second criterion is time. Since the OFD applications are primarily designed for people who do not have time to go to a restaurant, it has created a new expectation among customers that their meals would be delivered within a specified time frame. To address this, certain OFD apps show the status of meals being prepared and delivered once payment has been made, and customers can even contact the rider through the OFD app. The customer's third selection criteria is convenience. The OFD apps have features that make it easier for customers to use the apps, such as a favourite button, a list of prior orders, a reorder button, a preorder function, notification, a chat support button, live meal preparation and delivery status, and the ability to contact the rider. Aside from that, the OFD is aided by a variety of alternatives payments. Finally, the design of OFD apps contributes less to client preferences, even though the apps/web must provide a user-friendly experience to match customer expectations (Yee et al., 2018). Based on observation, some suggestions for improvement to the OFD provider include the ability to upload a picture of the meal for information sharing, the extension of feedback comment periods, and an enhancement in the notification of minimum purchase rules. By uploading a photo of the food being delivered, customers will have access to preliminary information such as the portion size, a comparison of the actual food to the published menu, and a price and food comparison. Meanwhile, feedback comments are critical for OFD providers and restaurants to improve. Customer feedback is currently unavailable for Halo app; however, for Foodpanda, the feedback form only appears before subsequent orders for a limited time, allowing users to score the rider, packing, and punctuality of the entire ordering process. Meanwhile, there are two types of feedback for GrabFood: one for rider ratings and another for ordering food ratings. Interestingly, minimum purchase rules set by OFD providers for specific restaurants result in additional charges for customers who refuse to follow the regulations due to oversight. To avoid this, it is recommended that the OFD provider improve their modus operandi on alerting customers. Due to its focus only in the Parit Raja area, this study is unable to generalize to the Malaysian context. Other than that, high-level bias Furthermore, convenience sampling has a higher level of bias, making it impossible to generalize the results to the entire population.

215,Material Flows Prediction For Dynamic Facility Layout  Problems Via Machine Learning Algorithms,"today, intense competition environment, more frequent changes of product mix, seasonal demand variables, etc. situations push companies to make various efforts to reduce production costs. one of these studies is the facility layout study, which is very effective on costs due to the material flows. facility layout is the problem of arranging the facilities in a way that will minimize material movements within the facility and ensure continuous flow. with the facility layout, minimum cost facility locations can be determined by considering material movements. in the dynamic facility arrangement problem, the aim is to determine the material flow, demand variability, product mix changes, etc. in periods. it is the redefinition of the facility layout according to the changes caused by the circumstances. the dynamic facility layout problem considers material handling costs and department relocation costs simultaneously across the planning horizon. the most significant parameter in this problem is to determine the demand or material flow requests during planning horizon. therefore, this study aims to predict the in-bound material flow accurately that will occur in the future periods. in this context, in-plant material flows were predicted by linear regression, polynomial regression, random forest algorithm, and prophet algorithm. then the performance of these algorithms was evaluated with mean absolute error, mean squared error, root mean squared error, and mean absolute percentage error. thus, the predicted inter-departmental material flows in the future periods can be used in the solution of facility layout problem.","machine learning, mexico",,"adem erik, yusuf kuvvetli çukurova university, graduate school of natural and applied sciences, department of industrial engineering, balcalı campus, 01330 sarıçam, adana,turkey, admerk01@gmail.com çukurova university, engineering faculty, department of industrial engineering, balcalı campus, 01330 sarıçam, adana,turkey, ykuvvetli@cu.edu.tr",
216,Optimal Location Of A Central Warehouse For A Retail  Painting Company: Practical Case In Mexico,the present paper is a case study based on a retail painting company (sme: small and medium-sized enterprise) located in mexico that built a central warehouse to save money by improving its inventory management. the fermat- weber facility location problem was studied and applied to obtain the optimal location for the mentioned warehouse. the proposal was validated throughout the roi methodology to ensure necessary financial results achieving a cost reduction and investment return within the first year of operation of the new warehouse. it is paramount important for current smes to apply exact methodologies to improve their cash flow and promote their existence among other companies in such a competitive business environment. the authors' primary purpose is to use an existent model in a real case that can be replicated by any retail sme obtaining cost improvements.,"central warehouse, smes, retail logistics","on the results is the possibility of improving the company's cash flows through the establishment of the central warehouse, which will, in the first instance, represent an additional income to the company by establishing inventories adequate to the actual demand to meet the cost of the proposed investment. At the same time, the obsolete or slow-moving inventory will be converted into liquidity for the company, as a single occasion, given the opportunity to significantly increase the turnover of its stocks that will be reflected as an increase in profits by considerably reducing the investment stationed for long periods and costs associated with this activity. By applying the Lean philosophy of an industry that involves a ""pulling"" methodology, it is considered that the proposed facility will allow branches to order material only when it is required for sale. By modifying the current practices in which we seek to push material that is lagging by having over the inventory of specific goods. It is also necessary to emphasize the importance of measuring the proposed warehouse's operation by using performance indicators as a future proposal to identify improvements, and action plans are suggested for those aspects that require it. 7. Conclusion As exemplified during the development of this case study, there are many methodologies for improving supply chain processes. However, SMEs’ suitability is a branch of knowledge little studied in an approach such as the supply chain and specifically the warehouses as a tool for cost control. Adapting existing methodologies to a real case within SMEs' context represents an opportunity to increase their competitiveness in today's markets, which are becoming increasingly professional, since knowing how companies create and manage a competitive advantage represents a fundamental element in strategic management. One of the intentions set out before developing this case study was to provide a tool for other SMEs to improve their operational and strategic processes. This goal was achieved by proposing generic models that can be replicated with moderate adjustments according to each company's nature, processes, and specific needs. The study shows that, although there are many case studies focused mainly on large supply chains, little is said about their application to smaller companies, whose impact can generate a significant economic benefit by implementing changes within the traditional operational form of these companies. These models can provide a high utility for the development of logistics projects, considering measuring their effectiveness based on the improvements' profitability, as was done in this case study where one was obtained with an ROI of 44%. This study continues to be developed on great relevance when considering the economic context in which this work has been carried out. Since there are a large number of companies that meet these characteristics, generating 72% of employment and 52% of Mexico's GDP (Sánchez, 2020), so the implementation of a project like a case study can develop a more significant opportunity for success within the market not only to continue operating but increasing their chances of growth, which will generate new opportunities for expansion and employment generation.","luis antonio guzmán-garcía, diana sánchez-partida, josé luis martínez-flores and patricia cano-olivos department of logistics and supply chain management, upaep university, 17 sur 901, barrio de santiago, cp 72410 puebla, puebla, mexico universidad popular autónoma del estado de puebla puebla, puebla 72410, mex luisantonio.guzman@upaep.edu.mx, diana.sanchez@upaep.mx,joseluis.martinez01@upaep.mx, patricia.cano@upaep.mx",
217,Multi-Period Multi-Depot Location-Routing Problem  For Mobile Center-Based Last Mile Delivery,"the last mile delivery volume has been gradually increasing worldwide, and in particular, the volume trend is expected to accelerate dramatically due to covid-19. furthermore, the expansion of the last mile delivery market negatively impacts social and environmental issues (urban traffic congestion, greenhouse gas emissions, etc.) owing to the delivery system employing internal combustion engine delivery trucks in metropolitan areas. therefore, mobile centers for the last mile delivery have been studied to solve the previously stated issues. that is because mobile centers can enable the active use of eco-friendly transportation, be easily relocated, and be installed in empty spaces in the city. in this study, we consider this problem as the multi-period multi-depot location-routing problem to operate a mobile center efficiently. we present a 2-phase method for the addressed problem and develop a heuristic algorithm. the first phase of the proposed method is formulated as a stochastic dynamic programming model for the multi-period locating problem, and the second phase is constructed as a mixed-integer programming model for the multi-depot routing problem.","mobile center, last mile delivery",,"minseo choi and taesu cheong school of industrial management engineering korea university seoul, 02841, south korea iemschoi@korea.ac.kr, tcheong@korea.ac.kr",

219,Resource Allocation Models To Meet The United States  Hospitals Urgent Need Of Ventilators During The Covid-19,"during the coronavirus disease of the 2019 pandemic, there was a shortage of ventilators to meet the medical demands of the united states hospitals. coronavirus patients with severe conditions lose the ability to breathe by themselves and require a ventilator, which pumps air in and out of the lungs. the response to the ventilator shortage created many situations: automakers started to manufacture ventilators to help the medical device companies grow ventilators production. additionally, engineering students at different u.s. universities invented low-cost ventilators in university laboratories, and three-dimensional printed ventilators started to be manufactured. these solutions would be helpful in the long term. however, the urgent need for ventilators necessitates strategies for allocating these minimal available ventilators to assist the decision-makers and healthcare providers in u.s. hospitals. to compensate this challenge, proper resource allocation of ventilators makes the best use of these available ventilators to increase society's economic and ethical benefits. in this paper, two models of resource allocation will be studied: 1) a smart resource allocation advisor using the cost-benefit-analysis to allocate limited ventilators in a specific hospital, and 2) a stochastic optimization model for allocating and sharing ventilators among the states.",china,"In this paper, two models of resource allocation of ventilators during the COVID-19 pandemic were studied. The algorithms used, experiments implemented, limitations, and future work for the cost-benefit analysis-based model and the stochastic optimization based-model were explained. These models helped in the distribution of ventilators among the U.S. after the shortage happened in the COVID-19 pandemic. There are many other models available in research for resource allocation in healthcare facilities during disasters. Operations research played a role in creating these models. Operation research is a discipline that brings together expertise from various fields, including applied mathematics, computer science, and systems engineering to help in the decision-making process (Vieira et al. 2016).","pandemic: a review duaa nawafleh, m.sc., alexandr m. sokolov, ph.d., and niamat ullah ibne hossain, ph.d. engineering management program arkansas state university state university, ar 72467, usa dnawafleh@astate.edu, asokolov@astate.edu, nibnehossain@astate.edu",
220,How Good Or Bad Is The Prediction Of Black-Box Covid-19  Models After One Year Has Lapped?,"in this paper we present a report on the performance of two black-box mathematical models of covid-19 prediction. the models are the growth equation models: modified verhulst logistic model and the morgan-mercer-flodin (mmf) model. both models predict the cumulative numbers of infected people using the covid-19 data of indonesia from begining day of the infection to end of september 2020. the covid-19 pandemic data in indonesia from the worldometer website (worldometer 2020) will be used as the underlying data for the curve fitting to those two models. we use the time series data of the total confirmed cases and the daily new cases to fit to the model models. we used the data starting on 2 march, the official first day of the reported pandemic cases in indonesia, up to 30 november 2020. we used the models to fit the time series of the total confirmed cases by minimizing the minimum root of the mean square error (rmse) to obtained the parameterized models. after a year has been lapped, we compare the prediction from those parameterized models to the actual number of infected people for the same country, from the beginning of epidemic to 30 august 2021. the results show that for certain condition (different assumptions of the two models) the models could predict the number in a relatively good accuracy, at least qualitatively could portray the shape of the cumulative number of infected people curve.","covid-19 pandemic, empirical model, indonesia","We modeled the pandemic data of Indonesia (the total/cumulative confirmed cases data) from the Worldometer website (Worldometer 2020) using two growth functions: the original logistic function and the modified logistic function. The results show that the logistic function fails to estimate the carrying capacity K of the total confirmed cases data. The model shows that, in terms of total confirmed cases pandemic data of Indonesia, at this date the disease should have already reached the carrying capacity K, which is in fact untrue. The inaccuracy becomes apparent when we plot the daily new cases which clearly depart form the observed data. Meanwhile, the results also show that the modified logistic equation is able to estimate the carrying capacity Kα of the total confirmed cases and produces curve that satisfactorily fits the data. However if we look at the result for the daily new cases, the model also shows that at this date the disease should have already reached the carrying capacity Kα, which is also untrue. This concludes that while the modified logistic model is able to mimic the total confirmed cases data, it still fails to fit the daily new cases data. Further refinement of the model still need to be done. This is currently under investigation. There is some reasons why the logistic growth model does not fit for COVID-19 data. One of them is when it is applied too early in which the disease still in the exponential growth phase, such as in the case of Indonesia COVID-19 data (https://www.researchgate.net/post/Logistic_Growth_Model_Is_it_suitable_for_COVID-19). The process of the logistic model refinement above bearing a good pedagogical example in teaching mathematical modeling.

221,Coordination And Non Coordination  Lease Contract Model  With Availability Target,"a lease contract (lc) model for a fleet of dump truck with availability target is developed in this paper. under this lc, the lessor provides a full maintenance service during the period lc. to sustain high performance of the fleet, we proposed an availability target as performance of the lc. in addition, the lessor gives some incentive in term of a price discount if the lessee leases more dump trucks. the optimal decisions from the lessor’s viewed point (maintenance policy i.e number of periodic maintenance, maintenance level, pricing policy) are to minimize the total cost. the decision problem for the lessee is to select the best option suitable to its requirement. we provide numerical examples for illustrating the optimal decisions for the lessee, and the lessor, which maximizes the expected profit for each party.","lease contract, production price, discount","In this paper, we have devised a mathematical model for a lease equipment, in which the lease is sold for a fleet of the equipment. The fleet is leased for a period of time and during the lease contract, imperfect PM is performed. We find the optimal value of maintenance parameters such that minimizing expected cost of the lessor. Since nowadays, two-dimensional lease are abound in the market, it is important to consider these two-dimensional approach in dealing with failures. A bivariate distribution of those failures can be estimated using real data from related industries, such as mining industry. A game theory approach can be also considered as one alternative to address optimization in that two-dimensional problem.

222,Traffic Light Status Detection Using Apv Method,"one of the supporting aspects of electronic traffic law enforcement (etle) is the detection of traffic light status. this detection is used to determine whether someone driving a vehicle violates a traffic light or not. there are several ways to find out the status of the traffic lights that can be done, including what is often done is to install a system embedded in the traffic light system and then send a message to the traffic light status etle system from time to time. in this study, the status of the traffic lights is obtained by analyzing a still image from closed-circuit television (cctv) using opencv and then comparing the average pixels values (apv’s) in some area to get a conclusion about whether the traffic lights are in a certain color condition. in experiments conducted this method can detect the status of traffic lights with an accuracy of more than 99%.",etle,"and Future Works As stated in the introduction above, this research is part of the bigger research of Electronic Traffic Law Enforcement (ETLE). The research on APV will later be used in the ETLE system that is being built to determine the status of active traffic lights in real time. When the traffic light status is in red condition, then the vehicle that exceeds the limit to stop will be declared as violate and will be further processed by police officers. For system reliability, it is also necessary to find a treatment to overcome the occurrence of calculation errors during the day. Although the percentage that happens is very small, this can be a problem if someone is found guilty while what actually happens is because of a color reading error.

230,Systemic Analysis Of The Electrification Of Last-Mile Freight  Transport,"the growth of the urban population has permanently increased the demand for products. likewise, the maturation of electronic commerce has increased urban freight transport, which has brought negative externalities such as emissions, pollution, noise, congestion, and loss of habitat. there is a visible effort to make urban last-mile deliveries more sustainable, mainly in environmental aspects. this is the reason for an interest in replacing conventional vehicles with electric vehicles, but this replacement has a series of conditions. the objective of this document is to systematically analyze the electrification of last-mile freight transport. from the review of the state of the art, affirmations were identified that allowed to establish cause and effect relationships between different attributes of the system that is represented, in such a way that, a causal diagram was obtained that systemically expresses the studied situation. as a result, we identify that social dissatisfaction because of particulate matter emissions generates social pressure that promotes incentives for the electrification of last-mile transportation and generates an increase in the sales of electric vehicles, thus reducing the sales of conventional vehicles.","electrification, last mile, electric vehicles, freight","Transport is causing problems in urban areas, particularly freight transport, because online sales and globalization have increased because of the dynamism of societies. This, in turn, leads to new trends in freight transport and it is expected that more goods will be delivered shortly. Most of the goods delivered end up in city centers, considering that last-mile logistics is the least efficient stage of the supply chain, improving last-mile logistics and a significant reduction in externalities are issues of great relevance. Driven by commitments, interests, new laws, and regulations on greenhouse gas emissions, transporters are starting to use electric vehicles for last-mile deliveries. However, this migration to EVs has a series of challenges and difficulties, such as the cost of vehicles, the absence of recharging infrastructure, the storage capacity of batteries, the lack of incentives to promote the importation and purchase of EVs. EVs, among others. For the development of this document, from the review of literature, statements were identified that allowed the constitution of causal relationships, which were included in a causal diagram that systemically expresses the situation studied. When conducting the analysis, we identified that tax incentives condition the increase in sales of both electric and conventional vehicles, given that the existence of incentives that reduce the cost of EVs promotes their sale because it decreases the value to be financed by the buyer, while that if there are no incentives for EVs, transport companies will prefer to purchase conventional vehicles. Given that last mile transportation will continue to increase significantly, governments must promote the necessary incentives, both tax, and non-tax, to indirectly reduce emissions and diversify the basket of the transportation sector. As future work, we intended to bring the causal diagram built to a System Dynamics model with simulations that allows evaluating different scenarios.","julieth stefany garcía collazos facultad de minas universidad nacional de colombia medellín, colombia jugarciaco@unal.edu.co laura milena cárdenas facultad de ingeniería universidad de antioquia medellín, colombia lauram.cardenas@udea.edu.co carlos jaime franco facultad de minas universidad nacional de colombia medellín, colombia cjfranco@unal.edu.co",

Although this research was a limited and subjective research intended to car and motorcycle driver, it was found that each item on the SDDQ and DBQ was able to assess distraction or even driving behaviour quite well. Based on the data collection and analysis that has been carried out, it was found that in Indonesia, the tendency of a person’s driving behavior might be influenced by the driver’s involvement in distraction while driving. The respondents of this study were dominated by young Indonesian drivers ranging from 18 – 24 years old. It was also found that the majority of respondents were more often involved in conversations with passengers which resulted in declined driver alertness and lapses in driving. The existence of the moderator variable also had a significant influence on driving behavior, in which, may occur due to differences in experience and comprehension related traffic hazards. Indeed, it might have an impact on the emergence of risky driving behavior in young Indonesian drivers in line with the increase of accidents. further research could can be done on one vehicle object to increase accuracy of the research. Conducting objective research could also be a choice to better understand other factors that may influence driving behavior.","manik mahachandra industrial engineering department, faculty of engineering center for biomechanics, biomaterial, biomechatronics, and biosignal processing university of diponegoro, semarang, central java, indonesia manik.mahachandra@ft.undip.ac.id wina d. oktavia and excel verlieson industrial engineering department, faculty of engineering diponegoro university semarang, central java 50269, indonesia winadeb@gmail.com, verlieson1@gmail.com muhammad ragil suryoputro industrial engineering study program, faculty of industrial technology indonesian islamic university, yogyakarta, indonesia ragil.suryoputro@uii.ac.id",

237,A Qfd-Ahp Method For Bridges Structural System  Selection During The Conceptual Design Phase,"selection of structural system for new highway bridges during the conceptual design stage is critical to the success of the project and meeting stakeholders’ requirements. during bridge conceptual design, a large set of subjective requirements must be considered and evaluated in terms of multiple criteria. in addition, it is critical to incorporate client needs and expectation during the conceptual design stage to achieve their satisfaction toward the delivery stage of the project. for this reason, this paper is proposing an integrated methodology to improve the decision-making process during bridge conceptual design. the proposed methodology utilises the quality function deployment (qfd) method to translate client needs into design requirements and the analytic hierarchy process (ahp) to prioritizes competing alternatives based on multicriteria decision analysis. the main advantage of integrating qfd and ahp is their ability to rank the design alternatives in order of their effectiveness in meeting client needs. while the qfd analysis has the power to optimize the designers’ solutions from the point of view of quality engineering, the ahp analysis helps to make the best decision in a multicriteria decision-making situation.",2000). moreover,,"mohammad al ayoub department of civil engineering university of sharjah sharjah, uae mohad1996@gmail.com saleh abu dabous department of civil engineering university of sharjah sharjah, uae sabudabous@sharjah.ac.ae mohammed alsharqawi township of south stormont long sault, ontario, canada mohammed@southstormont.ca",
238,How The Use Of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles To Detect Lost  Energy In Buildings Leads To Sustainabilitya Systematic,"to develop more sustainable societies, industries should focus on solving environmental and economic challenges using unmanned aerial vehicles (uavs) technologies for monitoring and energy auditing of buildings. building defects, such as heat loss, moisture, and air leakage, inevitably lead to inefficient space heating or cooling, essentially explaining high energy consumption and associated emissions. uavs contain modern monitoring equipment and thermal cameras to document building performance energy, creating digital models, and 3d photogrammetry. by advanced technology of uavs, energy auditors can analyze the energy used rapidly and accurately while reducing operational costs and minimizing safety risks by reaching remote or inaccessible areas without compromising the pilot's life. this paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of how the use of uavs for energy audit leads to sustainability through a systematic review of seventeen studies by following the steps of prisma. the results reveal that the uavs contribute to improving the energy performance of the building, which leads to reducing carbon emissions, saving energy costs, and improving human life and health. in this study, i attempted to shed light on how the use of uavs drives sustainability by focusing on the economy, energy consumption, environmental impacts, social and safety issues.","sustainability, building's energy","UAVs technology has massive potential and is a solution to the challenges of the energy audit. With the advancement of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, we will witness new technologies and improvements to advance the energy monitoring process by using UAVs that detect and analyze lost energy in buildings to reach the highest levels of quality in maintenance, auditing. Energy processing work will become automated, requiring less human input, participation, and expectedly yielding more accurate results. UAVs are estimated to cut audit time and increase reporting accuracy, resulting in reliability (Oh, Ham and Lee, 2021). This paper has presented how the use of UAVs for energy audit leads to sustainability in three main sectors (environment and energy consumption, economy, and safety sector), based on up-to-date published literature. The battery power is drained at different rates depending on how it is operated. In the case of wall crack inspection, UAVs inevitably must travel upwards. However, thrust and acceleration are the two motions that drain the battery quickly. Thus, it is critical to minimize the thrust and acceleration motions while navigating and inspecting walls. To reach the goal of making a drone travel its maximum. Solar energy can be used to charge the UAVs for longer and safer audit energy flights. The author firmly believes that more research is needed to develop UAVs for energy audit as one of the main contributors to achieve sustainability. Due to some weak capabilities in UAVs, such as the battery save and their inability to fly in some rainy and windy weather conditions. In conclusion, there are integrated interrelationships between UAVs for energy auditing, energy consumption, environmental impact, economy, and safety sector that are shown in Figure 5. a Causal Loop Diagram by Vensim software.

241,Analysis Of The Impact Of Capital Structure In The  Innovation Of A Firm Using The Techniques Of Financial,"one of the crucial aspects for a firm is to choose the right mixture of debt and equity to make a financial decision. while debt is a cheaper source of equity as it offers tax savings, there are other financial risks associated with the use of debt such as high-interest rates and cash flow difficulty. equity is less risky, but more expensive when compared to debt financing. it might take several years to gain returns from an innovative project, and all companies do not have enough internal resources to invest in research and development which is one of the main reasons companies seek external financing sources. in this paper, the use of debt/equity and its impacts on the innovative activities of a firm will be discussed. a rigorous study of the impact of leverage on the research and development expenses of a firm (a proxy of innovation) will be conducted with the help of regression analysis to show that debt financing of a company is not directly related to the innovation output of a firm when the market value of firms are controlled. this study explores meaningful insights on how capital structure affects the technological innovation of a company.","capital structure, debt and equity, innovation, financial leverage","Using different financing sources have their own pros and cons. While it is cheaper to use debt because of its tax benefits, it can be a concern to the firm because of high interest rate and cash flow difficulties.

242,Strengthening The Competitiveness Of Micro Enterprises  Using A Categorical Test Approach With Syntax Method,"the purpose of this research is to find out how to increase the competitiveness of micro-enterprises when they want to enter international trade in an effort to expand the market. the scope of the research focuses only on micro-enterprises in the province of east java, which actually have superior products and can be used as export commodities to neighboring countries that have an interest in micro-business products from east java. the research study uses several variables related to activities to increase competitiveness in order to open export markets where data collection uses a questionnaire instrument and uses a categorical test approach through syntax analysis. with the syntax method, the relevant variables appear clearly in the quadrant map. the categorical test method using syntax is still rarely used in research, even though the test results are accurate for the field of social science. through the syntax testing process, it turns out that all the variables used have different contributions in each city. and in almost all cities that are used as research objects, their micro- enterprises still need a lot of improvement, even though the products of these micro-enterprises appear to be superior and in demand abroad. the study in this study used limited variables, not covering all variables related to global micro-enterprise management, due to space limitations and other technical constraints. the results of this study can be used as material for study and consideration as well as input for the local government of east java in making programs related to increasing the competitiveness of micro-enterprises. the focus of the discussion in this research is slightly different from other studies, because the focus is on the development of regional products or local products that have the potential to develop in the international market. this type of paper is empirical-objective so it does not involve the subjective point of view of the researcher, measure, observe and analyze for solutions. proceedings of the international conference on industrial engineering and operations management monterrey, mexico, november 3-5, 2021 © ieom society international 1998",,,"i putu artaya, rizal bahaswan departement of management, departement of civil engineering narotama university surabaya putu.artaya@narotama.ac.id, rizal.bahaswan@narotama.ac.id mohammad roesli departement of law merdeka university surabaya roesli.unmer@gmail.com sulistyani eka lestari departement of law sunan bonang university tuban sulis_usb@yahoo.com nurmawati departement of industry engineering 45 university surabaya nurmawati22765@gmail.com setya haksama, devita anggraini lestari department of public health airlangga university surabaya setyahaksama@fkm.unair.ac.id, devita-anggraini-lestari-2021@fkm.unair.ac.id",
243,The Effects Of Poor Internal Quality On Customer  Satisfaction,"current advances in manufacturing technology have made the automotive market much more competitive. customers are seeking the best products at the lowest possible cost. to maintain the best possible working relationship, it is every supplier’s responsibility to ship products that meet the requirements and are on time. this paper will focus on how internal scrap costs can directly correlate to externally received customer complaints. quality scrap is a large driver in cost, shipment timing, and customer satisfaction. every part made internally that is defective is at risk of being shipped to the customer. the higher the scrap cost the more likely a supplier is to ship a bad part. this will cause customers to lose faith in the supplier’s ability to produce a quality part and may lead to the customer seeking a different supplier in the future. to verify this relationship, a study was done on 4 different business groups in a company, comparing the percentage of internal scrap vs. overall sales per month and the complaints received. the results show that there is a relationship between internal scrap cost and customer complaints, but there are other factors that can contribute.",,"The study showed that there is a potential correlation between scrap costs and the number of complaints received for business units 3 and 4 and that there is likely no correlation for units 1 and 2. However, this data can be misleading, and the study should more than likely be repeated. When pulling together the data the scrap cost was pulled for the entire process, not just the final process. For business units 3 and 4 there are not a lot of sub-processes therefore the total scrap cost is very close to that of the final operation, while business units 1 and 2 have multiple operations that can highly increase the overall scrap and potentially skewing the results seen. There is also a factor that is not considered and that is the technology being used to evaluate these defects. If the defects are being captured by a 100% vision check or functional test, then the risk of getting to the customer is minimal and therefore can produce a large scrap value without a complaint. Robots and in-process inspection systems equipped with machine vision solutions are used for increased flexibility and quality in automated manufacturing (Oleksandr Semeniuta, Sebastian Dransfeld, Kristian Martinsen, Petter Falkman. 2018). Business unit 1 has 100% critical functional testing for all completed assemblies and a review of the data shows most of the rejects come from this operation and the parts are automatically placed in a scrap bin. This eliminates the risk of shipping a non-conforming part of this type to the customer. These are also fully assembled parts at this point meaning they cost much more than a sub-assembly further skewing the data. Business meanwhile has a 100% visual inspection by experienced inspectors before the parts are packed and shipped. There is also the factor of human error and technological advancements for monitoring the data. Much of the scrap cost are a manual calculation based on scrap sheets filled out by the production operators and then input into a system that will calculate the cost based on where the part was in the process. This can lead to typos and missing information. Customer complaints are also tabulated manually by using the approved “LOG”. Some customer complaints may not get input. There has also been a large amount of turnover in the departments responsible for inputting all the data which can lead to missing information. If this study were to be completed again taking all these factors into account, then the result may look a lot different.","alexandr m. sokolov, ph.d., steven picklesimon, m.sc., duaa nawafleh, m.sc. and niamat ullah ibne hossain, ph.d. engineering management program arkansas state university state university, ar 72467, usa asokolov@astate.edu, steven.picklesi@smail.astate.edu, dnawafleh@astate.edu, nibnehossain@astate.edu",
244,Real-World Vehicle Emissions In Mexico,"real-world emissions are much higher in several parts of the world without evident reason. this work aims to investigate for those differences in mexico in the way that findings can be extrapolated to other countries. we identified three fields that have not been thoroughly covered in the literature: i) inspection and maintenance (i/m) programs, ii) air-conditioning systems (a/c), and iii) regional-based conditions such as fuel-quality, altitude, and model-year technologies. first, we must understand that i/m programs, which are absent in many countries, were created to identify highly polluting vehicles and force them to undergo mechanical maintenance. in this context, a methodology, based on a single measurement campaign using a remote-sensing device (rsd), is presented in this work to assess the reduction in vehicles emissions obtained from implementing i/m programs. as a case study, an rsd campaign was carried out in monterrey’s metropolitan area, mexico. approximately 0.4% of the vehicles registered in this region were sampled under similar conditions to those found in i/m programs. the results suggested that 39% of the vehicles would not comply with the current national regulations. following a conservative scenario, the implementation of a vehicle i/m program in this urban center has the potential of reducing the current mass emissions of hc, co and no in approximately 69%, 42% and 28%, respectively. second, to determine a/c impact on the real fuel consumption, light-duty passenger vehicles were monitored under their normal driving conditions in a 5-month campaign. we obtained, second-by-second, simultaneous measurements of the vehicle’s fuel consumption, speed, position, engine speed and load, and the a/c operational state (on/off). the results obtained showed that the added specific-fuel-consumption (sfc, l/100 km) due to the a/c peaked at low vehicle speeds (<10 km/h) with values up to 17.6 l/100 km. this increment reduces with vehicle speed, being (on average) 8.2 l/100 km for low speeds (<50 km/h) and 1.3 l/100 km for higher speeds. however, when observing this increment in terms of fuel consumption rate, those differences remained approximately constant at 0.9 l/h. results showed that the sfc metric is naturally influenced by the vehicle’s speed, hiding the real effect of the a/c fuel consumption. therefore, we suggested to report the a/c added fuel consumption using the fuel consumption rate metric, which showed no clear relationship with vehicle speed. additionally, we found that the a/c added load to the engine forces it to operate in regions of better efficiencies. and third, to identify the effect of regional based conditions, results from rsd measurements obtained in four different locations within mexico and the us were compared. results show that fuel formulation, altitude, and vehicle age were not significant factors in the mexico-us emissions discrepancy. it was mainly due to the notable presence of one outdated vehicle technology in mexico. in the mexico-city, this single vehicle technology raises the overall co, hc, and no emissions by 16%, 12%, and 29%, respectively.","remote sensing, i/m programs, air-conditioning",,"antonio e. mogro and josé ignacio huertas school of engineering and science tecnologico de monterrey monterrey, mexico a01366355@itesm.mx, jhuertas@tec.mx",

248,Pinning-Up Of Household Financial Behavior  To Support Financial System Stability In,"financial behavior is how individuals or households actually behave in a determination of financial behavior. how individuals or households make decisions about their financial behavior. financial system stability the financial system is one of the macro components that affects the stability of a country's economic financial system. this study is to see the effect of individual / household financial behavior on the stability of the financial system of 33 provinces in indonesia during 2013 to 2019. the data for this research is secondary data collected from several sources, namely the bank indonesia statistics bulletin, the central agency regional economic studies bulletin. statistics in various editions of the year of publication. the method used to analyze the data is the panel data regression method using the eviews 10 analysis tool. the purpose of this study is to determine the magnitude of the influence of financial behavior on the stability of the financial system in indonesia. the variables in financial behavior are the dimensions of financial financial inclusion as measured by the access dimension, namely the ratio of the number of bank offices to 100,000 population in 33 provinces, the dimensions of use, namely the number of msme loans to the total amount of credit in each province, savings and the percentage of poor people in 33 provinces in indonesia. financial system stability is measured from the grdp growth rate in 33 provinces in indonesia. the findings of this study are that access, use, savings, and poverty are able to explain the grdp as seen from the r-square value of 0.92, which means that all independent variables are able to explain the dependent variable while 8% is explained by variables outside the model. when people are able to access umkm credit available at formal financial institutions, it will increase the grdp, this can be seen from the msme credit value increasing by 1%, the pdrb will increase by 0.02%. the relationship between the percentage of poor people and the grdp also shows a significant relationship where if poverty is reduced by 1%, then grdp will increase by 9.5%.","savings, inflation, grdp, credit","Access, use, savings and poverty can explain GRDP as an indicator of financial system stability. GRDP growth increases profitability which in turn increases the stability of the financial system. This is because GRDP is associated with a general increase in the income of an economy. Of the four independent variables, only the access variable has no relationship with the increase in GRDP in 33 provinces in Indonesia. This is probably due to the fact that people access bank offices only to facilitate basic financial transactions instead of using the facility of having a bank account. The use of MSME credit and poverty reduction has a very significant effect on GRDP growth, while savings, although very influential, have not been able to increase GRDP growth in 33 provinces in Indonesia. The conclusion is that household financial behavior measured using the indicator number of bank offices per 100,000 population, the number of MSME loans to the total amount of credit in formal financial institutions, the amount of public savings, and the percentage of poor people have a significant relationship to financial system stability as measured by growth. GRDP of 33 provinces in Indonesia. The National Strategy for Financial Inclusion (SNKI) is a strategy for increasing capability in managing finances starting from increasing understanding and knowledge and public awareness of financial products and services. This of course requires appropriate policy support by both the government and Bank Indonesia in order to increase public access and be able to use financial services. The policies needed include a) policies to encourage the socialization of financial service products according to the needs of the community, b) formulate product schemes that are in accordance with the needs of the community, c) encourage changes in provisions while still paying attention to the principles of prudence proportionally, d) formulate regulations on distribution mechanisms aid funds through banking, e) strengthen the legal basis for improving consumer protection of financial services, and f) compile studies related to financial inclusion to determine policy direction in a sustainable manner.

250,Leveraging The Application Of Forecasting Methods To  Analyze The Scrap Data Of A Tire Industry,"forecasting methods are being used during the planning phase in different departments in several companies, helping managers on their decision-making process. the aim of this paper is to analyze which forecast method fits better for the scrap rate of a tire industry based on historical data analysis. the scrap rate is a very important key performance indicator for the observed company, having a high weight on strategic decisions. using past data, a comparison is made between trend-based methods: regression analysis and double exponential smoothing, and the currently in use by the company, a subjective method. by having a set kpi established for the tire scrap allows companies to allocate the proper funding and resources to this process. this also allows companies to have a standardized selection method on different factors that is accurate. in doing so there is no exact better or worse method to forecast the data however each company needs to evaluate which method is right for them.","forecast, scrap","According to Chambers et al. (1997), “The selection of a method depends on many factors—the context of the forecast, the relevance and availability of historical data, the degree of accuracy desirable, the time period to be forecast, the cost/ benefit (or value) of the forecast to the company, and the time available for making the analysis.” The company currently uses a method that is not a stablished one and even with higher errors than other methods compared on the paper, it’s not a forecast with a complete inaccuracy or irrational values, which shows how expert information can be very useful when forecasting. So, it is important to highlight that there’s no better or worse forecast method, there’s the most suitable one that will fit according to the company scenario, to the type of organization, to the current software’s available etc.","larissa guimaraes t. santanna, jessica lee, drew wright, niamat ullah ibne hossain, ph.d. mississippi state university mississippi state, ms 39762, usa lg1209@msstate.edu, jal840@msstate.edu, ajw637@msstate.edu, ni78@msstate.edu alexandr m. sokolov, ph.d. arkansas state university engineering management program arkansas state university state university, ar 72467, usa asokolov@astate.edu",

In fact, the figures in national reports do not express the reality of salaries in Mexico or the occupation of vacancies in companies, the reason being a certain degree of bias that occurs when reporting national figures, it may be because state agencies have sought to comply with the gender quota, however a real problem persists in terms women's access to leadership positions, there are limitations to enter the job market and advance in their career. This study could guide future research related to Mexico on gender equality and decent work, as the information is established in accordance with the sustainable development indicators of the 2030 agenda, specifically SDG 5 Gender Equality and SDG 8 Decent Work and Economic Growth. 6.1 Recommendations Due to the lack of analysis of other elements that can influence gender equality with respect to the workplace, it is recommended to expand the research considering more variables that influence women for the achievement of SDG 5 and SDG 8, such as cultural aspects, in different sectors. 6.2 Limitation Statistical information for conducting a more in-depth study is not available in the databases analyzed and the information available on the variables analyzed has a certain degree of bias.","brenda esmeralda moreno-garduño, gabriela guadalupe escobedo-guerrero, georgette del pilar pavía-gonzález, antonio uribe-méndez, victor martin maldonado-benitez esca santo tomás, instituto politécnico nacional, mexico city, mexico bmorenog1500@alumno.ipn.mx; gescobedog@ipn.mx; gabrielaeg@hotmail.com; gpaviag@ipn.mx; auribeme@ipn.mx; vmaldonadob1500@alumno.ipn.mx",

It is tested using a questionnaire that was delivered to 414 respondents in Bekasi City, spanning generation Z. The data is then examined using multiple linear regression with the statistical software Statistical Package for the Social Science (SPSS). The first objective of this research is to identify the factors that influence the Behavioral Intention (BI) to use the Mobile Payment among Generation Z in Bekasi city. This research would first develop five factors from the previous study that would potentially influence the customers’ Behavioral Intention in using mobile payment. Based on the previous study, the factors that would be identified would be Performance Expectancy, Effort Expectancy, Social Influence, Trust, and Perceived Security. The five factors then would become five hypotheses that would be analyzed by using the SPSS with Performance Expectancy as H1, Effort Expectancy as H2, Social Influence as H3, Trust as H4, and Perceived Security as H5. As interpreted from the questionnaire result as well as the analysis from the multiple linear regression by using the Statistical Package for the Social Science (SPSS), the factors that are identified to be significantly influence the behavioral intention of customers in using mobile payment are Social Influence and Perceived Security while the factors that have no significant relationship towards the Behavioral Intention are Performance Expectancy, Effort Expectancy and Trust. Therefore, this research accepted the hypotheses 3 and 5 (H3 and H5), while on the other hand rejected hypotheses 1, 2 and 4 (H1, H2 and H4). With that in mind, Social Influence and Perceived Security are influencing the Behavioral Intention to use mobile payment for Generation Z in Bekasi City. The next objective is to identify the most influential factor that influences the Behavioral Intention (BI) to use the Mobile Payment among Generation Z in Bekasi city. From the data that has been analyzed by the SPSS, in order to determine the most influential factors, the value that must be identified is the unstandardized beta values. In order for the factor to be most influential, the factor must have the unstandardized beta values that have the furthest value from zero. The unstandardized beta value can either be positive or negative. Based on the analysis from the SPSS, the unstandardized beta value of each factor would be as follows. Social Influence (0.086) and Perceived Security (0.112). Since the variable with the unstandardized beta values furthest from zero is required to find the most influential variables, the furthest unstandardized beta value from zero would be 0.112. Finally, the Perceived Security variable has the greatest influence.

260,Control And Continuous Improvement In The Picking Area,"an organization dedicated to logistics service as a supplier to the automotive sector. it is essential to implement strategies focused on cost reduction considering the needs of the industry. to identify the main areas of opportunity within the warehouse and to be able to propose an improvement that allows reducing costs and unnecessary movements in daily operations, an audit will be carried out, which is allow an analysis of all the areas involved. this article proposes an improvement in the operations of a warehouse belonging to the automotive sector. an audit was used to identify areas of opportunity within the warehouse. the audit results showed that the picking area is 74% effective due to the downtime generated on tour when supplying an order. therefore, the implementation of the dual cycle allocation method is presented to improve performance and reduce costs through the optimization of travel distances. the implementation of kpis is proposed to measure and control the procedures related to picking.","warehouse, kpis, picking area, mexico","The investigation of this type of practical case turns out to be very useful for graduate students and workers of organizations because useful tools are implemented and developed in the management of the supply chain, which serves to face problems that arise daily in the workplace. The solution to these problems results in a continuous improvement in its operations and an economic benefit in reducing costs. This project is presented to the organization as a proposal for implementing the suggested project to the client's needs for the automatic taking of sets, specifically for the picking area. It is important to constantly and periodically monitor and monitor the performance of the activities carried out within the warehouse. The implementation of KPIs for the picking area helps to detect errors and/or areas of opportunity, generating a strategy to solve the errors detected. With this, it is expected to have greater control in the operations of the warehouse, reducing mistakes and encouraging continuous improvement. Another aspect that must be evaluated is the stock levels, taking into account the capacity to store material, since the stock levels proportionally affect the complexity of the picking, increasing the distance to be traveled. That is why it is essential to organize the layout of the warehouse and the optimization of routes.

262,A Comparative Life Cycle Assessment Study Of  Conventional And Best Available Techniques Incorporated,"the construction industry is responsible for several environmental impacts because of various industrial activities. quantifying these impacts is a major roadmap to reducing them. this study carried out a comparative life cycle assessment (lca) on two cement plants using the midpoint (problem-oriented approach): cementos cosmos s.a. spanish cement plant (with best available techniques reference document –bref- incorporation) and a typical european plant to quantify the environmental impacts’ gains in cement production. the analysis was based on the functional unit of 1ton of cement produced in each plant, and the lca software used was simapro 8.2. the result of the analysis showed that the impact categories from cementos cosmos s.a. plant had significant reduction when compared with the impact categories from european plant analysis. however, ozone depletion increased by 5% as a result of high quantity of petroleum coke used in cementos cosmos s.a. plant. also, climate change has not a great reduction, this is also due to high amount of limestone used in the production process of the cement plant; these however influenced the entire result of the analysis. these results show that the bref recommendations are very effective as there is great improvement in the environmental performance however, further reduction of fossil fuels (petcoke) and limestone should be considered.","midpoint, cement, lca, lcia","It was carried out a comparative life cycle assessment study on two cement plants: Cementos Cosmos S.A. cement plant and a typical European plant using mid-point (problem-oriented) approach of LCIA method. Cementos Cosmos S.A. plant located in Spain has incorporated some BREF recommendations into her production processes. These recommendations are use of alternative fuel, use of waste as fuel, reduction of the use of fossil fuel (coal), reduction of the quantity of clinker used in cement production, partial replacement of clinker with alternative materials. The characterization result of both plants was compared, and the result showed that all impact categories from the Cementos Cosmos S.A. plant reduced greatly except for ozone depletion, which increased by 5%. Tracing back to the LCI analysis, petroleum coke has the highest impact of all the fossil fuel used. The amount of petroleum coke used in the Cementos Cosmos S.A. plant is higher than the value used in the European cement plant, hence the increase. Most of the impact categories with significant reduction were associated with two major production processes: raw material consumption and fuel consumption. These two processes involve mining and extraction of resources as well as the processing of these resources. Therefore, this reduction is due to a reduction in the resources mined and extracted, compared to the resources used in a typical European plant. This shows that the use of alternative fuel and material, waste, reduction of coal thus reduces the environmental impact of a cement production process. Climate change also has 21% reduction. From the LCI analysis, it was observed that a higher quantity of limestone was used in the production of clinker. Hence significant reduction was not experienced though the quantity of clinker used was reduced. Further analysis was carried out on the top four impact categories with the highest value in both plants. These impacts are climate change, human toxicity, ionizing radiation and fossil depletion. Comparative analysis between both plants showed that when the above-listed BREF recommendations are incorporated into the production process, there is a reduction of about 0.175t of CO2 emitted into the atmosphere for every 1 ton of cement produced. Also, there is a reduction of about 0.0323t manganese emitted into the waterbody for every 1 ton of cement produced. In addition, there is a reduction of about 4.6kBq of radon-222 and 0.3 kBq of carbon-14 emitted into the atmosphere for every 1 ton of cement produced. Finally, there is a reduction of about 0.0236t of coal in terms of coal extraction for every 1 ton of cement produced. However, crude oil usage increases by 0.0064t; this is due to more petroleum coke used in the production process of Cementos Cosmos S.A. plant. The midpoint normalized values of both plants showed that the major impact categories in Cementos Cosmos S.A. are: Natural land transformation, Climate change, Marine ecotoxicity, Freshwater eutrophication, Freshwater ecotoxicity, Human toxicity and Fossil depletion, while those of European cement plant are Natural land transformation, Marine ecotoxicity, Freshwater eutrophication, Freshwater ecotoxicity, Human toxicity, Climate change, and Fossil depletion. The production processes with the highest contribution to these impacts are clinker production, fossil fuel consumption, and raw material consumption. The results in this study are compatible with those in the literature with minimal variation.

263,Determination Of Heat Transfer Coefficient In Heat  Treatment Processes Using Computational Fluid Dynamics,"heat treatment is the most common method to modify the mechanical properties in steel automotive workpieces, through heating and cooling processes. depending of the heat treatment or stage we can have different values of heat transfer coefficient (htc). for the thermometallurgical calculations, the most important boundary condition is the htc, which can be obtained by a trial-and-error approach, inverse mathematical techniques, or computational fluid dynamics. in this paper the application of computational fluid dynamics (cfd) in the calculation of the htc values for natural convection phenomena was used. these measurements were obtained in austenitizing stage, annealing, normalizing and quenching processes, the specimen was a structural steel channel beam. the simulation was developed in ansys fluent. the incompressible-ideal gas model was used for the buoyancy effect generated by the internal heat source in the flow field. the two-equation k-ω based sst (shear stress transport) turbulence model was used to mould the turbulent stresses in the reynolds-average navier-stokes equations (rans). the results demonstrated that cfd simulation is a powerful tool to calculate htc in transitory states. the feasibility and precision of cfd calculations in each external fluid condition was demonstrated. a good correlation between the gotten results and similar previous works in the literature was confirmed.","htc, cfd, natural convection",,"simulation juan barbosa and arturo aranda manufacturing process simulation department driven / claut innovation center monterrey, nl 66628, mexico jbarbosa@drivencenter.com, aaranda@drivencenter.com",
264,On The Assessment Of Neutral Theory Via Applying Maxent  To The Analysis Of Barro Colorado Island,"this paper follows upon the maximum entropy (maxent)-inspired ecophysical formulations of s. azaele et al. and a. r. rominger by constructing a computational model in conjunction with ecosystem recovery assessment models to construct physical hypothesis and computational trajectories of the barro colorado island (bci) based upon tree species abundance data collected by c. richard et al. through the development of quantitative methods for predicting the dynamics of multispecies communities of trees in tropical forests inspired by the bci study area, a broad array of questions of particular importance to tropical systems—such as those pertaining to mechanisms responsible for large- scale patterns of species abundance and distribution, species coexistence, and the maintenance of vast species diver- sity—can be addressed, with this paper placing particular emphasis on implications relevant to those surrounding the neutral theory of molecular evolution.","ecophysics, maxent","Thus, the tree species composition of the BCI forest is not stable and changing for reasons not yet entirely under- stood (R. Condit et al. 2019). However, we can predict these changes as a result of self-regulation. We have shown that most of the trajectories of the 20 most abundant species are well described by logistic difference equations with parameters estimated by species forecasting techniques. This makes us confident in the proposed method to predict the future abundances of these species. Through the Lotka-Volterra equations, the significance of interspecific com- petition was assessed, ultimately determined to be mostly negligible relative to intraspecific competition, which vali- dates that initial assumption. Moreover, we found the estimated species parameters, 𝑟𝑟𝑖𝑖 and 𝒦𝒦𝑖𝑖, vary strongly from one species to another. Ac- cording to the dispersal-assembly hypothesis, which assumes that communities are open non-equilibrium assem- blages of species that coexist only transiently through by chance, history, and random dispersal rather than by the stabilizing effects of niche differentiation, regarded as negligible (S. C. Thomas 2003), there are no important differ- ences between species. Thus, the findings of this research contradict this neutrality, in agreement with large ecologi- cal differences found among tree species in tropical forests indicating that the central assumption of neutral theory that species are equivalent is simply incorrect (S. Hubbell 2008). Exact numerical predictions for the year of 2020 were determined, with overall mean relative errors of 22.1 and 13.7 for the quadrats of side length 𝐿𝐿= 20m and 𝐿𝐿= 10m, respectively, indicating considerable accuracy for the 𝑇𝑇𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡= 4 analysis. C. Richard et al. is yet to such data, but it is likely conclusions pertaining to the neutral theory of evolution for older data will remain valid.

271,The Stakeholders’ Perceptions On Critical Success Factors  For Construction Projects,"critical success factors are those limited areas where “things must go right” for a business or organization to survive. they are described as performance measures which are crucial in making certain that a successful project is implemented and closed out in organizations. various authors in literature have highlighted what they deem as the most important success factors for project execution, and these have been filtered out to capture the most relevant ones to the built environment industry, being: time, cost, quality, and scope and risk management. quality is not only one of the three dimensions of the project management triangle, but also considered the ultimate, for every delivery depends on it. project stakeholders are those individuals that have a direct or indirect effect on the success or failure of a project and have varying opinions of what constitutes as a successful project. the listed success factors above will be discussed on this paper in accordance to how the most important construction project stakeholders view those specified factors. the purpose of this research article is to investigate, assess and determine the critical success factors in construction projects and to validate their impact on the views of construction project stakeholders.","stakeholders, therefore","It has been determined under the literature review that projects are endeavors undertaken to attain goals compliant to deliverables of organizations by performing certain functions over a certain period. Project success entails meeting the requirement of project members. A connection exists between success factors and project success. Project success factors are tools that can be utilized to boost the successful implementation of a project. From the research findings, it was deduced that all the critical success factors (time, cost, quality, risk, and scope) identified on the literature review were considered critical to the success of a construction project, with differing weighting scales as to the reasons most and least affecting those success factors The purpose of identifying stakeholders in projects is to reduce the number of actions that might be taken by stakeholders to hamper projects in any negative way. Stakeholders are those people that depend on the project to be successful to realize their own objectives and the project also depends on them for it to be a success. Projects comprise of internal and external stakeholders who can be categorized as neutral, uninvolved, flexible, difficult, risky, or decisive. According to the literature review, the internal stakeholders comprising of the owner, project manager, design team, main contractor and end-users can be viewed as relevant stakeholders in construction projects. The first objective of the research was for project managers to understand the critical factors required to ensure project success. The critical success factors were researched, discussed, and listed in the order of ranking from the most important to the least. This is intended to help project managers in ensuring that producing a quality project is seen as the most important factor in any project, followed by adhering to project time frames, then keeping to the budget, managing the risks, and ensuring that there is no scope creep. The second objective was to understand how stakeholders perceive these success factors in construction projects. The aim of this research was to also identify the most important stakeholders in construction projects and to determine how the critical success factors impact their views on project success.

By using these audio, video and textual data we can equip the ML model without any need of expensive clinical equipment. Furthermore we can incorporate the above mentioned data with other mobile sensor data and online activities we can improve the accuracy of the models. Furthermore we can use the discussed method to detect mental disorders at an early stage for industrial workers and employees so that we can prevent any accidents or the loss of productivity. 5. Future plans By incorporating these multimodal data features together we can build a ML model with better accuracy. Along with audio, video and text features, other features such as online activities such as the online surfing content, social media activities, sensor data, GPS data and other mobile sensor data to properly incorporate them by giving each feature proper weightage and training a ML model based on that data. We believe that amalgamation of various data features with proper weightage will be helpful in attaining much better accuracy. We’ll continue this study so that we can ultimately develop an all-purpose mental illness detection model based on above mentioned data. 6.

276,Identification Of External Risks Affecting The South African  Mining Sector And Their Mitigation Strategies,"the mining sector plays a huge role in building the economy of different countries. the contribution of the mining industry to the gross domestic product in south africa has declined over the years due to different challenges such as risks and uncertainties. the main purpose of the study was to identify the external risks affecting the mining industry in south africa and their mitigation strategies. a total of 21 mines from 6 south african provinces were covered. the commodities covered in the study include gold, platinum, coal, copper, iron ore, and diamond. the external risks affecting mines globally that were identified from the literature review include fluctuation of commodity prices risk, volatility of exchange rates risk, political risk, environmental risk, health risk and pandemics risk. the survey used in the study revealed that south african mines are also faced with similar risks. some more risks affecting south african mining that were identified through the questionnaire include illegal mining, attracting and retaining skilled labour, cyber-attacks, socio-economic challenges, load shedding and hiv/aids. the results revealed that most mining companies apply similar mitigation strategies such as hedging and insurance to combat the external risks.","external risk, mining sector","The external risks affecting mines globally that were identified from the literature review include fluctuation of commodity prices, volatility of exchange rates, political risks, environmental risk, health risk and pandemic risks. The survey which used the external risks identified globally as a basis of identifying external risks in South Africa revealed that South African mines are also faced with similar risks. Some more risks affecting South African mining that were identified through the questionnaire include illegal mining, high competition and decrease in global demand, attracting and retaining skilled labour, cyber-attacks, socio-economic challenges, load shedding, HIV/AIDS, contractor labour unrests and divestment impediments. It was deduced from the study that there is no particular correlation between the risks. Certain external risks such as fluctuation of commodity prices affect all mining operations, locally and globally and will always be there as long as the mines are operating and trading. Certain external risks affect operations depending on the geographical location of an operation, a country’s governance, and type of commodities mined, while other external risks affect operations randomly. When these risks strike in different operations, the outcomes are mostly different as they depend on how the specific risks were handled. Although operations apply different mitigation strategies to combat the risks, certain strategies are popular within operations such as the hedging strategy for risks such as fluctuation of commodity prices and strategies such as insurance for environmental and political risks. It was also revealed that most operations use many different strategies, either simultaneously or one at a time depending on the state of the organization then. The impacts of external risks on operations listed by participants include: loss of production, high production costs, loss of mining rights, damage to mine properties and elevated social instability, while the impacts of external risks on employees include retrenchments, loss of lives and loss of other beneficial work incentives. 80% of all the participants mentioned the loss of jobs or retrenchments as the main impact on employees. This is of high concern, especially in a country like South Africa with a high unemployment rate and high levels of poverty. The research also revealed that poor countries or poor and marginalized communities get impacted more by the consequences of uncertainties that were not planned for as compared to countries with enough resources.","moshopyadi pretty mashamba and hannelie nel post-graduate school of engineering management faculty of engineering and the built environment university of johannesburg johannesburg, south africa moshopyadipretty@gmail.com, hannelien@uj.ac.za",
277,Analyzing The Potential Of Technology In Sri Lanka To Adopt  Evoting: A Systematic Literature Review,"in this digital era, technology plays a vital role in our day-to-day life. technologies reduce human errors. evidence shows that many of the countries moved to e-voting systems from a traditional pen and paper-based system. for fair and efficient elections. e-voting means allowing voters to cast their votes through websites or electronic voting machines. sri lanka is a south asian democratic country. in sri lanka, the traditional pen and paper-based methods are used for election process currently. since e-voting has more advantages than the traditional election system such as e-voting is more efficient and secure and cost-effective. although implementing e-voting technologies will expose how internal technologies are developed by a country. this study addressed the technology capability in sri lanka to implement an e-voting technology. a broad systematic literature review has been done to identify how other countries such as india, brazil, estonia, switzerland have implemented e-voting technologies. and what are technologies have been used to implement. some critical factors need to be considered when implementing e-voting such as security, environment, integrity, perceived ease of use, and perceived benefits are identified as an extension of the tam model through a systematic literature review.","e- voting, e-voting benefits","E-voting adoption is a proactive area. Many studies have been conducted worldwide in this area and its technology; Many countries moved to E-voting for efficient elections, and they have used various new technologies. These E- voting technologies are updated year by year. Sri Lanka is a developing country, has the potential to adopt new technologies Sri Lankan internet penetration level and computer literacy rate is increasing every year but In Sri Lanka Pen and paper-based elections method is still in Action. E-voting has many advantages over pen and paper election systems such as being cost-effective, secure, and efficient. so above study talked about Sri Lankan technology potential level and E-voting Advantages and how other countries have implemented E-voting and what are the technologies they used and what are the technologies that can be used in future and what are the critical factors that need to be considered when thinking to adopt E-voting such as Security, Perceived Ease of use, Perceived benefits and integrity, Environment.

278,The Cultural Dimension Of Entrepreneurial Leaders In,"cultural diversity has many shapes and different values in every part of the world. indeed, cultural differences influence perceptions and behaviors. in the field of entrepreneurship, culture has a significant role in creating successful business launches and certain conditions. entrepreneurial leaders that have already survived during the first step in building their new venture certainly have a specific attitude that fits the local culture of their employees. this study examined the specific attitude of young entrepreneurs in sundanese society by using thematic content analysis to formulate cultural dimension. the data were gathered by using in-depth interviews with three fresh graduate entrepreneurs, who have built their businesses during their last 3 to 5 years of studies at the west java business university. the respondents were selected purposively according to certain considerations, such as their good business prospects. to help the analysis process, nvivo was used to code the interview transcripts. the results showed that several attitudes of the entrepreneurial leaders could thematically cluster around the sundanese dimensions, such as silih asah, silih asih, and silih asuh. this study offers authentic values of the sundanese dimensions of entrepreneurial leaders which have not been researched before by using the thematic analysis method. it also contributes to cultural leadership and entrepreneurial leadership research by providing a specific cultural perspective that might have differed if implemented in other countries or regions.",cultural values,"This study has analyzed the entrepreneurial leadership behavior values of entrepreneurial small business owners by using the Sundanese values framework. Data are processed in a series of steps. The analysis begins with descriptive coding, where data are organized into meaningful groups. The emerging groups are then refined through successive stages of interpretive coding to identify overarching themes. The primary tool used for data coding is the NVIVO software package. Based on the focus group discussion, several Sundanese values are found in the entrepreneurial leaders’ daily attitude and behavior. The results show that culture influences entrepreneurial leaders’ behavior. Besides, several values of entrepreneurial leaders are relevant to Sundanese values. The perspective of entrepreneurial leaders for certain behavior requirements are attributed to the dimension of Sundanese values. These values are deemed essential for leaders in entrepreneurial firms. In addition, several attitudes of the entrepreneurial leaders could thematically cluster around the Sundanese dimension, such as silih asah, silih asih, and silih asuh. This study offers authentic values of the Sundanese dimensions of entrepreneurial leaders which have not been research before by using the thematic analysis method. It also contributes to cultural leadership and entrepreneurial leadership research by providing a specific cultural perspectives that might have differed if implemented in other countries or regions.","mulyani karmagatri* entrepreneurship department, binus business school undergraduate program bina nusantara university, jakarta, indonesia 11480 mulyani001@binus.ac.id hazmilah hasan faculty of technology management and technopreneurship universiti teknikal malaysia melaka hazmilah@utem.edu.my andreas chang entrepreneurship department, binus business school undergraduate program bina nusantara university, jakarta, indonesia 11480 achang@binus.edu",
279,Investigation Of The Effectiveness Of Erp System On  Management Decision-Making In Higher Educational,"a survey of literature regarding erp system supports for management decision-making in organizations revealed contrary views. according to some researchers, erp systems only integrate business processes and functions and bring about efficiency in organizations. from various literature reviews, it is clear that there is an ambiguity in erp systems effectiveness to support management decision-making. research on erp systems effectiveness impact on management decision-making in heis is rare. therefore, this study seeks to investigate this phenomenon by adopting a framework of peters and aggrey to evaluate the influence of erp systems effectiveness on management decision-making in heis. using relevant theoretical foundations, a research model was developed to test five relevant hypotheses. using quantitative research, data were collected from 150 administrators and managers of three case study universities in ghana. data was analyzed using pls-sem andthe findings revealed that erp systems effectiveness based on these perspectives (financial, learning and growth, customer/stakeholder and system quality) influence more significantly on management decision–making in heis unlike internal business process perspective. the findings backed the idea that, erp systems supports and improve management decision-making. the findings also support the research model proposed.","erp systems, erp effectiveness, balanced scorecard",,"institutions george k. aggrey department of computer science and information technology university of cape coast, ghana gaggrey@ucc.edu.gh amevi acakpovi department of electrical and electronic engineering accra technical university (atu), ghana aacakpovi@atu.edu.gh emmanuel peters department of computer science and information technology accra institute of technology (ait), ghana peterse30@gmail.com","References

280,Erp Implementation Challenges In Ghanaian Higher  Education Institution,"enterprise resource planning (erp) systems implementation is increasing rapidly in the higher education institutions, because of the call by various governments on them to streamline processes and functions. however, not all erp implementations have been successful. there are still challenges in the implementations of erp especially in the higher education sector. since erp implementation comes with high cost and also affects every aspect of the institution, there is therefore the need of investigating the challenges of erp implementation in heis. the study focuses on erp implementation challenges in the ghanaian higher education. using a case study research, data for analysis were collected from some public universities in ghana and were analyzed using inductive thematic analysis. the findings of the study revealed three categories of challenges: institutional related challenges, financial related challenges and human related challenges, were some of the challenges encountered when implementing erp systems in the ghanaian higher education. it is expected that the findings of this study would provide valuable information not only to practitioners but also to academics. the findings will serve as source of general guidance in stimulating future research in this area. understanding these challenges will assist heis to eliminate or mitigate erp implementation failures.","erp systems, implementation, challenges","In conclusion, we recall the study’s research objective, research question and research findings. The research objective is to investigate the challenges of ERP implementation in higher education institutions (HEIs) and this led to the research question “what are the challenges of ERP systems implementation in higher education institutions”. The findings of the study revealed three main categories of challenges namely: institutional/organizational related challenges (low level of IT/IS maturity and internal business process incompatibility), financial related challenge (high cost of ERP project implementation) and human related challenges (staffs resistance to the system, staffs lack of commitments or involvements, lack of top managements involvement or commitments and training of staffs to use the system). The research findings practically suggest that the HEIs management and other stakeholders should consider critically these challenges when implementing ERP systems in order to avoid high failure rate. Our study’s finding informs the HEI management and stakeholders especially the academia and practitioners on issues concerning ERP implementation challenges. It also informs ERP system vendors, ERP developers and other supporting ERP services on the need to consider these challenges when making decisions about ERP implementations in the HEI.

281,A Collaborative Iot Design Approach,"internet of things (iot) is a rapidly growing field with applications in many industries. yet, companies still experience difficulties in selecting and developing effective and efficient iot solutions that add value. this study provides a case within the automotive industry, i.e. an automotive parts manufacturer, called apm. in this case, we highlight the need for an efficient iot solution for apm and we suggest that a systematic and collaborative approach, called action design research (adr), is used for selecting, co-developing, implementing and testing an iot solution. although apm experimented with an iot solution before, the solution was inadequate and failed to address the efficiency problems. as the main contribution, we present a collaborative iot design approach (ciotda) to guide practitioners in developing and implementing iot solutions. in addition, we provide experimental results for a partial implementation of ciotda. the availability recorded by the sensors was an average of 3.7% lower than the availability from the log sheets, where the largest difference was 7.6%. the total number of parts produced was mostly consistent except for one cell that logged 90 parts produced while the sensor only recorded 51 parts.","internet of things, barnes, black","In summary, this article suggested a new collaborative IoT design approach (CIOTDA) that should be useful to other manufacturing enterprises that need to improve the quality of their manufacturing processes using IoT technology. We addressed three research objectives in this study. Addressing our first objective, we selected appropriate industrial engineering techniques to construct a collaborative IoT design approach (CIOTDA). Our survey-results confirmed the collaborative nature of CIOTDA. As a second objective, we applied the CIOTDA at a real-world enterprise, partially demonstrating its application in this article. Our initial implementation results confirm that the IoT solution has the potential to increase the efficiency of data collection and management’s ability to effectively monitor manufacturing operations. As a third objective, we presented some experimental results to demonstrate how the sensor data becomes useful to identify trends or downtime, prompting management action. The CIOTDA was developed using action design research (ADR), demonstrating the artefact at a single enterprise. Based on some of the feedback (from our survey results), the CIOTDA could be further improved to ensure that a more comprehensive set of requirements are gathered for the IoT solution. As indicated by the fourth stage of an ADR study, further evolution of the artefact is needed. The CIOTDA should also be demonstrated at other manufacturing enterprises to further validate its usefulness.","maxwell schoeman and marné de vries department of industrial engineering university of pretoria south africa maxwell.schoeman@tuks.co.za, marne.devries@up.ac.za",
282,The Impact Of Destination Attributes To Traveling Decision  In New Normal,"after surviving the covid-19 epidemic, civilization must eventually adjust to a new normal. currently, certain situations are unpredictable and cannot be anticipated or projected based on previous historical data. after enduring the lengthy quarantine and the tremendous mental stress brought on by the complicated circumstances, the priority for most individuals is to take vacations. traveling to various locations that provide a variety of holiday experiences becomes a viable option to selecting. what attribute of a destination has become more important to individuals when they decide to travel? this study investigates the significance of destination attributes to travel decisions in the new normal. in this study, regression is used to analyze data collected randomly from 150 respondents. the study's results indicate that the primary factor influencing a visitor's choice to go or not is activities. the findings of this research will aid the tourism sector in developing strategies for visitor-oriented activities. another critical advantage is recognizing that customer behavior directly impacts a company's long-term success.",traveling decision,"Health, economics, and the environment are all affected by the COVID19. Tourism is one of the worst-hit industries during the covid-19 Era. Since tourism activities can improve mental health and well-being, therefore people are still searching the tourism destination without neglecting the covid-19 health protocol. During the outbreak, people are more likely to stay in their own city, and large families with young children are more likely to travel short distances than other groups of tourists. The COVID-19 pandemic is still ongoing, but the tourism industry is expected to recover. Based on the phenomena that occur, a study related to travel decision is carried out on consumer behavior of the visitor in the new normal. With the opening of several tourist attractions in the new normal, several factors will be considered by visitors to be able to make travel decision, including destination attributes. A quantitative study was carried out where the results of the study found activity, accessibility and ancillary service had significant relation to travel decision. It is immediately known that activity became the first consideration to travel decision, tourism management appears to prioritize visitors ‘activity in tourism area, outdoor activities can be a consideration for management to provide for visitors, by always maintaining the number of visitors and health protocols. Second attribute that affected travel decision was accessibility, it indicated that visitors was still confidence with the transportation to get the tourism destination. The study also showed that the most visitors still choose tourist destination in the city during the pandemic. Ancillary service was the last appealing indicators to visitors. It indicated that visitors really believe that the management has followed all the health protocol requirements as an effort to keep visitors from covid 19.

283,Supply Chain Inventory Optimization: An Alternative  Approach,"in this paper, an alternative approach is proposed to deal with the inventory positioning problem in a supply chain network. in particular, the problem is modelled as a mixed integer programming model. in this model, the locations and amount of stock at each location are decision variables, while the total holding inventory cost is the objective function. the optimal solution for such a model can be obtained by using a commercial. the applicability of the proposed method, especially the mathematical model, is validated by a few numerical experiments. the results indicates that our approach is suitable for various types of supply chain networks and the optimal solutions for these networks are easily obtained via a commercial solver.","inventory placement, base stock policy, stochastic demand","In this paper, an alternative approach for modelling a supply chain inventory positioning (IP) problem is introduced. Conventionally, the problem is formulated as non-linear mathematical model. Solving this type of model involves the development of complex algorithm. The implementation of such an algorithm is also a challenge. As an attempt to overcome this difficulty, the IP problem is constructed as mixed-integer linear programming model. The solution for this kind model is obtained by using a commercial solver. Indeed, this is demonstrated by a numerical study, in which the inventory position problem is solved for an assembly and a serial supply chain. In addition to illustrating the ease of having an optimal solution, the numerical study highlights the flexibility of our approach to model different structures of a supply chain network.

284,Medical Surge Capability: An Intelligent Framework For,"health systems are faced with significant challenges during and after natural or human-caused disasters. surge planning is a critical component of every healthcare facility’s emergency plan and response system. the process of managing and allocating scarce resources by tackling the vulnerability inherent to patients means that defining improvement priorities is one of the main challenges healthcare systems face when responding to a medical surge event (e.g., influenza, covid-19). the consequences of these challenges include increased patient mortality, ambulance diversion, long wait times, and unavailability of beds. although previous efforts in hospital operations management have been modestly successful in applying operations research techniques to analyze and optimize ed operations during a standard operating capacity and, literature provides a vast number of resources on surge response planning for hospital administrators, most of the planning guidelines are not suitable for the current pandemic scale. this project aims to develop computational models that help to answer how the constant level of hospital resources and the changing demand for medical care can be modeled. we propose an intelligent framework to improve ed operations following a four-stage process. stage one – develop univariate and multivariate forecasting models to forecast daily ed patient arrivals, which will help hospital management efficiently plan and allocate limited ed resources. stage two – investigate the current prolonged ed length of stay for covid-19 patients, using ensemble methods. stage three – developing a multi-scale simulation-optimization framework to investigate how resource allocation affects the ed’s performance during a surge. the simulation model combines agent-based, discrete event, and system dynamics, where system dynamics address the spread of disease, agent-based models the behavior of patients and resources (i.e., doctors and nurses), and discrete event models the processes within the hospital emergency departments. the expected outcomes of the study are the multi-objective combination of indicators to optimize ed performance and studying the interactions between the different ed operations to improve service capacity. our proposed activity will assist hospital administrators, and clinicians plan effectively to ramp up capacity in response to the current and future pandemic. proceedings of the international conference on industrial engineering and operations management monterrey, mexico, november 3-5, 2021 © ieom society international 2363",,,"egbe-etu etu, phd department of marketing and business analytics san jose state university san jose, ca 95192, usa egbe-etu.etu@sjsu.edu leslie monplaisir, phd, celestine aguwa, phd, sara masoud, phd department of industrial & systems engineering wayne state university detroit, mi 48202, usa suzan arslanturk, phd department of computer science wayne state university detroit, mi 48202, usa joseph miller, md department of emergency medicine henry ford hospital detroit, mi 48202, usa",
285,"A Framework To Foster Innovation-Driven Enterprises  Creation In The University, The Case Of Monterrey Region In","emerging countries face a series of challenges on their agenda, one of them being the socio-economic development of their region. one well-known way to create a competitive economy is by introducing innovative technologies, products, or services. entrepreneurship can be classified into small and medium enterprises and innovation-driven enterprises (ide). three main actors can boost ide's creation by looking at the triple helix model: industry, government, and the university. in this research, the university plays the leading role in promoting the creation of these companies. conceiving a new company by transferring technology from an academic institution is known as a university spin-off. however, this practice has not been studied in depth in emerging countries. therefore, this research focuses on shedding some light on how the entrepreneurial university can foster the creation of these companies. the steps in this process were (i) identifying the significant elements for the creation of innovation-driven companies with a literature review and a validation of the elements with the fuzzy delphi method, (ii) modeling the current process of spin-off creation in two universities in the monterrey region using the total interpretive structural modeling tool, (iii) and analyzing the current situation in the region to show key points in the creation of policies to support university decision-makers. the results show the current process of the two largest universities in the region, one private and one public, from which key points can be extracted. similar aspects are the relevance of the entrepreneurial vision of the university and the applied research in the following stages of the process. also, the high influence the context has on the applied research carried out by the universities. a third common aspect was that the technology transfer strategy mechanism was the first entity receiving the applied research and defined whether the project could be commercialized via university spin-offs. if so, it was transferred to the support mechanisms for the creation and development of the company, for example, incubators and accelerators, among others. moreover, access to capital was exhibited as an opportunity for both universities, wherein the private university, this element was not found in the system, and for the public university, the manner of accessing these financial resources was through funds that supported research and development activities, being a conflict in the creation of a company because it is non-profit capital. a call for the region was the lack of culture towards technology commercialization; in both universities, it was not yet strong enough to drive the system, and it appears to be in the shaping stage. in this way, the foundations were laid with this research, for the entrepreneurial university in an emerging country to understand their technology transfer channels, and to adapt them to their context.","university spin-off, mexico",,"mexico. alejandro téllez girón barrera and david güemes castorena school of engineering and sciences tecnologico de monterrey monterrey, nl 64849, mex tgbalejandro@gmail.com, guemes@tec.mx",
286,Dimensionality Reduction And Text Mining For Smart  Content Filtering Of An Online Health Forum,"the use of social media platforms has become choice for individuals searching for health-related information on the web. in this study, we consider news aggregation and discussion internet forum, reddit, for its unique characteristics. correspondence analysis is employed as a dimensionality reduction and knowledge representation technique for the text analytics of reddit posts. we present a case study of comments and posts for information retrieval, creating visual representations of interrelated groups of words and topics. these representations may be used for smart navigation systems, promoting discussion, transparency, and support pertaining to social determinants and healthcare among users on social media platforms and within online communities.","clustering, social media","Text mining of knowledge representation can play a fundamental role in supporting the exchange of experiences related to health outcomes and conditions on online platforms. Providing methods which enhance the control users have over their content exposure on social media platforms and online forums is essential in improving the facilitation of these exchanges. In this article we show that the dual representation of words and posts used in a sub-reddit allows for intelligent and cohesive groupings of information relevant to the unique interests of users, and that the representations can serve as a tool for smart navigation and web searching in an online forum. Furthermore, by incorporating text data from sub-reddits that may be interrelated, such as r/PregnancyAfterLoss/, an extension of these ideas can be used to study the behavioral patterns and social interactions within multi- community platforms. From this, it is possible that related posts and information could be mapped to groupings considered in this work, developing a navigation network for users based on their interests and the information that is pertinent to them.

This research aims to select an optimal recycling mode of express package and provide suggestion for Yunnan University to implement express garbage recycling. First, the the factors which impact the express package recycling were extracted through literature review. Then, the questionnaire is sent to experts of reserve logistics management to assess the importance of each factor for making the pairwise comparison matrix. Then, the AHP model is computed. As the result, the weight of Cainiao Courier station recycle mode is 0.83 while another is accounted for 0.15. This significant result express that he recycling method of Cainiao station is more preferable with consumers. 6.2 Study the factors which affect the current packaging recycling development in campus Recycling factors can be divided into subjective factors and objective factors. Subjective factors can be understood as the recycling factors influenced by subjective reasons of consumers, such as consumers' recycling awareness and the convenience of package recycling. Objective factors refer to the recycling factors influenced by the behaviour of external subjects such as the government and enterprises, such as recycling cost, package standards, incentive policies, recycling channels, and intelligent management. After getting these seven factors, in the next step the researcher established the AHP model and design the questionnaire based on all the factors that impact package recycling. 6.3 Select the best candidate of Yunnan university recycling mode through AHP method. The researcher collected data by sending questionnaires to experts, designed pairwise comparison matrix by analysing data with mean value method, and then designed AHP model.

292,Modeling And Algorithm Design For Driver Assignment  Problems Considering Drivers States And Capacity,"this paper aims to model a driver assignment problem which considers drivers states and capacity. the problem can be classified as a capacitated vehicle routing problem (cvrp). in the current literature, cvrp is a topic which has the most papers devoted to solving the problem. in this research, a comprehensive cost function is considered, and the driver can always have sufficient amount goods to deliver, and the variety of drivers is enlarged. these three factors are the improvement of the cvrp when compared to the state-of-the art research. we develop a mathematical model using linear programming approach. the complexity of the models makes the analytical solution is difficult to solve the problem. we develop a modified version of genetic algorithm to suit the problem in this research. we apply the model and algorithm to a e-commerce delivery problem of agricultural products. based on a simulation from an actual dataset, the objective function from the algorithm differs 1.15% from the global optimal solution, which give the algorithm a promising future to be applied in other sets of problem.","cvrp, genetics algorithm, sweep algorithm","In this study, the development of models and algorithms for the problem of assigning drivers to delivery of agricultural products has been carried out. The mathematical model developed has been verified and validated. The algorithm is tested with a dataset resembling the original dataset. Compared to manual assignment, the assignment speed is faster (manual assignment has a speed of 0.0833 customers/sec). The algorithm has been verified and validated and provides a feasible solution and at a faster speed than the initial conditions. One of the suggestions that can be given to the company is to improve the accuracy of the longitude and latitude coordinates of the customer. One way that might be used is to ask the customer to place a point on a map application service (such as Google Maps) so that the resulting distance matrix is more accurate.

299,Human Resource 4.0: A Vision Of A Technological Tool To  Assess And Foster Employee Engagement,"the digital paradigm, commonly called industry 4.0, has led many companies to adopt technologies that support process automation. the human factor has been left behind, which is in contradiction with the recommendations evidenced in the literature. since the creation of value in industry 4.0 can be reached profitably through the adoption of technologies that end up placing human beings at the center of modernization and improvement, the loss of skills due to the labor turnover is something to be avoided by companies. engagement is an employee's emotional state that manifests itself with motivation and absorption in the workplace. currently, the only way to assess workforce engagement is by using traditional scales techniques (such as, utrecht work engagement scale, orgallup q12 employee engagement scale). therefore, there are no mechanisms in the industrial environment capable of collecting data, which, properly treated, can predict employee engagement and help in recognizing when the employee is about to leave the company. this paper aims to present a vision about an innovative technological tool that intends to assess and, at the same time, to foster workforce engagement, in order to monitor the future possibility of them remaining in the company, or leaving.","industry 4.0, human resource 4.0, work engagement, 2018). in this way",,"juliana salvadorinho1,4, andreia vitória1,2, joão marques2,3, celeste varum1,2, carlos ferreira1,4, leonor teixeira1,4 1 department of economics, management, industrial engineering and tourism (degeit) 2 research unit in governance, competitiveness and public policies (govcopp) 3 department of social, political and territorial sciences (dspts) 4 institute of electronics and informatics engineering of aveiro (ieeta) university of aveiro aveiro, portugal juliana.salvadorinho@ ua.pt, atvitoria@ ua.pt, jjmarques@ ua.pt, camorim@ ua.pt, carlosf@ua.pt, lteixeira@ ua.pt","References

301,Factors Influencing The Diffusion Of Telehealth In Home  Visit Medical Services,"the outbreak of the long-lasting covid-19 pandemic has forced several changes, one of which is a change in the provision of health services. health care providers are looking for methods to meet patient needs, one of which is through telehealth innovation. telehealth is an innovation that combines technology and health services so that patients do not need to go to the clinic to get health services. before implementing these innovations, it is necessary to know the factors that influence consumers' desire to adopt telehealth innovations in health services. therefore, this study aims to determine the factors influencing consumers' willingness to adopt telehealth service innovations. an analytical framework is defined based on the diffusion of innovation theory (doi) to achieve this goal. the method used in this study is structural equation modeling (sem) with the help of partial least squares structural equation modeling (pls-sem) to analyze the hypotheses from the analytical framework developed in this study. factors that influence consumer decisions will be used as input in the development of telehealth innovation. proceedings of the international conference on industrial engineering and operations management monterrey, mexico, november 3-5, 2021 © ieom society international 2487",,"and Future Research The research framework, objectives, and respondents have been designed in this study. The assessment and analysis of the proposed innovations have been discussed to strengthen the hypotheses. The basic theory used is purely based on the Diffusion of Innovation Theory (DOI) by the goals and functions of the theory. It is highly recommended to continue this research by distributing questionnaires so that the hypothesis can be directly proven. The results of processing from the questionnaire can be implemented as a benchmark and a description of whether telehealth innovation has become the right solution. If the hypothesis is accepted then further research can be combined with supporting theories such as The Theory Acceptance Model (TAM). The SEM method is recommended to be studied more deeply according to the needs of the case study and can represent the relationship according to real conditions.

Case: Tracto Partes Diamante,"in this article, the company tracto partes diamante de puebla s.a. de c.v is studied, in which a new spare parts warehouse management strategy is proposed based on performance indicators or kpis (key performance indicators). the implementation strategy is divided into five stages: 1.- evaluating the current situation, 2.- designing the program and assignment of goals 3.- definition of kpis, 4.-standardized communication 5.-kpi's implementation proposal. with the new warehouse management proposal, the company seeks to improve work standards, strengthen the relationship with customers, increase the return margin, and achieve their loyalty with an improvement in the fulfillment of orders.","kpis, warehouse, process, importer","The logistics processes within a warehouse are fundamental aspects to guarantee customer service levels in compliance with product requirements, expectations in the quantities to be delivered, and the expected time of order fulfillment. With the proposal of the KPI’s, the company should: 1. Guarantee the efficiency levels of the activities carried out by the company, improving the delivery service and productivity resources involved profitability. of the organization 2. Understand the activities of the warehouse management processes. 3. Generate a baseline and identify the functions and design specific indicators for this area, allowing to determine the current state and making it possible to compare with future results to obtain precise conclusions of the increase or decrease in the efficiency of the company in the storage area, based on actual results achieved by the establishment of indicators. 4. Measure the quality, service, costs, and delivery time of the company’s customers, through the following factors: Receive their complete orders, not have a supply with the wrong materials, have a short delivery time, quality in the products, by not presenting no failure at the time of use, receive the material in good condition, obtain a low or no cost in shipping by parcel and have correct advice from the company's sellers to acquire the right products. About this point, for the moment, the company. It does not have a standard measurement to define customer satisfaction; the factors above are extracted from feedback from customers who experience any of the factors above. It would be essential to work on a survey plan applied to customers to know the aspects that can help the company strengthen customer loyalty and return. In this work, we proposed some indicators in each area of operation that will be very useful for the company and have greater effectiveness at the time of the arrival of the supplies to the warehouse. We conclude that the perfect use of these new tools can help the company Tracto Partes Diamante de Puebla SA de CV have greater efficiency in its warehouse and the distribution of its products, improving logistics on a large scale inside outside of the company.

Their pain points in using the said project were divided into three main categories: Accessibility, Registration, and Scanning. Lucy, Cecil, Gabriela, Grace, and Chico are having difficulties in the accessibility of Project X for reasons such as lack of internet connectivity, not all citizens of the Valenzuela are tech-savvy, difficulty in finding the web address for Project X, and hassle in accessing QR code. Cecil, Gabriela, Grace, and Bertha were struggling in registering for Project X because the website's text is difficult to read, and the password complexity requirement. Lastly, Lucy, Cecil, and Grace are having trouble with scanning the QR codes because of repetitive scanning due to unresponsiveness of the equipment, possible loss of QR code that may lead to identity theft, and forgetfulness in bringing the QR code. Furthermore, some concerns outside these main categories are repetitive filling out of health declaration forms in every establishment, time delays/bugs in saving QR codes, and time delays in filling out health declaration forms.

In terms of service time, step 4 (monitoring) is the slowest with 13 minutes and the fastest is the first step (form filling) with resulting in 2.47 minutes. In terms of waiting time, Step 1 has the longest time recorded with 16.80 minutes and the shortest having 7.91 minutes is in the third step (actual vaccination). In terms of the longest time in the system, Step 4 has the longest time with 13.54 minutes and the shortest is in the first step having 2.50 minutes. For the Probability of No Person in the system, Step 1 and 3 has the highest percentage and for the Probability of Busy Server, Step 2 and 4 denotes the highest percentage. Overall, the people spent the longest time in Steps 1 and 4, vaccination form filling and monitoring. The health screening and actual vaccination process have a shorter average time spent in terms of all the factors. This therefore concludes that the queuing system in these 2 processes were operated faster than in vaccination form filling and monitoring where people have spent more time in the process.","christlyn mae c. valeriano, charles kristian k. ilo, maria kathryne a. illescas, jan aldrin v. dahilig, rene d. estember school of industrial and engineering management mapúa university intramuros, manila, philippines cmcvaleriano@gmail.com, ilocharles023@gmail.com kathryne.illescas@gmail.com, janaldrindahilig@gmail.com rdestember@mapua.edu.ph",
307,Experimental Analysis On Determination Of Significant  Factors In Growing Mung Bean Sprouts (Length) In A,"the mung bean (vigna radiata) or “munggo” is a tiny, high nutrient, green bean from the legume family that is frequently consumed as a crispy sprout known as mung bean sprouts or “toge” in the philippines. it is used in a variety of different meals. furthermore, mung bean germination is a straightforward procedure and can be done in soil or water and generally germinates in four to five days. since there is demand for mung bean sprouts and large production is quite inappropriate for low-volume consumers and the current pandemic situation, an experimental analysis was conducted to know the right factors to consider in producing high quality yield of mung bean sprouts (in terms of length) in a home-based set up (non-soil). through 2k factorial design of experiment, 16 runs were involved having 3 factors which are the soaking time (a), rinse interval (b) and light exposure (c), and 2 replicates. moreover, it was found that single factors a and c significantly affects the length of sprout with an inverse proportional relationship. light exposure had the highest effect contribution value at 82.4%. all 2fi and 3fi were insignificant thus, soaking time and light exposure impact were generalized to the response.","factorial design, mung bean sprouts","The study concluded that light exposure (Factor C) is a significant factor and gravely affects the growth of mung beans. It also concluded that soaking duration (Factor A) is also significant to yield a longer and quality sprouts. Furthermore, the study also showed that the relationship of these factors to the response variable (length of sprout) is inversely proportional in a sense of having a negative coefficient in the model. Thus, this implies that when a consumer plans to do a home-based set-up (non-soil) of production of mung bean sprout, high levels of soaking time and light exposure should be critically controlled because increasing the amount or duration of these factors will result to a shorter mung bean sprout.

Based on the data that we have gathered most of the respondents still choose the actual shopping strategy when it comes in buying their grocery items in the supermarket based on the different criterion that was provided. For the overall performance, the actual shopping still performed the best among the three strategies that was provided. The performance of online and third party was still comparable to the actual shopping, however due to majority of the respondents was not able to experience the use of this new strategies of the supermarket. The probable reason for not experiencing these strategies is due to the constraints of the strategy since these services were only being offered within location of Metro Manila and near neighboring cities. In addition, traditional shopping has solidified its service in the country long before the two new strategies were being offered, hence the respondents would still prefer face-to-face shopping than the two strategies because this gives faster access to all products being offered by the store. 8.","amidst pandemic angelo luis s. doctora, william davin d. perez, franco neil a. sanchez, abigail b. vasquez, rene d. estember school of industrial engineering and engineering management mapúa university manila, philippines alsdoctora@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, wddperez@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, fnasanchez@mymail.ma pua.edu.ph, abvasquez@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, rdestember@mapua.edu.ph",

315,Risk Mitigation For Strengthening Supply Chain Strategies  In The Pandemic Era,"e-procurement in the organization will help the procurement process be more efficient and effective. in the development of e-procurement, there can be several risks. therefore, risk analysis is needed in the e-procurement planning process to overcome these risks. the identified risks are ranked using the fmea method by filling out a questionnaire by the respondents. based on the results of risk analysis using fmea, three high risks were found. the risk is that the user does not receive a notification if the procurement request is successfully made. the procurement report cannot be uploaded, and the procurement request cannot be continued. from this analysis, mitigation recommendations can be made to reduce or eliminate risk so that the e-procurement made is more stable to changes and can cover the entire procurement process.","risk, e-procurement, risk, procurement","Retaining a skilled workforce has become the biggest challenge for companies, due to the demands of technological developments and labor competition which are mostly driven by e-commerce. In this pandemic era, rising unemployment can reduce the pressure on labor needs in the short term. However, many companies are reducing costs related to their automation investment, resulting in less exploration of opportunities to improve supply chain efficiency. The solution starts from the upstream of a supply chain process, starting from company procurement that can be simplified and clearly measured. Presence Digital Procurement provides convenience for company procurement actors to reduce supplier risk, as well as facilitate the search for goods. In addition, there is also a digital approval process to speed up and facilitate procurement approvals, as well as limiting company spending quotas to match the initial procurement strategy and increase transparency.

317,Goal Programming Approach: Application In A Cake  Business,"formulating a model has always been a helpful technique in determining certain solutions with respect to certain constraints. in the business world, one technique would be the goal programming model. this paper focuses on the utilization of this technique for a certain business owner of a cake shop. the researchers were able to gather different data such as costs, and historical data that would help in determining dependent variables needed for formulation. different system and goal constraints were also listed in order to set parameters with respect to the performance of the business. the researchers then used excel solver in order to solve for the values of decision and deviational variables in order to find the optimal solution for this problem. in the findings, the researchers were able to conclude variables in which all the goals were achieved with respect to the system and goal constraints. the researchers were also able to provide a goal programming formulation in which it is said to have the ability to help the business owner for improvement and certain adjustments.","goal programming, business, covid-19, simplex method","The application of the Goal Programming approach can be used in all different aspects and venture in the business industry. As a matter of fact, the Goal Programming approach should be utilized more often especially in smaller businesses as this is a great way to achieve progress and reaching the desired goals set for a given period of time. This is important because effort and persistence is not always enough to bring a small business and turning it into a large striving business in the future. To do that, methods such as the Goal Programming approach is needed to tackle and identify the desired goals that can realistically be set and achieved through the use of the businesses data, resources and current operation capacity which this would differ among businesses. To conclude, the Excel Solver Run 2, 3 and 4 results prove to be the best choices since they yield the best optimal results to achieve their respective goal constraints where all the goal constraints are achieved. But for the Excel Solver Run 1, there exists three unachieved goal constraints which is why Excel Solver Run 2, 3, and 4 are the best choices to run to achieve the best results in achieving the goal constraints with consideration of their respective priorities.","lorenzo caday, krisanta ana draculan, jerome liwanag, wajid mariño, rene estember school of industrial engineering and engineering management mapua university, intramuros, manila, philippines ltcaday@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, kaedraculan@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, jlliwanag@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, wamarino@mymail.mapua.edu.ph. rdestember@mapua.edu.ph",
318,Preventive Maintenance Modeling On Die Casting Machines  With Information Systems,"from the results of observations at the company, the main problem found is that maintenance activities have not been carried out properly due to the tight production schedule. it is the reason for replacing components, only when the machine is damaged suddenly. the purpose of the study is to determine the type of machine that requires periodic maintenance, and critical components, along with how much reliability if applied through an information system. the case study method carried out is a quantitative method by processing data according to preventive maintenance. the analysis is carried out by determining the engine and critical components and then calculating the meantime to failure (mttf) and mean time to repair (mttr) to get the value of age replacement, availability, reliability, and downtime. the results achieved are increased availability and reliability and decreased total downtime by implementing proposed preventive maintenance for ladle, auto spray and heater components.","risk, procurement, supply chain, mitigate risk","Based on the calculation of preventive maintenance, it was found that the die casting machine-07 is a binding machine with selected critical components ladle, auto spray and heater. In addition, it is known that preventive maintenance actions, especially replacement of damage prevention, are carried out after the ladle component reaches a service life of 108 hours, the auto spray component is 506 hours, and the heater component is 320 hours. Moreover, by performing preventive maintenance, the reliability curve of the ladle component shows an increase of 92.44%, auto spray 129.25%, and heater component 80.07%. The application of information system applications can support engine maintenance activities in terms of data collection and calculation of engine and component performance. The company should pay more attention to the DC-07 engine and its components to keep the engine performance always in normal condition. Aknowledgment.

321,Optimizing Raw Material Orders Using A Comparison Of  Deterministic And Probabilistic Methods,"one of the factors that plays an important role in competition is service to customers. one of the services that can be provided by the company is to provide timeliness in the delivery of goods. an important factor that supports the timeliness is the ordering of the right quantity of raw materials and the time to order the raw materials. whereas if raw materials cannot be ordered in the right quantity and time, there will be a shortage or excess of raw materials, both of which will cause losses for the company. the research was conducted at a manufacturing company, which is order- based. the problem faced by the company is often experiencing inhibition of the production process and delays in sending orders to its customers. the aim of the research is providing propose regarding the method of ordering raw materials with the right quantity, considering the comparison of storage costs and the cost of ordering raw materials. the result was proposed decision of method to forecasting the need of raw materials, order quantity, and minimizing storage costs and raw material ordering costs.","manufacturing, material order, order quantity","As a make-to-order company engaged in button making. The problem faced by companies today is the supply of raw materials that often run out, due to the determination of the quantity of ordering raw materials that are not appropriate because it is done based on intuition and the absence of reserve raw material supplies. This certainly causes losses for the company, especially in terms of costs due to the production process that is hampered or must procure emergency raw materials to fulfil customer orders. Therefore, several stages are proposed that must be taken in determining the quantity of ordering raw materials. The first step is to collect historical data on the use of raw materials, then make an forecast of raw material needs for future periods. The next step is to calculate the quantity of order based on forecasting data, by comparing deterministic methods and probabilistic methods. In addition, there is also a calculation of safety stock or reserve supplies for each raw material so that it can overcome situations outside normal conditions, such as order surges.

322,Using E-Procurement To Minimize Risks In Customer  Service,"in a company both manufacturing companies and distributor companies, initially the purchase part is considered as a cost center, it turns out that now it has turned into a profit center for the company so that it plays an important role in the procurement process. where the buying part must make the purchase in a timely manner, the right amount, good quality, the selection of the right supplier and the most appropriate price. therefore, the company sees the need for the implementation of e-procurement so that the company can excel and compete and maintain and improve its customers, and to overcome problems that often occur in the conventional procurement process. it is important for companies to take a purchasing strategy that can provide convenience in relationships with suppliers and speed of exchanging information regarding procurement of goods. one of them is to change the old procurement system into e-procurement. the methodology used is the value network analysis method with the impact analysis and value creation analysis approach, which analyzes the solutions needed in the development of e-procurement. the result is a model of e-procurement that can be used to exchange information, negotiate with suppliers, and select suppliers who are more objective with supplier performance assessments. with the e-procurement system, it will be able to overcome problems that often occur in the conventional product procurement process, and the company can excel and compete and can maintain and improve its customers.","procurement, mexico, november 3-5","The importance of procurement of supplies is to support service to customers. Inadequate procurement of goods causes between the purchase and supplier parts to experience limitations in exchanging information and negotiations. Of course, as a distributor company for overseas suppliers, this becomes an obstacle and causes some problems for the company, especially the purchase part. Therefore, the company sees the need for an e-procurement system, to be able to handle problems that arise in the procurement process. The methodology used is (1) the value network analysis method with the impact analysis and value creation analysis approach, which analyzes the solutions needed in the development of e-procurement.

323,"A Queuing Theory Approach To Improve Service Quality Of  Banking Systems: A Case Study Of A Bank In Laguna,","this study applies queuing theory approach to improve service quality of banking systems in laguna, philippines. banking industry has been affected by the pandemic but, in comparison to other industries such as food, clothing, etc., it has been affected in other factors such as establishment capacity, and service quality. the researchers used data observed from 9:00am - 3:00pm, which was analyzed using inferential statistics and queuing theory. results show that waiting time for customers (senior/pwd) significantly differs from waiting time of regular customers. in addition, since the bank has 2 operational counters, it showed no significant difference between the waiting and service time of the 2 counters unless senior/pwd citizens are served. last, the type of probability distribution of the waiting, service, and total time in the system was determined using promodel 2016’s autofit function. initially, the type of probability is lognormally distributed, however since exponential probability is included in the top three, the data was deduced to fit as exponentially distributed. even without simulation testing, queuing analysis could be applied. it is recommended to utilize additional counter for all transactions where the management may continue the use of existing queuing behavior but with the reduction of waiting time.",queuing theory,"Queuing Theory is vastly used to solve issues that may reduce service quality since it is mainly affected by queuing time. With that and due to the lack of studies conducted in the Philippines with considerations of the capacity limit brought upon by the pandemic, this study is conducted in a bank in Laguna, Philippines where time study and observation was used to gather data that aided in the analysis of the current queuing system. The standard time of queuing and servicing time were identified and utilized to determine the areas of improvement of the current system. The target waiting time set by the management of the bank played a huge role in the analysis of data where it was stated that management has a target waiting time of 5 minutes in order to reduce exposure of the customers to the virus and to satisfy customers by not making them wait for an excessive amount of time in the bank. With that, it was determined in the queuing analysis of the current system that the root cause of longer time in the system is that there is no proper segregation for the accommodation of senior citizen and regular customers of only two (2) operating counters even though there is a total of three (3) counters in the system. Since the bank follows a First Come, First Serve (FCFS) and Priority (PR) queuing discipline, regular customers wait for their turn for transaction while senior citizen customers are automatically being catered once a server is available for transaction, regardless if the customer just arrived. The researchers mainly used the arrival rate, service rate, utilization rate, and waiting time in line as a performance measure to compare the data from both types of customers. It was proven in the calculation of queuing analysis that the waiting time of senior citizens is significantly different to the waiting time of regular customers. It was found that the arrival rate of regular customers is greater than its service rate, which means that number of regular customer arrivals magnifies faster yet they get stuck in the queue since the service rate does not compensate for the arrival rate, thus, resulting to a prolonged waiting time and total time in the system, which then elevates the risk of regular customers of being exposed to the virus. With that, the proposed solution or queuing management system involves the utilization of three (3) fully operational servers for the whole day where the management may continue the queuing behavior of serving senior citizens upon availability, that will not affect the waiting time of regular customers since there is an additional counter. Once the available servers are fully operational, this will significantly reduce queuing time and total time in the system of both Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management Monterrey, Mexico, November 3-5, 2021","philippines madeline anne patrice c. sy, frankern luis s. malabuyoc, ma. daniella m. sobrevilla, and rene d. estember school of industrial engineering and engineering management mapúa university intramuros, manila, philippines mapcsy@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, flsmalabuyoc@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, mdmsobrevilla@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, rdestember@mapua.edu.ph","References

324,Districting Based On Stochastic Demands,"this study proposes a mathematical model and a hybrid metaheuristic (based on greedy randomized adaptive search procedures and tabú search) for the distribution districting problem considering stochastic demand. the problem is inspired by a situation faced by a parcel company operating in monterrey, nuevo león méxico. the company desires to develop a strategic plan to district customers in pursuit of accomplishing two objectives: 1) balancing the average workload between districts (by minimizing the maximum workload content in a district), 2) creating compact districts, which is modeled as the minimization of the maximum distance between a pair of points in a district. . in gonzález- ramírez et al. (2017). as an extension and to incorporate the stochasticity of demand, we proposed to consider several representative days. we propose a single-objective optimization model in which we optimize the normalized weighted sum of the two objectives. as we are considering several demand scenarios, the proposed model minimizes the weighted sum of the maximum average workload content of each district (average over the demand days) and the compactness metric measured as the maximum time between the farthest away pair of points of a district. in order to normalize the parameters, we estimate the optimal allocation of workload among districts and the optimal compactness metric assuming a circular shape of districts. furthermore, it is very important that the workload of the districts respect a maximum service time. otherwise, the company has to pay extra time to the drivers. given that this is a soft constraint, we model it as a third term in the objective function, penalizing the exceeding workload content of each demand day and district. the proposed model was implemented in c++ and solved via cplex. since it could be difficult to solve large instances to optimality, a multi-start hybrid metaheuristic is also developed, combining elements of grasp and tabu search. at the construction phase, to generate multiple solutions, three heuristics to select a set of seeds are defined. the first heuristic selects the seeds among the most dispersed points. the second is based on a sweep algorithm, and the third one is very similar but considers the workload of each point. for each of the seed proceedings of the international conference on industrial engineering and operations management monterrey, mexico, november 3-5, 2021 © ieom society international 2715",,,"eduardo díaz medina facultad de ingeniería universidad panamericana zapopan, jalisco 45010, mexico ediazm@up.edu.mx samuel nucamendi-guillén facultad de ingeniería universidad panamericana zapopan, jalisco 45010, mexico snucamendi@up.edu.mx rosa gonzález ramírez facultad de ingeniería y ciencias aplicadas universidad de los andes santiago, chile rgonzalez@uandes.cl neale r. smith-cornejo industrial engineering department tecnológico de monterrey nuevo león, 64670, mexico nsmith@itesm.mx","References

325,An Application Of Decision Analysis On The Strategy Of  Professors With The Absorption Of Knowledge Between Face-,"the covid-19 pandemic has changed our educational life as online classes emerged as a way to adapt for educational institutions in the new normal. this has helped in continuing to cater to the educational needs of the students to prevent the spread of the virus. several intuitions have implemented ways on how online learning can be accessible and convenient for students. though this has been beneficial, the concern of professors in determining what is the best factor in the experience of students with their learning capacities given the situation. with more than a year in online classes, students have voiced concerns about today’s learning platforms as it affects several factors and challenges in the magnitude of their learning. this research aims to compare the absorption of knowledge of students between face-to-face learning and online learning, in order to identify what factor results with the highest absorption of knowledge. from that, the best strategy to be used by professors can be obtained. by conducting a survey, the researchers used the obtained data from the students of mapua university, to be able to perform various calculations, statistical and decision analyses. as a result, the factor of interaction/communication yielded the highest among other factors, which indicates that it should be considered by professors when conducting face-to-face learning and online learning, in order for the students to meet the maximum level of absorption of knowledge. as a conclusion, this also implies that the students were able to perform academically well whenever an interaction with their peers and classmates took place. given this, it can also be concluded that it is best for professors to provide interactive activities to their students to be able to obtain a high learning absorption.","education, students, absorption, program","The pandemic has made learning institutions be lenient in online classes to prevent the spread of the virus through direct contact with teachers, staff, and students. Although this has been beneficial to continue and to adapt to the learning system suited in this new normal, the concern on which is the better learning method in the absorption of learnings and activity performance of the students is determined. To further expound what learning method is what the student’s think is best for their learning absorption and activity performance, the results have shown that students in both engineering and non engineering prefer the Face-to-Face classes as their preferred learning platform. As for the students' experience in both Face-to-Face Classes and Online Classes, the factor of Interaction/Communication with professors and classmates are given as an important factor that maximizes how they absorb learning knowledge and activity of performance.","to-face and online learning julianne mikhaella delos reyes, louis miguel dural julia sofie mangaoang, gaea marithe victor, and rene estember school of industrial engineering and engineering management mapua university muralla st. intramuros, manila 1002 philippines jmcdelosreyes@mymail.mapua.edu.ph. lmcdural@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, jsdmangaoang@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, gmwvictor@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, rdestember@mapua.edu.ph","references and Behaviors.”

326,An Adaptation Of Industry 4.0: Modifying The Implemented  Queuing System In Philippine Statistics Authority,"the philippine statistics authority (psa) is a government agency responsible for handling civil registration services which include the responsibility for issuing birth, death, and marriage certificates. the tasks given to the psa face difficulty in managing queuing time for studies have shown that the psa has an inefficient and ineffective queuing system. the current queuing system of the psa involves an online application, but the certificates requested are delivered after a few days or weeks. the walk-in application faces long waiting times for customers, thus resembles poor queuing management. this study aims to resolve the long queuing time experienced by customers in requesting birth certificates. the study used define, measure, analyze, design, and verify (dmadv) process to determine the bottlenecks in the current queuing system and to provide modifications or alternative solutions that will reduce the waiting time of customers. monte carlo simulation was also utilized to generate expected results for both the current and proposed solutions. upon the utilization of tools, the researchers were able to provide two alternative systems. the first alternative incorporated a kiosk machine and was proven to be significantly different from the current queuing system but was not able to drastically reduce the queuing time. the second alternative applied a hybrid approach as it used online processing to replace some processes in the current queuing system. results showed that the second alternative was significantly better and more efficient than the other two queuing systems.","dmadv, queuing time, online processing","Queuing lines have always been a part of any industry that deals with goods and services (Troanca, 2014). Inevitably, waiting lines have always been an aspect that analyst tries to minimize since it can gradually become a source of conflicts. Ineffective management of queuing systems results in negative outcomes such as declines in demand and poor customer satisfaction (Chowdhury, 2018). With the importance of good queuing management, the researchers assessed the Philippine Statistics Authority’s queuing system for requesting birth certificates for which the study had determined to be ineffective. Due to the poor queuing management of the PSA, customers with a desire to obtain birth certificates spent an average time of 5.29 hours in the entire system just to finish the process. Also, customers were forced to wait for about 5.21 hours just to receive their birth certificates. These long queues resemble conflicts within the system for which the researchers would like to address. With this, the study used DMADV methodology to identify the bottlenecks of the current queuing system used by the PSA and to provide alternative queuing systems or modification that is expected to perform better than the existing queuing system. In this study, there are two alternative systems proposed by the researchers that were proven to be effective and better than the current queuing system. The first alternative utilized a Kiosk machine to replace the payment section. The replacement done by the researchers was able to reduce the processes from 19 to 14 specific processes. However, even with the modification, the researchers were not satisfied with the results since it did not significantly reduce the waiting Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management Monterrey, Mexico, November 3-5, 2021","applying monte carlo simulation matthew p. solivio, maria angelica d. bare, francee mae f. castro, kirstien paola e. robas, rene d. estember school of industrial engineering and engineering management mapúa university manila, philippines mpsolivio@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, madbare@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, fmfcastro@myamail.mapua.edu.ph, kperobas@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, rdestember@mapua.edu.ph","References

327,A Guideline To Improve The Business Continuity In The New  Normal (Covid-19) Through Human Resource Management:,"the sri lankan apparel industry is having a high demand for exports all over the world and is a leading apparel producer in the south asian region. it has started to fight for its survival due to the pandemic, covid-19. it guesses a bracing for a 50% drop in demand by the following one to one and a half years from covid-19. thus, the industry is in a position to reinvent itself by forcing itself to live. thus, business continuity is necessary to proceed with the business without any interruption at this time. moreover, human resource professionals act a major role to continue the business after the new normal, as handling the main resource of the organisation which is humans. hence, this study aims to develop a guideline to maintain the continuous business operation of the sri lankan apparel industry during the covid-19 through the commitment of hr professionals. initially, the literature review delivered a theoretical understanding of the research area and a semi-structured interview was selected as the primary data collection method. collected data were analysed using manual content analysis. the findings revealed that the challenges or factors that affect each hrm function during covid-19 were identified and the action or solution used to handle those challenges/ factors were collected. finally, the guideline was developed.",apparel industry,"This research aims to develop a guideline to maintain the continuous business operation of the apparel industry during new normal (Covid-19) conditions through the commitment of human resource professionals. Also, this research answered the research question of this study which is “How could improve the business continuity in the new normal conditions (Covid-19) of the Sri Lankan apparel industry through human resource management?”. Semi-structured interview data collection and analysis were contributed to achieving this study. By analysing the interview respondents, challenges or factors that affect each HRM function during Covid-19 were identified separately for all four selected human resource management functions such as recruitment & selection, performance management, employee engagement and compensations & benefits. Also, the action or solution used to handle those challenges/ factors of each human resource management function were collected and discussed. Accordingly, a guideline to improve the business continuity in the new normal condition like Covid-19 of Sri Lankan apparel industry through human resource management was developed and displayed. The guideline summarized and shows in one view that challenges or factors are available for each human resource management function separately and how those challenges or factors can be overcome. Moreover, this study has mutually significant academic and practical aspects. There are plenty of researches untaken separately for every three areas such as business continuity, new normal, and human resource management. Also, few research studies existing with the combination of ‘business continuity & new normal’, ‘business continuity & human resource management & ‘new normal & human resource management’. However, there is a lack of researches with the combination of all three of the above. Also, this research is significant in the selected industry, the apparel industry. The coronavirus outbreak is first and foremost a human tragedy, affecting hundreds of thousands of people. The spread of the coronavirus and the restrictive measures imposed everywhere in countries, along with self-restrictions of the population, have had a rapid impact on all most all the business not from the disease and virus, but from the measures taken to stop it. Thus, there is a requirement available for all the businesses to continue their business during the Covid-19 outbreak. Thus, the practical significance from this study will be helpful to maintain the continuous business operations during new normal conditions, especially at this post-Covid-19 stage. 6.","case of sri lankan apparel industry gowsiga mahendrarajah department of building economics university of moratuwa moratuwa, sri lanka. gowsigam@uom.lk sabrina nazeer department of building economics university of moratuwa moratuwa, sri lanka. sabrinanazeer@gmail.com kartheepan thavarasasingam university of western london t.kartheepan@yahoo.com",

These e-commerce platforms have procedures in place to ensure that customers are satisfied with their orders. However, these e-commerce sites have drawbacks when it comes to order processing. In this study, we focus on the four challenges that customers encounter and how they impact customer satisfaction. These are No update on delivery, Incorrect/Damaged item, Breach of confidential data, and Misleading advertisement. In this research, the researcher used Nash Equilibrium from game theory. The Nash Equilibrium results show that there is room for improvement in No Update on Delivery when it comes to updating the status of the customer's delivery, by informing the customer when the delivery is going to be delivered, and delivery process by regularly updating the customers during the delivery process. Incorrect/Damaged Items must improve the delivery process by continuing to provide the correct items to their customers. Breach of confidential data results in enhancing their security for the customer’s online transactions. Misleading advertisement results in their delivering process, they should lessen the misleading product advertising in their store. Based on our findings, OL-A offers more benefits and is easier for users to utilize. OL-A was rated more effective by 60% of respondents, while OL-B was rated 40% more","deceree anne a. haboy, daniel john b. sacramento, ervin josh p. santos christine angelie y. taw, rene d. estember school of industrial engineering and engineering management mapúa university manila, philippines daahaboy@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, djbsacramento @mymail.mapua.edu.ph, ejpsantos@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, caytaw@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, rdestember@mapua.edu.ph",
330,Product Launch Decision Making For Non-Preemptive  Product Development Process,"this paper presents a method of addressing the resource-constraint problem associated with non-preemption in product development (pd) process. in this work, we specifically consider the development of multiple products across a planning horizon where development personnel and development durations are the main constraints that delay product launch. relevant pd parameters were employed in defining the problem, and the problem was modelled as a contiguous-cells transportation problem with the objective of minimizing the “lost revenue” associated with the re- scheduling of pd processes due to unavailability of product development personnel. a hypothetical problem of scheduling six products across ten development quarters was then used to demonstrate the applicability of the model which yielded favorable results for product development schedules with minimal lost revenues. the result obtained shows that the method is effective and can be adopted by researchers and professionals to aid decision making in product development.","product development, non-preemption","This paper proposed the contiguous-cells transportation approach to aid decision making for product launch in non- preemptive PD process. The approach considered parameters relevant to the PD process and the problem was successfully formulated with an algorithm proposed to solve the problem. The methodology and results obtained reveals that the availability of development personnel throughout the product development horizon is vital to the timely release of products particularly in cases where preemption is not allowed during the PD process, and this also contributes to the overall market performance of products as it helps to reduce revenue losses. In conclusion, organizations must adequately plan to ensure that product development personnel are available throughout the entire PD horizon. Future works will focus on addressing real-life problems, considering stochastic ready times for product development and seek to extend the development resource constraints beyond development personnel to include other development resources relevant to the PD process.","adewole adegbola and venkat allada engineering management and systems engineering department missouri university of science and technology rolla, mo 65401, usa",

332,The Internet Of Things Start-Up Business Model For  Smartization Of Urban Transportation Serving Base Of The,"the advances in the internet of things (iot) and connected objects in recent years have created a paradigm shift in automotive systems, enabling more intelligent, safe, efficient, and comfortable transportation. the majority of the added value of these services was attained by consumers in developed countries. the mass-market consumers in developing countries, known as the base of the pyramid (bop), were primarily excluded from capturing these added values. this study examined startup businesses that provide iot services to bop consumers. we conducted a case study in iran, a country that experienced rapid population growth in the last 40 years, yet due to stagnated economic growth development, smart transportation systems remained unaffordable to consumers. however, in recent years, new iot startups have emerged in iran that offer smart transportation solutions. the focus of this study is to understand the adaptations made to the business model of these startups. we surveyed 250 individuals related to intelligent transportation systems namely from academic startups and incubators, automakers, component makers, services, and software solutions. the result of this study helps to provide nuances on business model innovations in the supply-side and demand-side of the value chain that enabled offering technology-based solutions to the mass market.",industries,"The study's findings provide empirical evidence to develop a model in innovative mobility businesses that offers value to low-income BOP consumers. This study adds to the growing body of research on smart urban transportation by focusing on the low-income mass market, a segment that has largely remained unstudied. Analysis of BMC reveals significant outcomes and offer solutions, particularly in customer relationship paths, key activities, key resources, and value propositions. The proposed business model, for example, states that companies should invest more in new ways of communicating with consumers, such as social networks and essential Internet services. One of the most significant findings of this study is that our research contributes to business model adaptations in urban transportation for the mass market consumers in developing countries. Furthermore, the most important approaches that knowledge-based companies operating in the IoT sector should take are to pay special attention to customer relationship processes, value propositions, key activities, and key resources. This research study can play a role in filling the gap of literature related to smart mobility business models as a starting point for future research, considering the obtained characteristics and emergence of smart mobilities technologies in developing countries.

339,Novel In-Situ Aircraft Oxygen Cylinder Refilling Tool,"currently, oxygen cylinders installed in an aircraft require refilling once to three times per production cycle for testing the oxygen system. refilling a cylinder requires removal from the aircraft, transportation to the fill shop, performing the filling operation, returning to the aircraft, reinstallation, and retesting the oxygen system. opportunity exist for damaging cylinders and contamination of the oxygen system along with adding a recurring potential for mistakes in the removal and installation of the cylinders and pressurization and depressurization of the system. a novel tool was developed to eliminate this lengthy and potentially hazardous way of working. using the newly defined tool, oxygen cylinders no longer need removal from the aircraft. only the pressure regulator must be removed from the cylinder assembly and the tool and fill cart attached to the cylinder, while remaining in its installed position. this process saves time and money as well as increases safety, both for personnel as well as for equipment. the tool is an assembly of existing qualified aircraft oxygen system parts and a pressure relief valve connected with copper based tubing. it is designed to minimize the potential fire hazard due to adiabatic compression heating during the filling operation.","oxygen, tool, aircraft, refill","The oxygen filling tool was found to be a new development in the realm of refilling oxygen cylinders aboard aircraft. It provides a safe and efficient means to avoid damaging cylinders due to removal and reinstallation after servicing in an oxygen shop. The ability to safely refill the oxygen cylinders while still installed in the aircraft saves time and prevents mistakes that may result in equipment scrapping and replacement or an oxygen fire. Testing and subsequent usage in the production environment provided proof that the tool works as designed and provides the time savings and reduced opportunity for equipment damage hypothesized.

342,Noninvasive Detection Of Glucose Levels Using A Commercial  Pulse Oximeter And Artificial Intelligence,"type i and ii diabetic patients must measure their glucose level from 2 to 10 times daily by invasive methods, the most used device is the glucometer. this device causes many problems to patients, such as discomfort, fear, pain, and a strong economic spending. nowadays, there are non-invasive methods that can determine the glucose level, but they are unaffordable for most people. detecting peaks on electrocardiograms (ecg) signals is indispensable to calculate heart rate variability (hrv), also, plethysmography can be used to determine hrv, but it requires a precisely algorithm without signal gaps. other researchers have found a strong relationship and statistical correlation between hrv and glucose level, but only limited statistical methods with non-representative databases had been used to estimate this correlation. regression and classification methods were used to determine the glycemic status of healthy patients; hrv was the main physiological variable used. designed ppg and ecg peak detectors were 99% accurate, this quality was critical to calculate a precise hrv. machine learning methods results were positive; the best classification method was random forests with an exactitude of 85% and best regression method was an assembly between svr, lasso and elasticnet models with an rmsd of 18.6621 mg/dl.","electrocardiogram, plethysmography, regression",,"luis guzman, antonio martinez-torteya and andrés garzafox universidad de monterrey av. morones prieto, monterrey, n.l. méxico luis.guzman@udem.edu, antonio.torteya@udem.edu, andres.garzafox@udem.edu",
343,Inventory Modeling For Automotive Spare Parts With   Probabilistic Demand By Considering An Integrated Cost,"the availability of spare parts for automotive products is one part of after-sales service, which is a critical factor that must also be considered to support customer acceptance and maintain the sustainability of the sales of these products. the fluctuating characteristics of demand for spare parts is a challenge for automotive manufacturers in preparing inventory levels so that they are always available in the correct quantity and time when customers need them. this study adds the objective function of profit and constraint of fill rate and costs in the calculation of the optimization model and is applicable for probabilistic demand characteristics. in addition, inventory classification based on the results of profit and fill rate optimization can be utilized as a reference for companies to prioritize and review the inventory management of existing skus.","backorder, re-order point, eoq","This research produces mathematical models and algorithms for inventory optimization and inventory classification in an integrated manner and can be implemented in general on inventory models with characteristics at PT X and other companies with the same characteristics. Fluctuations influence the re-order point and order quantity decision variables for each SKU in demand, although with different sensitivity levels. Meanwhile, changes in costs have no effect on the decision variables. Applying the proposed model and algorithm can improve the company's business performance by increasing the total profit by 13.3% and the fill rate from 76% to 95.1%. Inventory classification is divided into four groups sorted by the optimization value of PS (Performance Score), with the top 2 groups contributing positive profits and the other two groups contributing negative profits. In this study, improvements to the spare parts business operations were carried out on the 'supply' side, while from the 'demand' side, it was still wide open for development.

344,Development Of A Dashboard To Improve Fleet Maintenance  For A Food Bank,"fleet maintenance is the process fleet manager utilizes to manage fleet and asset information from acquisition to disposal. it helps the companies reduce costs, improve efficiency and safety. second harvest of metrolina food bank (shmetrolina) distributed over 70 million pounds of food and household items to approximately 800 partner agencies in 2019. with the critical need for transportation for distribution, a vehicle experiencing downtime will disrupt scheduled routes to partner agencies and increase repair costs for shmetrolina. this research developed an interactive dashboard using r shiny to help non-profit food bank fleet managers make informed decisions for effective fleet maintenance operations and support the food bank operations to meet hunger needs. the dashboard consists of the visualizations of the maintenance cost, mileage, and operational cost for individual and fleet vehicles from the data collected by the food bank.","dashboard, fleet maintenance, 1991","This research developed an interactive dashboard to assist food bank fleet managers to make data driven decisions. The interactive dashboard allows the fleet managers to detect the trend, identify potential problematic areas and take preventive actions. This research provides a way to integrate analytics with visualization to assist fleet management for a nonprofit organization. Finding of this research will benefit non-profit organizations that depend on distribution to reduce vehicle downtime, maintenance cost, or reduce errors related to fleet management decision-making. We have shown through visualization results that proper decision-making techniques can improve the overuse of vehicles and inefficient PM scheduling. However, the data collected in this study was limited to one fiscal year, and a more detailed analysis using at least five years of data (when available) could improve the effectiveness of the dashboard. 7.

345,Economics Of Small-Scale Power  Generation From Renewable And Hybrid,"the problem that influences the world on energy is climate change and until we increase our alternative sources the world will continue to face the energy issue. besides, greenhouse gas emission is a main issue which is related with current energy access. another global energy issue is hundreds of millions of people lack access to sufficient energy. in addition, depletion of natural resources become other crucial issue due to global energy consumption is growing in tandem with population growth, energy dependent patterns of usage composed with technological advancements. this study aims to focus on alternative power generation from renewable and hybrid sources in techno economic as a countermeasure for current energy sources issue in isolated communities which remote from the existing electricity transmission and distribution infrastructure. homer pro software and retscreen software are used to analyze best optimization of hybrid renewable energy system and check financial viability. a comparative analysis is done for 4 cases of energy: solar pv, wind, hydropower, and biogas to obtain estimation of net present cost (npc), levelized cost of energy (lcoe) and renewable fraction. his work also determines irr, simple payback and energy production costs.","renewable energy, hybrid energy, system","Comparing all results from HOMER Pro analysis and RETScreen® analysis, hybrid energy system of solar PV, diesel generator and storage system is the best choice to do investment in small scale. For this system, the NPC value and LCOE value is the lowest. Besides renewable energy fraction is more than 50% which is 68%. Then, refer to RETScreen® analysis, energy production cost is the lowest RM 0.29 only and has higher annual savings and revenue. This proposed system has fastest simple payback at 8.7 years only. Other than this system, hybrid energy system consists of hydropower, solar PV, and storage system. Although, the energy production cost is under third rank after number three, but as known wind speed in selected area is not enough to generate electric power. For the situation of any malfunction of solar PV, wind turbine will not be able to supplement the shortage due solar PV failure, thus combination of hydropower and solar PV is better choice.

346,Digital Twin For Urban Spaces: An Application,"a digital twin is a virtual representation of a real dynamic system that can simulate its current conditions, predict its future behavior, and log valuable information about its internal operation and interactions with other systems. a key feature is the capability of automatic bidirectional information flow between virtual and physical worlds. the objective of this work is to create a living lab for the demonstration of interacting urban digital twins under the united nations’ sustainable development goals of sustainable cities and communities, health and wellbeing, and industry, innovation, and infrastructure. by using a network of sensing devices mounted on a vehicle, the proposed system is capable of processing real-life data through edge computing, modeling software and machine learning algorithms. with the processed information, a 3d virtual representation of urban spaces and the vehicle itself, the interactions between both subjects and the evolution of each is enabled. this approach of digital twin technology for urban spaces has significant value when it comes to analyzing a community’s evolution, mobility, a vehicle’s dynamic behavior, and its interaction with urban infrastructure. this work presents the proposed methodology for developing digital twin concepts for urban spaces and vehicles as well as their respective characteristic components.","digital twin, simulation, modeling, urban spaces","on the behavior of their physical twins, these need to be as accurate and precise as possible to present the most real information as possible. For our system experiments, the validation process is carried out by comparing absolute true values to those output by our design system. In the case of the mapping module, distances and altitude is evaluated through percent error and RMSE calculations. When the system and individual models are complete, the use of other validation techniques are necessary. For our work, the Grieve’s Tests of Virtuality (GTV) will be performed to evaluate the ability of our models to mirror their physical twins. These GTV consists of three tests: sensory visual, performance, and reflectivity (Juarez et al. 2021) where the behavior similarity of both physical and virtual worlds is evaluated. • Sensory Visual Test: A tester subject demands a movement either from the DT or the physical twin and if the tester cannot differentiate among the real system and the DT, this test is approved. • Performance Test: The tester demands an action from both twins and if it cannot differentiate the performance among both, this test is approved. • Reflectivity Test: The tester demands information on the current state of the object, if there is no difference between the data from the physical and virtual twin, this test is approved. 5.4 Proposed Improvements With respect to the accuracy of the 3D urban space visualization, more research is needed to determine the adequate set of tools need to generate the most accurate maps. Automated PC classification algorithms have a 90% accurate classification percentage that, when used with tools like geospatial deep learning (DL) models packages, can be increased. These DL packages have already been trained by Esri with high volumes of geospatial information and could extract building footprints, land cover classification and tree point classification. LIDAR terrestrial sensing has limited ranging capacity in terms of a 3D space. As mentioned earlier, using this method, knowing the height for objects is not possible. Using drones for aerial LIDAR sensing is a good option to increase the level of detail (LOD) of the objects being registered, but specially of buildings, allowing to calculate the real height to objects, gather more data and create a better 3D representation. However, this data acquisition architecture will bring increased complexity and components to the system. Autodesk programs like Revit, Civil 3D or City Engine from ESRI, could enable a better LoD for buildings and infrastructure, allowing asset evaluation in several situations or simulations like energy consumption, flooding risk, zoning regulation, among others (Autodesk, 2020). These will be explored and assessed to determine their participation and interoperability with this project’s system. In terms of the vehicle’s DT, the use of the CAN Bus has presented challenges when it comes to decoding signals. For instance, each vehicle manufacturer will operate under different IDs and CAN protocols, meaning signals will never be decoded or identified in the same way on different vehicles. This challenge becomes even greater if the system is desired to have widespread adoption. A proposed improvement is developing an external network of sensors to measure the desired signals instead of having to sniff the vehicle’s private CAN Bus. 6. Conclusion Urban spaces DTs, requires a lot of systems, layers’ integration, and software interoperability, making it a design and management challenge. Working with statical data allows to understand how information could be processed for an increased LoD and integration level of modeled objects. One of the key improvements to enhance this DT system is utilizing real-time data from the different devices and processing them using edge processing techniques to obtain high quality and high-fidelity simulations and predictions. This will enable higher levels of maturity and integration. Before moving to automatic bidirectional information flow, individual system evaluation and validations processes need to be carried out to ensure maximum accuracy and precision. After this phase, the connection between all systems and platforms is the next challenge. With the current results, the system may already be classified in a maturity level 1 according to the DT maturity spectrum index. However, once the system is complete and once it is validated, a level 2 and even level 3 of maturity will be achieved. The static information and real-time information will come from the sensing devices mounted on Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management Monterrey, Mexico, November 3-5, 2021","diego m. botín-sanabria, jorge g. lozoya-reyes, roberto c. vargas-maldonado, karen l. rodríguez-hernández, ricardo a. ramírez-mendoza, mauricio a. ramírez-moreno, jorge de j. lozoya-santos school of engineering and science, mechatronics engineering department tecnológico de monterrey, campus monterrey eugenio garza sada 2501 sur, monterrey, méxico botin@tec.mx , mauricio.ramirezm@tec.mx , jorge.lozoya@tec.mx","References

The use of Lego gyro sensors made it possible to control and keep the EV3 rover robot movement on target path. The implementation in gmove command and its unique approach in combining proportional gyro control with acceleration deceleration control have demonstrated significant improvements. Within the limitation of FLL competition rule, the educational EV3 robot movement using gmove is sufficiently accurate where the robot is now capable to arrive at the destination point within plus minus 10 millimeters deviation.

349,Classification Of Driving Styles In The Metropolitan Area Of  Bucaramanga With On-Board Monitoring (Obd-Ii) In Real,"intelligent transportation systems (its) are key enablers to achieve the objectives of public transportation and transit policies. these systems make it possible to optimize the use of the existing tools and resources by increasing the control, effectiveness, efficiency and safety of transport systems and infrastructure, to better accommodate and manage the growing demand for mobility. this is achieved with the implementation of low-cost technologies that allow the monitoring and acquisition of data to consecutively create enough databases that are used by public and / or private entities for decision-making based on, management and future planning of the infrastructure. driving style refers to the way the driver operates the vehicle's controls in the context of the driving scene and external conditions such as, day of the week, time of day, weather, weather conditions, road type and the emotional state of people, among others. commonly, previous studies can be classified into two groups: survey or questionnaire studies and studies based on the variables (i.e characteristics parameters- cp’s) that describe the behavior when while the vehicle is running. some advantages to driving styles recognition and classifying task are: to save more than 25% of fuel consumption when good driving styles, improve the utilities of adas systems in automated vehicles and energy management system. in addition, driving cycles are developed as a tool to describe driving patterns through cp's, in some cases, including fuel consumption. also, they seek to reproduce real driving conditions with good precision and therefore, through them it is possible to classify driving styles based on statistical measures ( i.g standard deviation, mean square error - mse). the project aims to address mobility problems in the metropolitan area of bucaramanga by answering the question of what are the habits or driving styles of people in the region? from the implementation of an on-board monitoring system (obd- ii) for a sample of light vehicles greater than 15, recording data second by second for 4 months, which will allow, to develop a local driving cycle more representative and at the same time, classify the driving styles that help to adequately describe the driving pattern in the city from statistical methods. finally, by identifying driving styles, it is possible to know what the driver's habits are when facing the different driving conditions, and thus establish the future work to solve mobility needs existing in the city.","driving styles, driving cycles, mexico, november 3-5",,"road conditions. juan danilo molina martínez. brayan ferney acuña olivar and jessica gissella maradey lázaro mechatronics engineering program universidad autónoma de bucaramanga bucaramanga, santander, colombia jmolina54@unab.edu.co, bacuna152@unab.edu.co, jmaradey@unab.edu.co jose ignacio huertas cardozo mechanical engineering department tecnológico de monterrey monterrey, nuevo león, méxico jhuertas@tec.mx",
350,Use Of Technology For Better Understanding Of Cities,"the transformation of cities is key to achieve the sustainable development goals (sdg) in the near future. the worsening climate crisis urges to long-term solutions which orientate the development of cities to be more sustainable and livable spaces. urban planning remains as a complex task and, therefore, benefits from the use of technology to better assess the actual needs of cities and find the best way to conjugate the already existing resources towards smarter and more accessible places. hence, this study focuses on the implementation of urmoac, a tool developed by the german aerospace center, to obtain useful data about the san francisco bay area which in return can be utilized to shape and guide planning processes oriented to promote urban accessibility and the sdg. the results demonstrate that the urban areas of san francisco bay area have good accessibility levels to public primary schools and help to understand the dynamic environment of the cities involved and plan accordingly to create smart mobility.","climate change, urban analysis, technology, urmoac","In conclusion, changes must be implemented in cities to make them more sustainable aligned with the SDGs. Therefore, the use of technology emerges as a great help to understand the operation of the city and thus apply the necessary improvements depending on each situation. With the results obtained by applying the UrMoAc tool, we can confirm its usefulness and versatility since it allows to know in a very fine level of detail the operability of a city considering its urban structure, morphology, transport modes and destinations. These characteristics make it a valuable tool for designing and planning the cities of the future. Moreover, it is an easy-to-use tool that can be adapted to the needs of different places to develop smart mobility all over the world.","karen l. rodríguez-hernández, ana l. gaxiola-beltrán, jorge narezo- balzaretti, mauricio a. ramírez-moreno, ricardo a. ramírez-mendoza, jorge de j. lozoya-santos school of engineering and sciences tecnologico de monterrey, campus monterrey eugenio garza sada 2501 sur, monterrey, mexico a01197734@itesm.mx , karen.rdz@tec.mx",

355,Digital Twin For A Vehicle: Electrobus Case Study,"a digital twin is a virtual representation of a real dynamic system that can simulate its current conditions, predict its future behavior, and log valuable information about its internal operation and interactions with other systems. the unique capability of automatic bidirectional information flow between virtual and physical worlds and predictive analysis of digital twins are what make this emergent technology greatly innovative and of significant value. the objective of this case study is to implement a vehicle’s performance digital twin concept on an electric passenger bus and analyze the technology’s adaptability level, capabilities, scope, limits, and future improvements. this system incorporates a network of sensing devices mounted on the vehicle, a real-time simulation model, edge computing capabilities and the possibility of incorporating predictive maintenance models to determine remaining useful life of components. the digital twin is thought to have great value when it comes to gaining deep insight on the dynamic performance of the bus, analyzing energy waste, exploring determining factors of energy usage and monitoring the current and future state of the vehicle. all of this being possible through simulation technology, digital modeling, physical and virtual sensors, edge computing, internet-of-things networks, and machine learning algorithms.","digital twin, simulation, vehicle dynamics, case study","on the behavior of their physical twins, these need to be as accurate and precise as possible to present the most real information as possible. For our system experiments, the validation process is carried out by comparing absolute true values to those output by our design system. In the case of the mapping module, distances and altitude is evaluated through percent error and RMSE calculations. When the system and individual models are complete, the use of other validation techniques are necessary. For our work, the Grieve’s Tests of Virtuality (GTV) will be performed to evaluate the ability of our models to mirror their physical twins. These GTV consists of three tests: sensory visual, performance, and reflectivity (Juarez et al. 2021) where the behavior similarity of both physical and virtual worlds is evaluated. • Sensory Visual Test: A tester subject demands a movement either from the DT or the physical twin and if the tester cannot differentiate among the real system and the DT, this test is approved. • Performance Test: The tester demands an action from both twins and if it cannot differentiate the performance among both, this test is approved. • Reflectivity Test: The tester demands information on the current state of the object, if there is no difference between the data from the physical and virtual twin, this test is approved 6. Conclusion The results and designed software for this work already has great value in terms of setting a baseline for the future development of the DT for a vehicle and for urban spaces. Implementation is still pending, however after the proposed validation techniques, system integration will be feasible, and implementation would be the next step. In this sense, the objective for the project is still to be reached. Some challenges and limitations have already been worked around. For instance, implementation costs due to the number of devices and software needed is a challenge to overcome. For this, open-source software and popular platforms were used and tailored-made designs developed. Other challenges like the complexity of interoperability amongst software was experimented. Matlab and Simulink were a solution option due to their facility to interact with other platforms. With the current results, the system may already be classified in a maturity level 1 according to the DT maturity spectrum index. However, once the system is complete and once it is validated, a level 2 and even level 3 of maturity will be achieved. The static information and real-time information will come from the sensing devices mounted on the vehicle. This will also demonstrate the interaction between an urban space DT and a vehicle DT concept. Furthermore, the current system may be classified as a SoS level hierarchy and an integration level of Digital Shadow. When the system is complete, the integration will be classified as a Digital Twin. A lot of work needs to be done with the interoperability and connectivity of platforms and devices. It is a special challenge when it comes to real-time data processing, and enabling technologies such as ML, Big Data, IoT and edge processing have a great role. Future work will focus on connecting both physical and virtual world and performing experimentation to evaluate and validate individual systems. After this, implementation of the DT for Electrobus will be enabled. 7. Acknowledgements For the development and implementation efforts, a total of 5 associated companies are involved.

356,Conscious Mobility For Urban Spaces Application,"in this paper we present a holistic perspective of what conscious mobility consists of, focusing on electromobility as the principal driver through a more efficient and greener transportation system. three sustainable development goals (sdg´s) are mentioned, being a point of reference for a critical route towards the 2030 united nations agenda, these in conjunction with the project dimensions and frameworks proposed, give as a result a first draft of how a methodology for smart mobility in mexican cities could be. this methodology includes several diagnostics meant for specific size areas that leads to a planning phase where private and public requirements, and aspirations should be analyzed. it can be found that there is a social dimension that has been disassociated from mobility and the optimal way to transit from fuel-based transport to renewable energy is through electromobility, but the success of this transition will rely on ppp’s actions required to create a functional electromobility system.","smart city, smart mobility, conscious mobility, distrito tec","Nowadays there is a lack of conscious mobility at a local level. Therefore, it will be necessary to increase research flow on this topic. It can be seen clearly an intention to implement new norms regarding new mobility, however it is important to embrace new methods of transportation, not only with law enforcement but infrastructure investment. It is known that there is an economic dimension of mobility where newer technologies imply higher costs in a short period of time but higher savings in long term schemes. Nevertheless, there is a social dimension that has been disassociated from mobility although it should be one of the main lines of research, a conscious mobility. From a technology standpoint, electromobility will be the best path for migrating from a fuel-based transportation system to a renewable energy transportation system, establishing the beginning for a strategy that has as key objective reach United Nations SDGs goals that were proposed for this project. A successful transition will depend on the PPP´s efforts to establish an agenda that fulfills the regulations, normative and actions required for a functional electromobility system in its operation and as a business model, giving the fair incentives for every automotive company that want to aggregate EV´s to its vehicle fleet. Interoperability advantage from this new transportation system will accelerate its shifting time, but as this technology is still in development its acquisition could just be performed by developed countries, stretching the gap between developed countries, and developing countries.

357,Development Of An On-Board System For Measuring The  Implicit Variables Of The Driving Cycle For 250Cc Carbureted,"the implicit variables of the driving cycle are closely related to level of emissions produced by the vehicles, particularly, these are equipped with a series of pressure, flow, temperature, and instrumentation sensors that allow the measurement of the vehicle speed and engine revolutions, including gps modules that allow collecting altimetry and position data in real time. however, motorcycles with displacements less than 250 cc usually use a carburetor and do not have all this instrumentation since it would raise the manufacturing cost, and consequently, sale price. this is a key factor to the customers which prefers that mode of transportation due to the facility of movement in congested roads and low cost of operation. specially, in some countries such as colombia, the quantity of motorcycle and traffic is very high and thus a higher rate of violation of regulations, its participation in accidents and contribution in air pollution should be considered more carefully. the challenge is the inclusion of precise technology without increasing costs and to be able to monitor its performance and location to include it in a smart city environment. currently, there is no low-cost device developed in colombia for the measurement of real fuel in motorcycles, since most of the engine types are fueled by carburetor due to the nature of the combustion process it is difficult to get an accurate measurement and find available sensors or embedded systems in the market. another reason why a device of this style has not been developed is because the cylinder capacity of these motorcycles is less than 250 cc, with which fuel consumption goes unnoticed by the owners of these vehicles, creating little awareness of saving and caring for the environment in terms of polluting gas emissions. besides, the study of driving cycles is a useful task to be able to analyze the environmental and economic impact that the use of vehicles and motorcycles leaves in a given area, since fuel consumption and vehicle speed are closely related to emissions. the project aims to design a semi-industrial scale an instrumental system that monitors and records the position, speed, rpm and fuel consumption of a carbureted motorcycle with a displacement of less than 250 cc as well as develop a mobile application that allows the visualization and storage in the cloud of the data obtained from a monitored route. finally, is necessary to carry out the device performance test based on measurements obtained through laboratory and road tests.","motorcycles, driving cycles, mexico, november 3-5",,"motorcycles ray stevenson amaya maldonado, santiago uribe jaimes and jessica gissella maradey lázaro mechatronics engineering program universidad autónoma de bucaramanga bucaramanga, santander, colombia ramaya419@unab.edu.co, suribe62@unab.edu.co, jmaradey@unab.edu.co jose ignacio huertas cardozo mechanical engineering department tecnológico de monterrey monterrey, nuevo león, méxico jhuertas@tec.mx",
358,Assessment Of The Process Of Generation And Final Use Of  Electric Energy In Colombia Based On Energy Efficiency,"the recovery of the global economic activity following the covid-19 pandemic, caused emissions associated to energy consumption to be 2% higher in december 2020 than the same month in 2019. the migration to a low carbon energy system is essential, achieving the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions (ghg). energy efficiency is a key point in clean energy transitions and energy efficiency policies the development path, which in 2019 covered only 35% of the final energy use. colombia committed to reduce 51% of its ghg emissions by 2030 compared to the projections made for that year. the country electric generation is relatively clean, 69% corresponds to renewable energies (re) and the remaining 31% to fossil resources, with associated emissions of 11,82 gtco2eq for the year 2019. however, colombian electric system is unstable, due to the water resource dependence, which can be affected by variable weather conditions, and to the high energy losses that reached 60% in 2012, with a cost of 5200 million dollars per year. therefore, it is necessary to generate energy efficiency strategies and policies in the colombian electric system, due to its relationship with the economic competitiveness, energy security and environmental benefits. the impact of these strategies and policies implementation can be monitored through an energy efficiency indicators analysis that allow taking timely actions to meet energy goals. thus, the main purpose of this study is to determine energy efficiency indicators to evaluate the current state of the colombian electric system, analyzing the trends and historical dispersion of the data. it was made a compilation of the historical variables selected for the calculation of the following energy efficiency indicators: generation efficiency, energy intensity, emission intensity, co2eq emissions and per capita consumption. based on the preliminary results it is concluded that, although colombian energetic matrix is mainly composed by re, it is susceptible to the world oil market variations, due to the crisis occurred during 2014 and 2016 years, where the international oil prices dropped, causing a 1% negative increase in the electric generation during 2015 and 2016 years, which had a relative annual growth rate of 3%. on the other hand, this study is a macro project preliminary step, which seeks the construction of a platform that allows to variate different key parameters, to generate and project energy efficiency strategies which can adapt to the needs of the different entities associated in the generation, distribution, and end use processes of the country electric energy.","energy efficiency, electric energy, indicator",,"indicators juan zapata-mina, melissa valencia-duque, juan josé tabares y juan esteban tibaquirá faculty of mechanical engineering universidad tecnológica de pereira pereira, colombia juan.zapata1@utp.edu.co, melissa.valencia2@utp.edu.co, juan.tabares@utp.edu.co, juantiba@utp.edu.co",
359,Facial Recognition System For Access Control Through The  Application Of Convolutional Neural Networks,"in recent years, biometric systems have been used to provide access control security, to help identify and recognize people. however, today due to the advance of the pandemic some of the biometric systems are considered as sources of transmission and contagion of covid-19. this situation motivates us to the development of a facial recognition access control system through the application of convolutional neural networks (cnn) that, by not having physical contact with the devices, safeguards against covid-19. a pre-trained vgg16 model was used and the new cnn model was trained with the transfer learning application. the recognition system was tested using a public database such as celeba, obtaining an accuracy of 84%, this isn't the best possible accuracy as some authors report better results. however, our objective was not to provide the best accuracy with random data, we only need to achieve good accuracy with the company's controlled data, our cnn model achieves an accuracy of 98% in controlled conditions with an average identification time of 80 milliseconds. it has a low implementation cost that allows it to be competitive in low-income countries, like ecuador, compared to international costs of state-of-the-art systems.","transfer learning, face recognition, (phillips","In this work, we were able to implement a deep learning model based on convolutional neural networks for face recognition through the application of Transfer Learning. The training time of the CNN was optimized and the data processing time was 13 seconds. The system response was simulated and validated by generating a confusion matrix through the input of untrained faces contained in the test folder. With the results obtained for each class, the system achieves a 98% accuracy with an average identification time of 80 milliseconds. The accuracy obtained corresponds to the number of trained persons, which are 10, with a number of images for Train: 300 and Test: 1000, the accuracy of the system can be improved if we increase the number of images of each employee. The learning curves show that at epoch 13 there is a crossover point between loss and accuracy, indicating that the CNN network has gained knowledge. As the training progresses, overfitting is not diagnosed. Therefore, the number of epochs could be decreased to optimize the training time of the CNN. An access control system was developed with great accuracy, in order to recognize the employees of micro-enterprises, where the lighting environment is controlled.

360,Predicting Subgrain Size And Dislocation Density In  Machining-Induced Surface Microstructure Of Nickel Using,"microstructure evolution under interactive effects of severe shear strains, strain-rates and the accompanied temperature rise often follows complex trajectories. encapsulating the process–structure linkages under these conditions is vital for prediction and control of product outcomes from processes that involve severe plastic deformation. this paper examines the microstructure transformations during severe shear deformation induced by plane strain machining (psm) on high-purity (99.99%) nickel. deformation conditions in both chips and the surface are created using psm and characterized via in-situ techniques which are then juxtaposed with orientation imaging microscopy (oim) via electron back scattered diffraction (ebsd). the dislocation densities are quantified using the broadening of x-ray diffraction peaks of crystallographic planes. we capture the variation of microstructure response (subgrain size and dislocation density), by applying the supervised model-based learning techniques combined with physics-based models to enhance the predictions performance. the features involved in the study are cutting speed, rake angle, temperature, strain, strain-rate, in addition to lnz and a rate parameter r identified from the saturated proceedings of the international conference on industrial engineering and operations management monterrey, mexico, november 3-5, 2021 © ieom society international 3008",,,"supervised model-based learning faruk abedrabbo department of industrial engineering universidad de los andes carrera 1a no. 18a-10, bogota, colombia af.abedrabbo@uniandes.edu.co juan camilo osorio department of mechanical engineering universidad de los andes carrera 1a no. 18a-10, bogota, colombia jc.osorio10@uniandes.edu.co sepideh abolghasem department of industrial engineering universidad de los andes carrera 1a no. 18a-10, bogota, colombia ag.sepideh10@uniandes.edu.co carlos valencia department of industrial engineering universidad de los andes carrera 1a no. 18a-10, bogota, colombia cf.valencia@uniandes.edu.co fabio rojas department of mechanical engineering universidad de los andes carrera 1a no. 18a-10, bogota, colombia farojas@uniandes.edu.co",
361,Performance Comparison For File Transfers For Four  Advanced Networks In Gns3 Under Ipv6.,"advanced networks have been studied through emulation testing connectivity and management under ipv4 and ipv6 using their corresponding routing and management protocols such as isp companies do for backbone infrastructure. in this work, given four different and complex backbone advanced networks in different regions in the world, four different kinds of files have been transmitted from one extreme to another for each backbone network then time and computational resources have been considering, testing gns3 capabilities when emulating under ipv6 using limited cpu and ram resources. the four advanced networks are africa connect for africa, geant for europe, ameronet for america, it means the joint of canarie, internet2 and clara, and pacific wave for many countries in the pacific. those four advanced networks involve 187 backbone routers. given a specific hardware resource, results show capabilities and limitations when testing different file transfers when emulating advanced networks. this work adds to evidence of the potential for gns3 but indicates an issue for transferring video files around 10mb for the combo gns3 and core i7 and 16gb using 70% for cpu and 80% for ram.","advanced networks, internet","Four complex backbone advanced networks were emulated using the c7200 backbone routers and virtual machines to test the file transfer for text, image, audio, and video files to verify the GNS3 and computer resources performance under IPv6 OSPFv3 and BGP-4 protocols. Ping and Traceroute test were executed to test connectivity for each topology, then the file transfer was tested for each topology and four times for each file transfer then the average was taken. All tests ran under the same conditions for each topology. Results show spent time for file transfer for different weights is proportional in a way, but three main details must be remarqued, the first one is that no differences are shown for text files, maybe because the size of the sent file. The second one is that spent time is proportional to size of the sent file for all kind of files and for all topologies. But the third one, and maybe the most interesting conclusion is the fact that there is a notable difference in time for those two backbone topologies which use BGP-4 as an additional AS routing protocol. It means AFRICACONNECT and GEANT which used just OSPFv3 spent less time than AMERONET and Pacific Wave which used BGP-4 additionally, so not only the size and complexity of the topology is important particularly when transferring video files, but also when transferring from one AS to another.

362,A Survey Of Approaches To Describe Driving Patterns.,"the efficient use of resources, sustainability, innovation, the inclusion of information technologies such as iot and industry 4.0, urban planning, public management, social cohesion, citizen security, mobility and transport are the tools which a city must be considered smart. smart cities have emerged as a response to problems such as climate change, high energy consumption due to population density of cities, difficulty in mobility due to the imbalance between roads and vehicle systems (i.g motorcycles, vehicles, bicycles, public transport), competitiveness and economic growth. also, the need for intelligent mobility arises as a solution to the problems of vehicular traffic (i.e congestion), pedestrian traffic and lost time, unsafety , air pollution, the growth of the vehicle fleet both in quantity and in diversity of vehicle types and the limited availability of road infrastructure. these factors have a direct impact on driver behavior (i.e trend and style), on vehicle use and performance (i.e modes of operation) and on energy consumption (i.e fuel consumption, or electricity) and on the direct or indirect emission of pollutants. the way the population drives is known as the driving pattern (dp). currently, there is no clear definition of dp. commonly, dp has been defined as that which describes the behavior of the driver. in a broader sense, dp should describe the way in which one drives in a specific region, including not only human factors (driving behavior) but operational factors (driving style) as well as reflecting the driving conditions (driving conditions). then, it is necessary to determine other characteristics of the driving pattern and not only the average speed is enough. dp varies from one region to another, which limits the application of valid and widely used techniques. for this reason and the availability to collect sufficient data, it is unknown whether latin american cities present similarities in their driving patterns. frequently, driving patterns are represented by characteristic parameters (cp) which are dependent on speed and time. to obtain the cps, a second-by-second record of the vehicle speed is required, which is obtained through gps (global position system). this process must be carried out on a representative sample of vehicles for at least one year of operation to capture seasonal behaviors, which makes it highly costly. currently, there is no consensus on the number of cp's that should be used to recognize the driving pattern nor on what is the appropriate methodology to describe them in a generalized, reliable, and representative way. other alternatives to describe dp are: vehicle specific power (vsp), speed- acceleration probability distribution (sapd), driving cycles (dc) and driving pattern recognition (dpr). knowledge of local driving patterns is required to identify and design strategies that help reduce energy consumption and vehicle emissions. likewise, is possible to recognize and evaluate the driving styles of a region respectively. this project aims to show current methodologies and evaluate the performance to describe local driving patterns.","driving patterns, driving cycles, mexico, november 3-5",,"jessica gissella maradey lázaro mechatronics engineering program universidad autónoma de bucaramanga bucaramanga, santander, colombia jmolina54@unab.edu.co, bacuna152@unab.edu.co, jmaradey@unab.edu.co jose ignacio huertas cardozo mechanical engineering department tecnológico de monterrey monterrey, nuevo león, méxico jhuertas@tec.mx",
363,Microgrid Supplier Selection Problem Considering  Euclidean Distance And Ideal Vector System,"in the present research two new methods to select optimal suppliers considering component replacement policies for a micro-grid were developed, the main objectives considered in the replacement problem are to minimize the overall system costs (operation cost, maintenance cost), as well as maximize the overall system efficiency. once the replacement schedules are generated, we propose two methods, a) euclidean distance and b) ideal vector system) to select suppliers to replace components in the system. the methods are applied to a previously designed micro-grid, the euclidean distance method looks for solutions (vectors) defined by the closest distance that most closely resembles the desired (ideal) vector (solution), which is the one with a smaller distance to the ideal vector, the closest solution, as defined by the euclidean distance, will be the one the one that offers in this case a more efficient condition to the characteristics of efficiency and system cost, among others. the second method proposed in the present work, the ideal vector system, considers the gains that exist between the characteristics of the participating vectors (solutions), for example, cost is a characteristic for which the negative gain becomes a positive gain for this algorithm, and characteristics such as component life considering the longer components’ life the better for the system. the final solution is found in the vector that defines the highest gain; all characteristics are converted into a vector in values per unit referenced to a desired vector established by the decision maker. the proposed methods are applied to a microgrid previously generated by using a microgrid design allocation algorithm and after running a component replacement analysis model. finally, the two proposed methods are applied to a microgrid and both methods converge to select the same suppliers to replace components in the micro-grid.",micro-grid,"This work is based on the selection of components of the micro-grid solar panel stand-alone once they must be selected to replace an existing component that in theory will be out of service. This algorithm is based on the creation of vectors using the characteristics of the potential components provided in a finite number of providers, these vectors will be compared in distances against a desired vector. The vector that keeps the least distance against the desired vector will be the vector to be selected by the algorithm. Another algorithm contemplates the gains that exist between the characteristics of the participating vectors, such as cost is a characteristic of greater better, for which the negative gain becomes a positive gain for this algorithm, as well as characteristics such as life It is useful that larger populations are better, it is a characteristic that does not change sign, it remains positive throughout the process, so the vector that offers the highest gain will be the vector selected by this algorithm. In this particular work, it was found that both methodologies converge at the same provider selection points based on a desired vector. Despite this example is limited by only three providers and a specific number of characteristics to evaluate, this work can be taken to more complex instances of selection contemplating variable elements of the components that are involved in the operation of the same components. Perhaps, where the geographical areas with variation in solar irradiation are present as parts of the estimation variables. Considering international suppliers in the process with variation in the monetary values that are involved in the costs of the elements.","trinidad reyes and jose f. espiritu industrial manufacturing and system engineering department the university of texas at el paso el paso, tx 79968, usa jtreyesport@miners.utep.edu, jfespiritu@utep.edu",

374,Investigation Of Simple Moving Average: Pre-Covid-19  Evidence From The Tokyo Stock Exchange,"investment strategies have important theoretical and practical implications. as one of the main strategies, technical analysis (ta) is a well-known investment analysis for investors. usually used with fundamental analysis, it helps the investors to analyze stock performance. ta helps investors to predict the future pattern of an investment by using historical market data. in contrast, efficient market hypothesis (emh) is the ideal market which the price reflects all information in the market. the purpose of this study is to investigate market efficiency of japanese equity market, tokyo stock exchange (tse), by using ta. we use a sample of three (3) stocks from the tse for selection and analysis based on simple moving average (sma). the period performance and performance ratio are also determined to test the validation of sma. our results show that sma failed to predict the market. the inverse result between sma and stock performance, and the poor performance of ratios indicate that sma failed to predict tse, thus implying market efficiency. this paper builds the foundation for other researchers to analyze the japanese stock market.","technical analysis, 1952","In this paper, we explored the profitability of SMA in the TSE. We find that SMA fails to find any historical pattern, and our results suggest the Japanese stock market is weak form efficient. However, our study only utilizes simple strategy, which is SMA. Therefore, there might still be possibility that the market is inefficient, but the SMA is unable to identify any pattern. Indeed, the profitability of TA relies on market inefficiency. If the market already reflects all available information (in this case historical stock prices), TA is hence useless. However, several studies such as Nor and Wickremasinghe (2014), Nor and Zawawi (2019) and Shahzad et al. (2017) show that not all markets are efficient. Although this might be true, technological advancements can also lead to market efficiency, as argued in Nor and Wickremasinghe (2017) in the Malaysian stock market. Moreover, stock prices can also be affected by different factors, including macroeconomic variables, economic policy uncertainty and oil prices. These issues have been explored by researchers such as Abuoliem et al. (2019a,b), Hasan et al. (2020a,b), Naeem et al. (2021) and Shahzad et al. (2017a,b). Bearing these in mind, further studies are needed to investigate the profitability of TA by using different TA models and markets. Rather than using simple rule such as SMA, future studies can investigate rules such as moving average convergence divergence (MACD) and the relative strength index (RSI). In addition, issues such as environment, social and governance (ESG) can also be explored to enhance TA decision making process. For example, in the context of portfolios, Nor and Zawawi (2018) focused on the differences of performance in the investment portfolios between strong and weak corporate governance. This line of research is further supported by Rehman et al. (2021), who show that investors in the emerging markets are now seriously looking into socially responsible investing.","wisnu panggah setiyono department of management, faculty of business, law and social science, universitas muhammadiyah sidoarjo, sidoarjo, east java 61215, indonesia wisnu.setiyono@umsida.ac.id liau zheng pin kinematic business management sdn bhd, puchong gateway, 47110 puchong, selangor, malaysia s46249@student.umt.edu.my tsabita karima department of digitally business, faculty of business, law and social science, universitas muhammadiyah sidoarjo, sidoarjo, east java 61215, indonesia karimatsabita8@gmail.com",
375,An Aggregated Time Series Forecasting Model For The Health  And Wellness Sector: Case Of A Brazilian Retail Company,"the increasing variety in the retail sector and complexity of the forecasting problems resulted in the need for increasingly complex predictive models with difficult parameterization. when demand forecasts for a considerable number of items need to be performed, the forecasting process can take several hours or even days, which can be detrimental to business operations. this paper addresses this dilemma by presenting a model for forecasting retail demand in the health and wellness sector that improves forecast accuracy and balances computational cost and performance. the model incorporates classes of predictive methods using individual selection approaches and an aggregate selection where the method with the best performance for a population of time series is determined and applied. a time series grouping technique was used due to the need to establish forecasts for more than one thousand skus, each one with demand characterized by an individual time series. time series' centroids obtained by grouping with the dtw (dynamic time warping) method were used to choose the best predictive method to be applied in each group. results of this approach were compared with the help of the chaid (chi-square automatic interaction detection) algorithm. the selection of the predictive method through the cluster centroids showed a reduction in the average forecast error of 16.7% compared to the current model. in addition, the average processing cost of the proposed model was only 2.1 seconds per sku, demonstrating that the selection of the predictive method for each cluster through the centroids proved to be an estimate with great application potential.",demand forecast,"The present work aimed to develop a retail demand forecasting model for the health and wellness sector that would improve prediction accuracy and be balanced in terms of computational cost and performance. Compared to the technique currently adopted, the proposed model was able to reduce the average forecast error by 16.7% when using the NRMSE metric. That said, it can be assumed that the developed model can increase the company's forecast accuracy. Furthermore, the average processing cost of the proposed model was only 2.09 seconds per SKU. Using the k-means algorithm with the DTW metric to form groups of products with similar historical behavior allowed to recover an average shape that mimics the shape of the cluster members. A computational cost 96.7% lower was obtained in the aggregate selection than in the individual, representing a significant saving of processing time. On the other hand, there was an increase of 9.5% in the average of the NRMSE. Despite the slight increase in the forecast error, the aggregate selection method was selected in the proposed model given the reduction in the computational cost. The results showed considerable reductions in the forecast error arising from the application of the proposed model. Thus, it can be considered that it is balanced in terms of computational cost and performance. Finally, it can be considered that, in general, a combination of time series clustering techniques with the aggregate selection approach allowed expressive reductions in computational cost without excessively increasing forecast error.","carlos ernani fries and vitor rodrigues department of production and systems engineering federal university of santa catarina florianópolis, sc, brazil carlos.fries@ufsc.br, vitorhgx@gmail.com",

377,Monitoring Multi-Attribute Characteristics Using A  Combined Scheme Of Np And Ewma Charts,"this paper proposes a new combined scheme (termed as mnp-ewma scheme) for monitoring multi-attribute characteristics. the proposed mnp-ewma scheme combines both the multi-attribute np (mnp) and multi-attribute exponentially weighted moving average (mewma) charts for effective monitoring fraction nonconforming. in this study, the average number of defectives (and) is used as an objective function in an optimization model to identify the best design variables of the proposed mnp-ewma scheme. the performance of the proposed mnp-ewma scheme is compared with that of the mnp and mewma charts under five scenarios with the different inputs of design specifications. the results show that the mnp-ewma chart outperforms the mnp and mewma charts under different settings.","control chart, quality control","This paper shows the design and implementation of a combined Mnp-EWMA scheme for monitoring multiple attributes. The proposed scheme is compared with the Mnp and MEWMA charts using the average number of defectives (AND) as an objective function to be minimized. The overall performance of the proposed Mnp-EWMA is examined and compared with Mnp & MEWMA control charts. The results of comparative study indicate that the proposed Mnp- EWMA scheme always performs better than the Mnp and MEWMA charts. For further optimization of the proposed Mnp-EWMA control chart, n and h might be involved in the optimization model as design variables in a future work.

The proposed algorithm tackles the uncertainty of booking/cancelation via two sequences phases. The first aims to schedule the waiting booking-list in minimum delivery time to increase the customers satisfaction by 21%, while the second phase makes an analysis for significant costs such as fixed, variable, shortage, and opportunity cost to satisfy the enterprise via increase their profit by 47%. the e-marketing has four variables that have impact relations such as time interval with minimum cost and service reliability with waiting time as illustrated in Figure. 16, the waiting time reduced by selecting the nearest suitable station for customers with respect to a minimum serviceable time and cost and increase utilization to achieve satisfaction to customers and enterprise via e-marketing processes.

384,An Understanding Of The Food Chain System In Malaysia: A  Mini-Review Approach,"the socio-food-flow system focuses on the structure of mental models, which can assist in recognising social systems and human structures as well as determining their knowledge and views about the level of comprehension of the food- chain system. qualitative methods like face-to-face and online interviews, cognitive mapping, and even image interpretation, are used to create the mental model method. it is also assisted using quantitative approaches for the goal of obtaining more accurate and relevant data, such as questionnaires, so that the results acquired cannot be challenged by any researcher. in addition, the researchers are carrying out a literature review over the next five years abroad, from 2015 to 2021. as a result of the study’s findings, most researchers prefer to discuss food-related research in the context of food health and safety, while others prefer to discuss it in the context of food treatment technology. this is supported by the findings of previous studies conducted by researchers, in which 13 journals were reviewed from indexed sources such as sciencedirect and scopus from 2015 to 2021. this study could be used to remind the whole community of the food chain system’s relevance for improving product quality and reducing the environmental impact of production. the conceptual approach of the model can assist researchers in increasing public awareness of the relevance of the food chain system in the future.","mental models, sustainability, food chain systems, knowledge","The Food Chain System is a distribution network that is inextricably linked to logistics and comes in a variety of sociocultural, economic, and environmental configurations. The food chain system’s conservation is critical for preventing the degradation of soil, water, air, and human health resources. The food chain system serves as a benchmark for evaluating a country’s food supply network’s performance in light of factors such as perishable food sources, seasonal food production, and the availability of high-quality and sufficient food sources, as well as transportation and processing facilities for food products, to meet consumer needs. Understanding the behaviour and the comprehension of human agents is critical in the food chain system due to their relevance to changing consumption patterns of current food sources. Consequently, authorities place a high priority on efficient governance of food chain systems in order to address the issue of excess or reduced food supply and ensure future sustainability. Previous research has demonstrated the inability of concerned parties to focus on simultaneous cognitive thinking across the overall food chain system. Thus, bridging the gap through the consolidation of multiple objectives and cross- disciplinary food systems through the use of mental models is a more pertinent and ideal solution that adheres to the Sustainable Development Agenda Acknowledgement This work was supported with funding from the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS) Phase1-2020 with vote number 59644.","siti aishah mohd zakuan, latifah abdul ghani, zikri muhammad, jumadil saputra faculty of business, economics and social development universiti malaysia terengganu 21030 kuala nerus, terengganu, malaysia aishahzakuan14@gmail.com.my; latifah.ghani@umt.edu.my; zikri@umt.edu.my; jumadil.saputra@umt.edu.my abdul talib bon department of production and operations universiti tun hussein onn malaysia 86400 parit raja, johor malaysia talibon@gmail.com",
385,Recyclable Materials Flows In Municipal Solid Waste  System In Terengganu: An Application Of Material Flow,"municipal solid waste covers 64% of the overall waste composition in malaysia. the highest waste found in the municipal solid waste was household waste, from which 70-80% of the total waste consisted of recyclable materials disposed at the landfills. solid waste management which focuses on the recovery potential of recyclable materials found at the landfills helps in restoring environment by reducing the volume of waste at the landfills, and by improving economic market of recyclable materials. thus, this study aims to identify the value of input and output flows of recyclable materials in municipal solid waste (msw) system at the generation, collection and transportation, separation, and final disposal phase. the application of material flow analysis (mfa) was suitable as the supporting tool in order to visualize the flows of the recyclable materials throughout the four phases in the msw system. the primary data for the mfa were obtained from field observation, in-depth interviews and literature review, covering eight districts of terengganu. the results showed that the highest input flow of recyclables materials in the msw system was from household waste flow. the total flow of recyclable materials was 1.54 kilotonnes per year while the output flow of recyclable materials being recycled was only 6.92 kilotonnes per year from the overall flow of the system. it is suggested that the partnership between private sectors and local authority should also involve intensive promotion of the 3rs activities to encourage recycling activities among people in terengganu.",,"The total input and output flow of recyclable materials in MSW system could be calculated and visually presented by using STAN-MFA. The MSW has a good potential to recover recyclable materials. Hence, the authority should emphasize in waste minimization and improving recycling. The task of recycling was mostly taken by scavengers, and this should be supported actively by households by practicing separation at the sources. In order to improve the highlighted issues, the proposed recommendation can be considered by the local authority to achieve a sustainable solid waste management.

386,Social Impact Of Small Seawater Desalination Plant Of Local  Community: A Social Life Cycle Assessment,"apart from malaysia being supplied with and having abundance of water resources, the country is also experiencing increasing problems concerning water resources. kampong pantai senok, bachok is one of the affected areas in kelantan that are having issues with immoderate amounts of water consumption, unsatisfactory services by the water company due to rapid social and economic growth. therefore, a small seawater desalination plant is installed to address these issues. the objective of this study is to identify the potential social impact associated with stakeholder participation, which is the local community, using social life cycle assessment (s-lca) as a methodology. in s- lca, the methodology very much resembles the life cycle assessment (lca) framework and both assessments gave phases of procedures, which are goal and scope definitions, the life cycle inventory (lci), the life cycle impact assessment (lcia) and interpretation. a set of questionnaires was developed using the selected sub-categories proposed by unep (2009) to be accessed by the stakeholders (local community). the results showed positive social impacts for the local community, as satisfaction is high for the sub-categories involved.","social impact, local community","As a conclusion, the assessment on social impacts from the life cycle of the seawater desalination process in this study has identified a few social aspects which requires improvements for the local community. The seawater desalination process activities influence the society nearby. Most of the local community had good opinions on the installation of the seawater desalination plant. The social aspects derived from S-LCA satisfied the requirements in terms of social significance. However, there are some improvements needed on the sub-categories of job opportunities for the local community. Programme and training can be provided to some local communities that have the qualifications required to contribute to local employment opportunities. Other research can be done for the rest of the seawater desalination process to get the overall potential social impact as this study only focused on three life cycle phases. The results of the study will help the plant management to reduce any negative social impacts and upgrade the efficiency of the drinking water production.

With the abilities possessed and how lecturers create good relationships with students, it will significantly affect how the campus life environment is created, which will impact the development of the University in the future. As a teaching staff, of course, individuals must have adequate abilities, not only in terms of intellectual (Intelligent Quotient) but also in terms of emotional management (Emotional Quotient) and creativity in teaching. This study explores the influence of intelligent quotient and emotional quotient on lecturer performance mediated by creativity. The results show that the intelligence quotient has a significant positive effect on lecturer performance. This shows that the higher the IQ intelligence possessed by a lecturer, the better the performance. In recruiting lecturers at universities, of course, specific academic qualifications must be met. Lecturers who are recruited are, of course, lecturers who have good academic qualifications, and preferably those who already have teaching experience. These results are consistent with previous research, which explained that the intelligence aspect has a somewhat important role in predicting the performance of employees. The second result shows that the emotional quotient has a significant positive effect on lecturer performance. This illustrates that the aspect of emotional management is also an essential factor that can have an impact on the resulting performance. Emotional management here involves the process of a lecturer in building good relationships with students and co-workers. This, of course, makes the work environment, both the relationship between lecturers and students and the relationship between lecturers and colleagues, more positive. The aspect of creativity also plays an essential role in supporting the performance of lecturers. Creativity is proven to mediate the relation-ship between intelligence quotient and lecturer performance.

Because more increasing Return on Assets (ROA) of a company, the greater the level of profit achieved and the better the position of the company in terms of the use of assets so as to increase the value of the company. Firm size has no effect on firm value. Because the size of the company will not affect the size of the company's value. No matter how big the company is when there are rumors that the company is experiencing losses and is on the verge of bankruptcy, investors will automatically not invest in the company. So the size of the company cannot affect the value of the company. Profitability has a positive effect on firm value with dividend policy able to be used as a moderating variable. This is because companies with a high level of profitability have a greater opportunity to pay dividends with a greater value to shareholders. So that the dividend policy is able to strengthen the influence of profitability on firm value. Firm size has no effect on firm value. Dividend policy cannot be used as a moderating variable. Because the larger the company uses debt, the company tends to pay dividends in smaller amounts because the profits obtained from the debt are first paid to creditors along with the interest costs which of course will affect investors' perceptions of the value of the company and make dividend policy by distributing dividends. unable to moderate the effect of firm size on firm value.

411,The Winner’S Curse As A Driver Of Cost Overruns In Public  Construction Projects,"in this study we collect data from 148 public tenders of medium and large construction projects. in these projects, the tender issuing body is a public agency that also estimates the true cost of the project before the bidding process begins. bids are publicly open to contractors that meet certain criteria, and the lowest bid wins the contract. construction is supervised by project managers employed by the public agency. for each project, we computed the average bid as the average of all the valid bids. the mean of the average bids was almost identical to the mean estimated cost. this result is known as the wisdom of the crowds. since the winning bid is the lowest valid bid, by corollary of the wisdom of the crowds it also implies the winner’s curse. on average, the winning bid was 8% lower than the estimate cost. however, the actual payments to the contractor were, on average 16% greater than the estimated cost. these cost overruns imply a pendulum swing, i.e, that the winning contractor is able to pendulate their loss into a gain. indeed, that fact that construction projects are beleaguered with cost overruns is well known. researchers and practitioners have tried numerous ways to explain the causes for cost overruns and explore ways to prevent them. for the particular case of a public agency that employs project managers who interact with the winning contractor, we argue that the motivation for cost overruns can be explained using a game theory model that describes the interaction between the project managers and the winning contractor. the current workplace culture as well as the tender method results with an outcome that leads to cost overruns to the detriment of the public. by expanding the game to include the public agency as a first mover player, we show how the combination of changing both the workplace culture and the tender method can result in a second period game between the project managers and the contractors with an equilibrium outcome that is more beneficial to the public. proceedings of the international conference on industrial engineering and operations management monterrey, mexico, november 3-5, 2021 © ieom society international 3362",,,"yahel giat department of industrial engineering, jerusalem college of technology. amichai mitelman department of civil engineering, ariel university.",

415,Control Of Rebar Waste Rate Using Building Information  Modelling : A Case Study Of Suspended Road Structure,"rebar materials are one of the major construction materials in a construction process that generate main contribution of construction and demolition (c&d) wastage. therefore, a monitoring and controlling process as a part of waste management in design, procurement and construction phases is obligatory. this paper presents a model for a rate calculation of rebar waste in the construction phase based on realtime progress by blending output from building information modelling (bim) quantity takeoff software in the form of the report of total volume steel reinforcement and that of current rebar volume based on the existing progress to monitor spreadsheet to perform the rate calculation of real time and exact rebar waste. simulation and “what if” scenario were applied to this proposed calculation model. for a 40% progress of the suspended road structure project, the proposed calculation model partakes 4,02% rebar waste rate. this result validates that the model can produce rebar waste rate based on the exisiting project progress.","waste rate, rebar","The objective of this paper was to extend BIM function as waste management collaborative tools for rebar waste control and management in construction phase. Generally, the proposed model of calculation is successful and validated by a case study. The model was effective in providing the calculation of the real time rebar waste rate so the project team could monitor and control waste rate in the field. This proposed calculation model also offers the stakeholders more options and assistance in decision making processes and evaluating the rebar production in more productive and quick manners through BIM, especially for a crash program project with no detailed plan on rebar shape schedule. The present study, however, was unable to calculate the length of extended rebar lap in the edge of latest concrete that makes the model a little less accurate. This study may be applicable to a single floor infrastructure; thus, a further study could develop the proposed model in more complex types of constructions such as building constructions.","ryan faza prasetyo, darmawan pontan universitas trisakti, jl. kyai tapa no.1, jakarta barat, dki jakarta , indonesia ryan@trisakti.ac.id, darmawan@trisakti.ac.id",
416,"The Determinants Of Electronic Medical Record  Satisfaction: Communication Styles, Computer Efficacy And","electronic medical record (emr) satisfaction in hospitals is very important to understand. this is related in how far doctors will use it. there are many factors that can affect the internal satisfaction of erm. some of them are communication styles, computer efficacy and competencies. this research seeks to analyze how far communication style, computer efficacy and competencies affect internal satisfaction of electronic medical record services. location of this research was conducted in one of the hospitals in surabaya, indonesia. the method used is multiple linear regression analysis. sample collection involve 30 doctors from general clinics. the results show that communication style, computer efficacy and competency have a positive and significant effect on internal satisfaction with electronic medical record services, either partially or simultaneously. computer efficacy are the most dominant factor in influencing emr satisfaction. this research is expected to be used as input for hospital management to focus on emr satisfaction by improving doctor’s communication styles, computer efficacy and competencies. if these three factors continue to be improved, especially in computer efficacy for example through training, then emr satisfaction at hospital will also increase.","satisfaction, communication, computer, efficacy","From this research, several conclusions can be formulated. Partially there is a positive and significant influence of communication style on internal satisfaction of EMR services. There is also an influence of computer efficacy on internal satisfaction of EMR services positively and significantly. Partially there is an influence of competency on internal satisfaction of EMR services positively and significantly. Simultaneously there is a positive and significant influence on the variables of communication style, computer efficacy and competency on internal satisfaction of EMR services. This shows that simultaneously all independent variables have a significant effect on the dependent variable. Communication style affects the internal satisfaction of EMR services, so that satisfaction with EMR services can be increased by increasing the use of communication media in the form of coordination groups related to EMR services. Whenever there are technical problems or administrative problems related to the disruption of EMR services, doctors can inform the group and these problems can be handled together quickly. Not only that, the Change Management Department at the hospital can also provide reminders about good communication tips, culture and hospital motto for the service department, especially medical personnel and doctors. Computer Efficacy affect the internal satisfaction of EMR services, so that satisfaction with EMR services can be increased by continuing to carry out socialization activities related to how to use and troubleshoot EMR applications by IT units. In addition to socialization, hospital can also regularly conduct webinars on IT-related topics for employees, including doctors. With these routine activities, the computer efficacy for doctors will increase. Competency affects internal satisfaction of EMR services, so that satisfaction with EMR services can be increased by establishing a communication forum between internal doctors that aims to discuss scientifically with each other. Human Capital Department of the hospital can also provide training for employees, especially doctors to improve competency and implement a workplace rotation system to provide new experiences or handle new cases so that doctors are encouraged to continue to improve their competencies. Based on the results of the study, the adjusted R2 value was 0.426, this means that the variation in satisfaction can be explained by variations in the independent variables of communication style, computer efficacy and competency of 42.6 percent. While the remaining 57.4 percent is explained by other reasons outside the model. From the remaining percentage obtained, it can provide the opportunity for further researchers to examine what other aspects can affect the internal satisfaction of EMR services apart from communication style factors, computer efficacy and competency.","competency erwin pramastya sabatini, reswanda, joko suyono narotama university, surabaya, indonesia erwin.sabatini@gmail.com; rewanda@narotama.ac.id; joko.suyono@narotama.ac.id damarsari ratnasahara elisabeth stie mahardhika surabaya, surabaya, indonesia damarsariarizona@gmail.com sukaris university of muhammadiyah gresik",

2. Companies must be more careful in planning activities to reduce operating costs without having an impact on 
decreasing loading and unloading productivity. 
3. Calculations for operating cost planning consider the distribution of containers and the productivity of unloading 
work so that the total operating costs do not occur. 
4. The company must also be firm in implementing the rules for the distribution of containers, especially regarding 
the rules regarding the shortage of shipping fleets in loading and unloading, so shipments must receive their 
unloaded containers first in the field to facilitate loading and unloading activities. 
5. For further research, it is hoped that someone will examine how the distribution of containers can be optimized 
to obtain maximum profit for the company, not only to increase work productivity.

418,Effect Of Operator Performance And Effectiveness  Unloading Equipment On Container Handling At Terminal,"terminal domestic containers is one of the companies that engaged in port services. to increase handling effectiveness, reliable operator performance and equipment readiness are required. the type of research used is associative research with a quantitative approach. the population in this study are equipment operators who work at terminal on domestic container while the samples taken are 80 operators. the type of data used in this research is quantitative. sources of data used obtained primary data. data collection techniques were carried out by distributing questionnaires. the analysis technique used is multiple linear regression analysis. the results of this study indicate that (1) operator performance has a partial significant effect on container handling. (2) loading and unloading equipment has a significant effect on container handling.","unloading, equipments, container","So that the independent variable operator performance (X1) has a significant partial effect on container handling (Y) b. Formulation of hypothesis for t-test (partial) on variable loading and unloading equipment (X2): 1) H0 : β2 = 0 H1 : β2 ≠ 0 or H0 : The independent variable loading and unloading equipment (X2) has no partial significant effect on loading and unloading equipment (Y). H1 : The independent variable loading and unloading equipment (X2) has a significant partial effect on container handling (Y). c. If the significance value of the independent variable loading and unloading (X2) in the t-test sig <0.05 or t- count> t-table, then there is an effect of variable X on variable Y. If the value of sig> 0.05 or t-count < t table then there is no the effect of variable X on Y. Based on Table 4.18 the analysis of the T test is the magnitude of the value of tcount on the variable loading and unloading equipment (X2) is 15.997 with a significance of 0.000. Because 15.997>1.990 and 0.000 <0.05, it shows that H0 is rejected. Conclusion: So that the independent variable loading and unloading equipment (X2) has a partial significant effect on container handling (Y). 5.4 Discussion 5.4 1 Effect of operator performance on container handling Based on the hypothesis testing using the partial test (t test), the results show that the operator's performance (X1) has an influence on container handling (Y). This can be seen from the significance value on the t-test of the operator performance variable (X1) of 0.000 or less than the significance level (α) of 0.05 and Tcount > Ttable of 4.535> 1.990. Based on this, the first hypothesis which reads ""It is suspected that there is a partial effect of operator performance on container handling"" is proven true and can be declared accepted. The results of the analysis show that there is an effect of operator performance on container handling, meaning that the better the operator performance formed by Terminal on Domestic Container, the higher the container handling will be. In other words, operator performance can be shaped by the handling of containers built by Terminal on Domestic Container. 5.4.2 Effect of Loading and Unloading Equipment on Container Handling Based on the hypothesis testing using the partial test (t test) it is found that loading and unloading equipment (X2) has an influence on container handling (Y). This can be seen from the significance value of the t-test of the loading and unloading equipment variable (X2) of 0.000 or less than the significance level (α) of 0.05 and Tcount > Ttable of 15.997 > 1.990. Based on this, the second hypothesis which reads ""It is suspected that there is a partial effect of unloading equipment on the handling of containers at Terminal on Domestic Container "" is proven to be true and can be accepted. There is a partial effect if the performance of operators and loading and unloading with positive and significant performance. This means that the performance of the operator and equipment that is dismantled has a unidirectional relationship, then the performance of the operator and unloading equipment will increase or it can be said that there is no problem. (Journal of Magister Management Vol. 2 No 1, March 2016 35-68 ) by Amril1, Jerry M Logahan. 6. Conclusions Based on the results of research and discussion in the previous chapter, several conclusions can be drawn to answer the formulation of the problem. Some of these conclusions consist of: (1) Operator performance has a significant partial effect on container handling of Terminal on Domestic Container, with a significance less than 0.05. Thus, the first hypothesis which reads ""It is suspected that there is a partial effect of operator performance on container handling at Terminal on Domestic Container"" is proven to be true and can be declared accepted, (2) Loading and unloading equipment has a partial significant effect on container handling at Terminal on Domestic Container, with a significance less than 0.05. Thus the second hypothesis which reads ""It is suspected that there is a partial effect of loading and unloading equipment on container handling at Terminal on Domestic Container"" is proven to be true and can be declared accepted.

438,Bali Government Support To Blowed Up Tourism,"this study aims to describe the support provided by the bali provincial government to increase tourism activities in the area. this study uses a descriptive qualitative approach, which is a qualitative study that aims to describe the problems discussed. the problem discussed is the support provided by the bali government to redevelop tourism activities which are constrained by the covid 19 pandemic outbreak. the research data used include primary data and secondary data. primary data was obtained through interviews and direct observations in the field, while secondary data was obtained from the documentation. the government has established five main programs to support tourism development in bali after the pandemic. the five programs are work from bali (wfb), provision of grant funds for tourism recovery, providing relaxation to the tourism sector, travel bubble plan, strengthening the capacity of 3t (testing, tracing, and treatment), implementation of accelerated vaccination. bali, which is heavily on the tourism sector, needs to open up other sectors that are still attached to balinese society, such as agriculture, trade, and fishing. the community is given the understanding to slowly return to opening up business opportunities in other sectors so that the economy does not continue to experience long-term problems. however, this does not necessarily leave the tourism sector. this is the right time to improve yourself in the provision of knowledge, add skills and education to continuously yourself so that later it will be ready when the tourism sector is open and normal again. keyword: bali government support, tourism, work from bali, 3t (testing, tracing, and treatment), travel bubble plan 1. introduction bali was named the first best destination in the world-beating london according to the 2021 travelers' choice awards and one of the top tourism wish lists in 2020. it gives confidence that the existence of bali in the world of tourism has received international recognition. bali tourism has grown and developed in such a way as to make a major contribution to the development of the area and the balinese people, either directly or indirectly (purwahita et al. 2021). proceedings of the international conference on industrial engineering and operations management monterrey, mexico, november 3-5, 2021 © ieom society international 3555",,"This study aims to determine the support provided by the government to increase tourism activities on the island of Bali. The current condition of Bali is the worst in the history of tourism in Bali. The tourism sector and almost all sectors related to the tourism industry were significantly affected. The affected sectors are travel agencies, hotels, restaurants, souvenirs center stores, transportation (land, sea, and air), and tourism employees. The government has also given an appealed to the tourism industry players to implement seven strategies in the current pandemic conditions, such as high standard sanitation, high standard security, staycation, niche tourism, solo travel tour, wellness tour, and virtual tourism. The government has established five main programs to support tourism development in Bali after the pandemic. The five programs are Work From Bali (WFB), provision of grant funds for tourism recovery, providing relaxation to the tourism sector, travel bubble plan, strengthening the capacity of 3T (testing, tracing, and treatment), implementation of accelerated vaccination. The recovery of Bali tourism includes 3 stages consisting of 6 main strategies or quick wins that must be immediately implemented by all stakeholders in the effort to restore the Bali economy involved, such preparation stage, transition stage, and recovery stages. Bali, which is heavily on the tourism sector, needs to open up other sectors that are still attached to Balinese society, such as agriculture, trade, and fishing. The community is given the understanding to slowly return to opening up business opportunities in other sectors so that the economy does not continue to experience long-term problems. However, this does not necessarily leave the tourism sector. This is the right time to improve yourself in the provision of knowledge, add skills and education to continuously yourself so that later it will be ready when the tourism sector is open and normal again. The social sector is closely related to continuing to apply health protocols according to government recommendations; changing life habits to be healthier, cleaner, and stay active. Furthermore, the environmental sector emphasizes the community, tourists, and tourism actors to increase awareness of maintaining and preserving nature, so that it can be utilized, not only for now but also in the future.

439,Antiosteoporotic Activity Of Pandanus Odoratissimus Seed  Extract In Ovariectomized Rats,"osteoporosis often called “silent diseases” of aging because bone loss occurs without symptoms, untuil microarchitectural deterioration and bone fractures occurs. the common therapy to prevent the estrogen degrading condition is hormon replacement therapy (hrt). however, hrt possessed various risks. recent studies suggest the phytoestrogens may exert a protective effect against osteoporosis. this study examined whether treatment with phytoestrogen extract from pandanus odoratissimus seed (ps) exerted a preventive effect on estrogen deficiency induced osteoporosis. three months old female sprague dawley rats were randomly assigned into either a sham operated group or one of five variectomy (ovx) groups, negative control, positive control (with allendronate) and ovx with ps extract. rats began receiving treatment 20 days after the ovx and receiving treatment for 28 days after ovx. the results showed that ps (900mg/kb bw) treatment prevented decrease in trabecular density while also preventing an increase in trabecular separation and ps 900 mg/kg bw had the smallest proportion of osteoclast to osteoblast, compare to other treatment. the result of this study demonstrated that the potential effects of pandanus odoratissimus seed extract (ps 900mg/kg bw) as herbal drug. therefore it is suggested that pandanus odoratissimus seed extract might be a potential alternative therapy for treating postmenopausal osteoporosis.","osteoporosis, trabecular density","To sum up, oxidative stress may promote the development of osteoporosis, and antioxidants such as Pandanus odoratissimus seed extract can mitigate the progress of osteoporosis. Nevertheless, we made this conclusion based on the rat model of osteoporosis and Pandanus odoratissimus seed extract should be evaluated for adverse as well as beneficial effects in clinical trials. In addition, the specific mechanism of oxidative stress in osteoporosis should be further investigated.

Strengthening technological literacy in Bogor City Junior High Schools implements elements of communication and collaboration which consist of three components of individual competence, namely use skills, critical understanding, and communicative abilities. Communication and collaboration is an element of technological literacy in the form of active participation in learning activities carried out by utilizing technological literacy applications. The use of technological literacy applications in learning activities at Bogor City Junior High Schools is one of the models for strengthening technological literacy. The existence of technological literacy makes junior high school teachers required to master new media so that they can indirectly improve their individual technological literacy skills. The contribution of this research is a model of strengthening technological literacy through the use of technological literacy in Bogor City Junior High Schools. Research on technological literacy in Bogor City Junior High Schools needs to be done to analyze the other six elements of technological literacy. Research recommendations are also intended for policy makers in Bogor City Junior High Schools to maximize the use of Technology Literacy Applications as an effort to strengthen technological literacy, especially in the communication and collaboration elements Acknowledgements Thank you to the Directorate of Research and Community Service, Directorate General of Research and Development of the Ministry of Research, Technology and Higher Education for funding this program through the National Competitive Research grant program in 2021.

Education certainly is significantly correlated with development. Successful development depends on the quality of human resources; no development without qualified human resources and, vice versa, no quality human resources without development in education. Education is a vital aspect of nation-building. Therefore, almost all nations place education development as a top priority in national development programs. Quality human resources, which are educational products, are the key to the success of a country's development. YAPIS, an Islamic Education Foundation engaged in education founded by government employees and assigned to Papua in 1968, becomes a strategic partner of the government in advancing the people of Papua through education.

454,Generating Artificial Driving Patterns By Using Generative  Adversarial Networks,"a driving pattern (dp) describes how drivers drive in a given region. the dps are obtained by monitoring a representative sample of vehicles traveling on roads of different characteristics and under normal conditions. a driving cycle (dc), on the other hand, is a speed time series that represent the dp, and it is used to assess the performance in energy consumption and tailpipe emissions of the vehicles. the construction of a dc consists in obtaining a speed time series whose characteristic parameters (cp*s) are similar to the characteristic parameters of the driving pattern (cps). the cps are variables derived from speed and time, such as the mean speed and mean acceleration. the methods to construct dc (micro-trips, markov chains, and mwd-cp) are well-known and established. however, challenges remain with respect to the repeatability of their results, the need for a large number of measured trips, which is highly expensive and time-consuming. this work presents an alternative and novel approach to construct artificial dc representing dps using a few measured trips and a deep learning (dl) model called generative adversarial networks (gan). a gan combines two dl architectures: the generator and the discriminator. the generator creates candidate artificial dc as similar as possible to the real trips, while the discriminator distinguishes between real and artificial dc. therefore, a competition is triggered between the generator and discriminator, resulting in a generator capable of creating representative candidate artificial dc. for instance, the generator looks after: i) to minimize loss functions which are the relative differences between cps of the artificial dc and of the driving patterns, and ii) to maximize the failure of the discriminator. in addition, the resulting model can be used to obtain dcs from other cities using transfer learning techniques. transfer learning consists of reusing a well- trained and validated model in a similar application by adjusting only the model parameters. as a case example, we collected second by second data of speed, fuel consumption, and tailpipe pollutants, obtained monitoring for two months, a sample of 16 vehicles operating in mexico city. a gan was trained for constructing artificial but representative dc of 20 minutes duration with a resolution of 1 hz. we used that gan to construct 10000 representative dc and found that in all cases, the dcs exhibit cp*s within the 10% of the relative difference with respect to the corresponding 19 cps that describe the dp, fuel consumption, and tailpipe emissions. according to the literature, 10% of the relative difference is an acceptable criterion for this purpose. similar results were observed applying transfer learning to data from bogota, colombia. proceedings of the international conference on industrial engineering and operations management monterrey, mexico, november 3-5, 2021 © ieom society international 3694",,,"fannia pacheco department of mechanical and electrical engineering university of southern denmark, sdu sonderborg, 6400, denmark fpacheco@sdu.dk mariela cerrada research and development group on industrial technologies (gidtec) universidad politécnica salesiana cuenca, 010105, ecuador mcerrada@ups.edu.ec josé ignacio huertas energy and climate change research group school of engineering and science, tecnológico de monterrey monterrey, 64849, mexico jhuertas@tec.mx",
455,An Investigation Of Open Career Promotion Policy  Implementation In Indonesian National Police Institution,"the competence of human resources among the indonesian national police (polri) is believed to be a critical factor in determining the success of the polri organization. therefore, polri has implemented an open position promotion program, one of which uses the assessment center to test managerial competence. in addition, the national police assessment center is used to support the policy of the national police chief in promoting open positions at every level and office space in his jurisdiction following the delegation of authority. this study investigates the policies and impacts of the assessment center implementation in supporting the promotion of open positions. the study used a qualitative approach by applying observation as the data collecting technique, interview, and documents study. the result indicated that implementing the assessment center encourages the opening of career promotion. however, in a more extensive sense, the implementation of the assessment center is encouraging the opening of career promotion has not been successful and does not have a positive impact. it could happen because the indonesian national police, as a bureaucratic organization, does not have the capacity of organization as the bureaucracy's breadwinner, which involves the organization's structure, working mechanism, human resources, financial support, and the resources required for working. therefore, those four elements are still not able to optimize the condition and encourage each other. in conclusion, this study has successfully investigated the success of policy implementation of open career promotion in the indonesian national police institution. in a narrow sense is by looking at the compliance of implementing the policies contained in policy documents (laws, regulations, and programs) and following the existing standard operating procedures (sop).",,,"albertus recky robertho, hardi warsono and augustin rina herwati faculty of social and political sciences universitas diponegoro tembalang, semarang, jawa tengah 50275, indonesia albertusreckyrobertho@gmail.com, hardiwarsono@lecturer.undip.ac.id, rinahera1508@gmail.com jumadil saputra faculty of business, economics and social development universiti malaysia terengganu 21030 kuala nerus, terengganu, malaysia jumadil.saputra@umt.edu.my",

It matters because the starting point of planning carries out the stages of implementing a program. This planning is important because it underlies the next step, where all indicators are planned to implement sustainable development. The most important thing in implementing this stage is stakeholder involvement in dealing with slum settlements. The slum upgrading program is developed for cultural heritage tourism in Pulau Penyengat. The program uses the Penta helix concept with five elements: academics, government, community, business or private sector, and media. It is classified on the level of stakeholder's interest and primary stakeholders such as central government, provincial government, city government, and local community; secondary stakeholders that is academics, Tourism Awareness Group (Pokdarwis), and media, as well as can be modified into key stakeholders regarding their highest level of interest and influence or power. The key stakeholders of the slum upgrading program in Pulau Penyengat are the Center for Regional Settlement Infrastructure of Kepulauan Riau Province, Regional Planning, Research, and Development Agency of Kepulauan Riau Province, and Tanjungpinang Regional Planning, Research and Development Agency, where the collaboration was marked with the drafting of Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the three key stakeholders representing each government institution. Each stakeholder has its level of influence and interest. The key stakeholders act as regulators and controllers to function as the leader of planning, implementation, and monitoring of activities. The local community is an accelerator, business, or private sector. It performs as an enabler to support the program through the funding, academics play the role of conception by contributing concepts and ideas for development through research, and media acts as an expanded by promoting, publishing, and creating an image of Pulau Penyengat as an island rich in cultural heritage. The roles of stakeholders do not identify and form a collaborative relationship in the Penta Helix concept following their respective roles in the slum upgrading program. However, relationships among the stakeholders such as coordinating, networking, and collaborating could avert conflicts of interest and make it easier to determine who should be involved in the development or who needs improvement so that the program's implementation will run fluently.","surjadi, hardi warsono and augustin rina herwati faculty of social and political sciences universitas diponegoro tembalang, semarang, jawa tengah 50275, indonesia surjadi@student.undip.ac.id , hardiwarsono@lecturer.undip.ac.id, augustinrina@lecturer.undip.ac.id jumadil saputra faculty of business, economics and social development universiti malaysia terengganu 21030 kuala nerus, terengganu, malaysia jumadil.saputra@umt.edu.my abdul talib bon department of production and operations universiti tun hussein onn malaysia 86400 parit raja, johor malaysia talibon@gmail.com",

491,Building Information Modeling (Bim) Implementation  Model For Facility Management,"the management of a building facility will begin after the construction of a building is completed and submitted to the owner of the building. it is an ongoing process for the cycle of a building. the main purpose is to ensure that the function of all facilities in the building can run optimally such as equipment, space, furniture, and others so that if the management and maintenance of all facilities in a building / building are not done properly, correctly, and scheduled will cause many problems, especially for the owner and manager of the building. so that all facilities in the building/building must always be maintained and maintained so that it is always in good condition and not damaged. because if negligent in the maintenance process it will be able to cause losses for the owner and building. judging from the background above, at this time there is a technology that can help in the management of existing facilities, namely bim (building information modelling) technology. building information modelling (bim) is required as one solution to provide information, geometric models, and information about the interests (rights, limitations, and obligations) attached to building objects. three- dimensional geometric models can be obtained through a system-using approach to building information modelling (bim), as they are considered feasible and have the potential ability to model three-dimensional ownership rights. the three-dimensional framework of the building can be obtained from modeling from autodesk revit software (one of the wearable software). the application of bim methods in 3d (three- dimensional) integration, provides information directly related to assets, building utility systems, as well as other information such as type, dimensions, and other semantic information attached to permodelan created. the collection of attributes of the 3d model can be used as information for facility management needs as well as information that supports the management of facilities such as asset management/inventory of space/building and standardization in the management of facilities based on building information modelling (bim).","maintenance, assets","AND SUGGESTIONS 5.1. CONCLUSION Based on the research that has been done, BIM technology is widely discussed and thoroughly researched only at the planning, design, and construction stages. While in the stage of managing existing facilities in the framework of maintenance and others BIM technology is still considered a new field. Understanding, challenges, and the potential added value of BIM technology for Facility Management is very large, so to explore this requires literature studies and case studies, especially those we conducted in this research, which through this research is expected to provide solutions for the management of this Facility Management. This research provides evidence that the potential of BIM Technology for Facility Management is very necessary, this is mainly derived from 3D Modeling produced through BIM technology so that it can provide information that can be used for the management of Facility Management so that all sets of attributes/codes or 3D models produced can be used to support the management activities of facilities in the Building/building. So that there will be a management of building facilities based on Building Information Modelling (BIM). 5.2. SUGGESTION However, some challenges inhibit the exploitation of BIM in Facility Management, the main challenges include: 1. Lack of understanding and knowledge methodologies that show the real benefits of Building Information Modelling (BIM) technology in Facility Management, which is reflected in the lack of demand and use of bim technology for facility management by building owners/building managers. 2. Limited knowledge of the requirements for the application of BIM to Facility Management (e.g. what information will be provided, when and by whom); Lack of open systems, standardization that can be used as a bridge between BIM technology and Facility Management. 3. The lack of roles, responsibilities, and clear frameworks for bim management, as well as the lack of skills of managers and stakeholders to use bim technology in the management of facilities management, and there are still many rigid industrial culture approaches to adopting new processes and technologies. The development of BIM specifications and technologies for the management of Facility Management that suits the needs of each organization is identified as a key factor for utilizing bim technology-based facility management and enabling the organization and its supply chain to work by structured Facility Management processes. BIM technology for Facility Management must meet the requirements of the building owner, meaning that managers need to understand and articulate the BIM requirements including the level of detail required. The different ages of technology, as well as buildings, indicate that there are standard technological requirements that need to be considered. The results presented in this paper add contributions that can be used by researchers/practitioners to develop BIM methodologies and technologies for facility management that can later meet the needs of each building manager/organization that suits their individual needs because this is very important for the successful implementation of BIM and Facility Management.

493,"Analysis Of Quality Of Service, Price And Product Quality To  Purchase Decisions In Pt. Japfa Sidoarjo","the problem of purchasing decisions by consumers is based on several things that are no less important. because the purchase decision is the initial door for the company to prove that the product offered is a quality product with a level of service that satisfies consumers. talking about purchasing decisions, the company should be able to know the factors that motivate consumers so that they can decide to buy a product. the data used in this study is quantitative by using multiple linear regression analysis of the finite population, namely all customers of pt. japfa who made transactions at pt. japfa, which amounted to 55 respondents. research in the form of a survey is used to obtain data from customers of pt. japfa is natural (not artificial), but the researchers carried out treatments in data collection, by distributing questionnaires and structured interviews. the results showed that the service, price, and product quality simultaneously had a significant effect on the purchasing decisions of pt. japfa is the most dominant influence on consumer purchasing decisions pt. japfa is a price variable.","service, price, quality, consumer decisions","Based on the results of data analysis and discussions that have been carried out, the conclusions that can be drawn from the research are as follows: 1) The variables of service quality, price, and product quality simultaneously have a significant effect on purchasing decisions of PT. japfa. This is by the proof of the hypothesis in the previous chapter, which is evidenced by the results of calculations using the multiple linear regression method where the R square (R2) number is 0.816 or 81.60% which shows the contribution or contribution of the service quality variable (X1), price (X2) and product quality (X3) together or simultaneity on purchasing decisions (Y) is very strong. While the rest (100% - 81.60% = 18.40%) was contributed by other variables that were not taken into account in the study. And the results of these calculations are also supported by the results of the f test which states that the calculated F value is 75,400. Then based on the table value, it is known that the F table in DF (3:51:0.05) is 2,786 so the calculated F is greater than the F table. Furthermore, from the significance level, it is known that the significance value of 0.000 is far below the number (α = 5%) indicating the effect of service quality (X1), price (X2), and product quality (X3) together on purchasing decisions (Y) is significant. So that in terms of policy determination about purchasing decisions, management should use the variables that exist in the current study. 2) The variables of service quality, price, and product quality partially all have a significant effect on customer satisfaction of PT. Animal Feed As evidenced by the t-count for the service quality variable (X1), the t-count value is 2.197 > t-table 2.006. The second for the price variable is shown t-count for the price variable (X2) shows the t-count value 2.568 < t-table 2.006 and the third for the product quality variable is indicated by the results of the t-count calculation for the price variable (X2) shows the t-value. The count for the product quality variable (X3) shows the t-count value of 2,277 > t-table of 2,006. 3) Among the 4 independent variables studied which consist of product quality, price, service quality, and distribution variables, the most dominant influence on consumer purchasing decisions PT. Japfa is a price variable. This means that price is the main component that can provide a decision in making a purchase. 4) Among the 4 independent variables studied, which consisted of service quality, price, and product quality variables, which had the least effect on the purchasing decision of PT. Japfa is a service quality variable.","muslikhun department of managemement stie mahardhika jl. wisata menanggal 42 a surabaya, indonesia muslikhun64@gmail.com",

496,Anomaly Detection On The High Throughput Network Of The  Atlas Tdaq System,"as the volume of data recorded from systems increases, there is a need to effectively analyse this data to gain insights about the system. one such analysis requirement is anomaly detection. data-driven approaches such as machine learning, are by construction, able to learn (to some degree) the underlying representations in the data and consequently identify a hyperplane which separates the normal point states from the anomalous ones. in most cases the data is not linear in the parameter space, does not possess apparent trends or periodic seasonality and is noisy. in this work, we develop models for anomaly detection analysing data obtained from the networking devices of the atlas data acquisition system (comprising approximately 10 000 interfaces polled at 30 seconds intervals). the selection of algorithms was based on robustness and interpretability of the models. ultimately, the deep learning architectures as well as those inspired by biological networks and those that employ transformations that linearise the measurement space were chosen. preliminary results indicate that we are able to model the system to some degree and the anomaly detection solution is generic for a multiple parallel suite of time series data, somewhat independent of its origin. as such these concepts and results are also applicable to the energy space, for example, monitoring data streams from a power station. successful development would imply new insights into how anomalies occur in a system and/or when they will occur and would allow for in-depth analyses such as root cause analysis. the combination of an interpretable model and root cause analysis would lay foundations for developing a reinforcement learning based system in which the system could take active decisions on certain anomaly encounters.","anomaly detection, deep learning, 2008","The aims of this paper were to present our findings on the development of anomaly detection algorithms for the ATLAS TDAQ high throughput network. The number of dimensions requiring resolution implied that an approach capable of tackling a multivariate input be chosen. In addition, the data possessed an asynchronous time variable intended to aid the solution in better understanding the behaviour of a particular node on the basis of when a device had been polled and to also allow for seasonal patterns to be drawn. The volume of data requiring processing per second implied that methods capable of handling streaming data be considered. Based on all the above factors, data- driven techniques were employed for the solution. In testing these methods only one metric was retained for simplicity (the solutions scale across metrics). We observed that neural network architectures though capable of learning underlying representations of data could not find learnable patterns in the data beyond learning the average of the dataset. Biologically inspired models yielded the best results of the developed methods due to that they were able to not only capture the seasonal trends of the data, but also predict closely what future values would be. Linearised measurement space models yielded partial results due to requiring increased orders of data points to fully define the underlying patterns. Similar to neural network-based architectures, both models assumed that the data recorded fully modelled the system’s behaviour and based on the linearised measurement space results we observe why the neural architectures were not successful at finding the approximate path for future values of the measurements. The models presented above are all class agnostic and as such can be applied to different domains once the data has been pre-processed to follow the formats required by each of the algorithms. One useful application would be in the energy sector where power plants are always expected to operate at optimal efficiency. Two avenues exist whereby there is a real-time anomaly detection system or the case whereby failure has occurred and there is a need to analyse the data from the failure. Robust anomaly detection algorithms would allow for early detection of system failures and also offer an avenue for root cause analysis in the cases when failure has already occurred. We conclude by noting that the algorithms developed in this paper are generic and thus are applicable to different domains.","mitchell phiri, simon h. connell, pathmanathan naidoo department of mechanical engineering science university of johannesburg johannesburg - 2006, south africa 201215553@student.uj.ac.za, shconnell@uj.ac.za, naidoop@uj.ac.za mikel e. pozo astigarraga atlas trigger and data acquisition european organisation for nuclear research meyrin - 1217, switzerland eukeni.pozo@cern.ch dave nicholls nesca board south african nuclear energy corporation north west province - 0240, south africa nicholdr@iburst.co.za",
497,Model For Measure Supply Risk In Supply Chains: A Sarscov-2 Crisis Case Study,this work presents a model for measuring supply risk based on the financial impact on the company caused by a supply-side disruption that will result in the non-delivery of a purchasing material. a research action methodology is used to develop the model and to illustrate its application on a real case company to manage the sars-cov-2 coronavirus supply chain disruption. the model allowed to quantify the potential impact of a disruption of individual purchasing parts and thus to correctly funnel and prioritize risk mitigation activities to overcome the possible disruptions.,"supply chain risk, supplier risk, cost of capital, infrastructure","The growing complexity and globalization of supply chains make them more vulnerable to disruptions. This leads to a substantial increase in risk and makes it mandatory for companies to have an effective supply chain risk management system. At the same time, resources for risk mitigation and crisis management are limited. Hence, on the supply-side, a system is needed to focus the available resources on the most important purchasing materials and risks. A common approach is to use the amount spend on the material as an indicator of its importance. It has been argued that this approach is flawed, and a better solution is needed. In this paper, a quantitative model for assessing supply-side risks has been developed and implemented at Sensirion Holding AG and successfully tested during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. The model allowed the company to quantify the potential impact of a disruption of individual purchasing parts and thus to correctly funnel and prioritize risk mitigation activities. Especially during crisis management, the ability to prioritize and focus is essential. Based on the same model, a process to assess the effectiveness of proposed mitigation actions and to track their progress during the implementation has been presented. A cost-benefit analysis shows its financial viability. The model has been described in a general way so that it can also be implemented and used by other companies. This research has been limited to describe supply-side risks. For a complete supply chain risk management, also company internal risks and customer-side risks need to be considered. Most notably, the calculation of the potential impact of a purchasing material disruption is based on the sales forecast. However, sales forecasts are inherently inaccurate. The model could be developed further to account for such customer-side risks present in the sales forecast and, for example, consider several sales forecast scenarios. Moreover, the model to describe risk events was intentionally kept simple and thus assumptions were made that might not hold true. A more enhanced model could be used to better describe the realistic course of a disruption. Specifically, the time-to-disruption and the impact factor are probably dependent on each other. A model could be developed to describe this dependency. Lastly, a quantitative approach to assess the probability of certain risk events is desirable because human judgment is prone to heuristics in decision making which regularly leads to misjudgments. While it’s undoubtedly necessary and beneficial to know what the major risks are and how to handle them in case needed, some risks are not foreseeable.

500,Tax Holiday Incentive Strategy During The Covid-19  Pandemic Period To Increase Investment In Indonesia,"this study aims to evaluate tax incentive strategies related to tax holiday policies to increase investment during the covid-19 pandemic in indonesia. the research approach used in this research is qualitative with data collection techniques using in-depth interviews, observation, literature study/documentation, and source triangulation. the study results found that every year there was an increase in the number of investment requests, but in fact, only a few received tax holiday facilities. even in 2017, practically no new registrants were interested in the tax holiday scheme. this study concludes that the tax holiday policy has so far been quite effective in increasing investment in indonesia, but its achievement has not been optimal. in implementing the tax holiday policy, especially during the covid-19 pandemic, there has not been any significant change in its incentive policy to attract investors to invest in indonesia because it is still facing several obstacles. one of the main obstacles in the regulation is the provision of tax holiday decisions apart from the coverage of the 18 pioneer industrial sectors, only allowing other industries to apply for tax holiday facilities as long as there is an academic study which can prove that it can be categorized as a pioneer industry. the problem faced in obtaining approval from the directorate general of taxes is the process that will take a long time if the investment is not included in the scope of the list of pioneer industries. according to the mandate of article 5 pmk. 150/2018, it must go through inter-ministerial discussions. these discussions are coordinated by bkpm and involve the ministry of finance and ministries from related sectors.","tax holiday, investment","The effectiveness of taxation policies in providing tax holiday facilities to increase foreign investment in BKPM in 2018 is quite effective but not optimal enough to attract foreign investors to invest in Indonesia. It can be indicated by a decrease in the realization of foreign investment receipts, even though in 2018, the number of foreign investors receiving tax holiday facilities has increased compared to previous years. Ironically, Indonesia, an archipelago of maritime country, does not even have a tax holiday facility at PMK. 150/PMK.010/2018 given to the shipping industry sector (shipbuilding) even though this sector is needed to support realizing the vision and commitment stated by the President of Indonesia to realize Indonesia as a world maritime axis. The World Bank recommends that Indonesia focus on attracting a lot of investment, where foreign investment (FDI) to Indonesia is still low compared to other ASEAN countries. The Government must immediately take strategic steps to overcome all investment obstacles, as stated above, regarding obstacles to investment in Indonesia. To expand investment, among the main obstacles in the regulation of tax holiday decisions apart from the coverage of 18 pioneer industrial sectors stipulated in PMK 150/PMK.010/2018, other sectors can still get tax holidays as long as they are able to prove that their sector meets the criteria to be categorized as a pioneer industry. Therefore, during the Covid-19 pandemic should be a good momentum for Indonesia to stimulate Indonesia's investment optimism. Regulations must be simplified and made in such a way as to attract investors to invest in Indonesia. Therefore, it is better to cover more pioneer industrial sector being held so that there will be an expansion in business/investment opportunities and employment. However, to ensure legal certainty, the addition of these new pioneering industrial sectors must be stipulated in the minister of finance regulation. Other obstacles in the application of tax holiday policies are inefficient bureaucracy and government regulations, the inconsistency of the Government regarding the determination of tax holiday regulations, and weak regional autonomy, including constraints in terms of providing land permits for investment locations and other factors such as political stability, labor costs which is expensive and so on. Another obstacle is that the investors themselves are not right in applying for a tax holiday with the realization of their investment. Researchers recommend that the tax authorities revise the current tax holiday scheme policy by adding other business fields in the pioneer industry, which can guarantee legal certainty, and make several efforts to overcome obstacles such as simplifying business licensing, limiting the decision to get Tax Holiday approval in BKPM level that does not need to involve DGT. The other recommendations are improving the integration of central and regional policies, expanding the socialization of Tax Holiday and Licensing Services for Integrated Business Electronically or Online Single Submission, supervision, and inspection of taxpayers who perform Tax Avoidance or Tax Avoidance must be increased so that state tax revenues can be optimized. Indonesia, an archipelagic or maritime country, does not even have a tax holiday facility for the shipbuilding industry sector. The Indonesian Government must be committed to the President of Indonesia's vision and commitment to realize Indonesia as a world maritime axis that aims to make Indonesia a large, strong, and prosperous maritime country. By restoring Indonesia's identity as a maritime country, securing maritime interests and security, empowering maritime potential to realize economic equality in Indonesia, reviewing the tax holiday policy, which is also based on maritime countries, the maritime sector (including the shipbuilding industry) will progress better. The government or related institutions should improve and review the licensing process's integration at the central and local levels. Although the tax holiday itself does not have obstacles at the central level, other constraints that have an impact on increasing investment from foreign investors must be corrected, especially licensing problems in the regions because the Government must guarantee investors to obtain business permits and land where a business is easy to run. In addition, related institutions must be more active in foreign investors' needs for the tax incentive itself, especially for tax holidays. BKPM and the Directorate General of Taxes must carry out adequate supervision and regular field inspections so that investors comply with applicable regulations. With this less optimal OSS system, it is hoped that BKPM will continue to update the system to make it easier for foreign investors to access the system. In addition, the omnibus law is needed as the only primary law regulating licensing, to integrate policy content (recodification) and rationalization of various licenses spread across 70 sector Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management Monterrey, Mexico, November 3-5, 2021","novianita rulandari, chairil anwar pohan, alian natision, mohammad sofyan, putri ayu lestari institut ilmu sosial dan manajemen stiami novianitarulandari@gmail.com","References

501,Factors Of Successful Adoption Of E-Filing During The  Covid-19 Pandemic,"the adoption of e-filing in the midst of the covid-19 pandemic occupies a crucial position for taxpayers because it makes it easier for taxpayers to fulfill their tax responsibility. this study uses the factors of information quality, system quality, service quality, and collaboration quality to predict taxpayers’ satisfaction and intentions when using e-filing. taxpayers’ satisfaction and intention will determine the success of e-filing. based on the above background, this study aims to test the success of using e-filing applications in the midst of the covid-19 pandemic in terms of e-filing quality. individual taxpayers who understand the use of e-filing in carrying out their tax obligations are selected to be respondents in this study. based on empirical data collected through questionnaires to 150 taxpayers, the results of this study indicate that the e-filing system quality and the e-filing services quality partially are factors that affect taxpayers’ satisfaction and intention, which then have an impact on e-filing success. taxpayers’ satisfaction and intention will increase along with system quality and service quality. the information quality and the collaboration quality still have not succeeded in influencing the taxpayers’ satisfaction and intention to use e-filing.","e-filing, system quality, service quality","Based on the results of data acquisition and processing, and data analysis, the e-filing information quality has no effect on taxpayers’ satisfaction and taxpayers’ intention in using e-filing. The taxpayers’ satisfaction and taxpayers’ intention are strongly influenced by the e-filing system quality and the e-filing service quality. The e-filing collaboration quality has no effect on taxpayers’ satisfaction and taxpayers’ intention to use e-filing. The use of e- filing by taxpayers has a positive influence on taxpayers’ intention to use e-filing. Taxpayers’ satisfaction with e-filing has a positive influence on e-filing success. Likewise, taxpayers’ intention has a positive effect on e-filing success. It is expected that the obtained results can be taken as input for DGT to improve the e-filing quality which has not been put into its maximum capacity to provide satisfaction and encouragement for taxpayers to use e-filing. The e-filing collaboration quality can actually have a positive impact in the use of e-filing, so it is expected that DGT can emphasize good relationship management with taxpayers. The collaboration between the two can create harmony so that the use of e-filing can be a pleasant experience for taxpayers. There are some limitations in this study that should be noted. First, this study was conducted only based on the perception of individual taxpayers as a sample and the relatively short timeline limited to the time of the Covid-19 pandemic only. Second, the data collection technique in this study utilizes a questionnaire survey, therefore, there is a possibility of bias on the produced data due to cognitive differences between the researchers and the respondents to the questions given. Third, the discussion in this study on each aspect of the variable is still broad and cannot be done in depth. Last, the researchers expected that the studied number of respondents would be 170, but only 150 respondents were collected. In regards to the limitations of the study mentioned above, the suggestion that the authors would like to propose for further research is to expand the research timeline to observe the extent to which e-filing applications Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management Monterrey, Mexico, November 3-5, 2021","agus arianto toly tax accounting program universitas kristen petra surabaya, indonesia agustoly@petra.ac.id alicia wijaya tax accounting program universitas kristen petra surabaya, indonesia alicia@petra.ac.id priscilia geovany lewa tax accounting program universitas kristen petra surabaya, indonesia priscilia@petra.ac.id sonia frensiana tjung tax accounting program universitas kristen petra surabaya, indonesia sonia@petra.ac.id","References

507,Enhancing Msme Performance Through Digital  Marketing And Innovation With Government Policy As,"indonesian msmes currently have very serious challenges and problems that are different from the previous economic crises that occurred in indonesia. msme performance has decreased during the covid-19 pandemic by 30%. however, the bungo regency msme business performance has decreased with a smaller percentage of 20% when compared to the percentage decline at the national level. there are still many msme actors who are reluctant to innovate even though innovation is very important and only 10% of msmes use digital marketing even though government policies lead to an increase in the use of technology, at least 17.2% of msmes must be technology-based. the purpose of this study is to analyze the influence of innovation and digital marketing on the performance of msmes directly and indirectly and to analyze the effect of government policy as a moderating variable. the sample in this study amounted to 85 msme actors. data were analyzed using sem pls. from the test results, it is found that innovation does not directly affect the performance of msmes, but has an indirect effect on the performance of msmes through digital marketing. meanwhile, digital marketing variables and government policies directly affect the performance of msmes. government policy variables are not able to moderate the influence of innovation and digital marketing variables on msme performance. msme actors will innovate and use digital marketing at the pressure of the environment that requires them to adapt and not because of policies from the government.","msme performance, innovation, digital marketing","H6. Moderating Z*X1→Z 0.040 0.519 Rejected H7. Moderating Z*X2→Z -0.038 0.507 Rejected Source: Researchers, processed data (2021) From the test results as shown in Table 6 above for the effect of the moderating variable, a smaller value is obtained than t table so that the conclusion is H6 and H7 are rejected. This means that government policies are not able to moderate the influence of innovation and digital marketing on the performance of MSMEs. Discussion Testing the effect of the innovation variable on the performance of MSMEs in this study obtained insignificant results. This is because during the COVID-19 pandemic, MSME actors think that by innovating, they will increase spending because innovation requires additional costs. In addition, MSME actors are afraid of failure and do not dare to take risks to do something new. During a pandemic, surviving with old products is better than exploring, but it doesn't necessarily work. This is in line with previous research, namely the research of (Cucculelli and Peruzzi, 2020)(Oyedele et al., 2020) who said that innovation had no effect on business performance. The results of the research on the influence of digital marketing on the performance of MSMEs obtained positive and significant results. The use of digital marketing has a positive impact on the performance of MSMEs. The existence of government policies that require social distancing and prohibition of gatherings, urges MSME actors to make changes in marketing so that they can still reach their consumers. Digital marketing has brought new insights and new markets for MSMEs to reach consumers wider than ever before. Some of the benefits that are felt directly from the use of digital marketing are the savings in promotional costs. With content sharing and electronic word of mouth that consumers do without being asked, it has strengthened the performance of MSMEs. This is in line with the research conducted by (Istianingsih, Harahap and Ali, 2020)(Melović et al., 2020)(Low et al., 2020). Although innovation does not directly affect the performance of MSMEs, placing digital marketing as a mediating variable can change the influence of innovation on MSME performance through digital marketing. This is also in line with research conducted by (Kristinae et al., 2020) that innovation does not directly affect business performance but has an indirect effect after being mediated by digital marketing. Tests on the moderating effect of government policies, both the effect on innovation and digital marketing, do not have an effect on the performance of MSMEs. This means that there are or no government policies, to innovate and use digital marketing is a form of encouragement from the environment they feel for the progress of their business (Yuhertiana and Fatun, 2020). Although the government has launched policies to encourage MSMEs to innovate, such as training on the use of production equipment, packaging improvements or activities that encourage innovation, MSME actors are still reluctant to change. Meanwhile, the urge to use digital marketing is not an effect of government policies that direct marketing strategies through the Go digital MSME program that was echoed several years ago. 4. Conclusions and Recommendations 4.1 Conclusions From the test results, it is found that innovation does not directly affect the performance of MSMEs, but has an indirect effect on the performance of MSMEs through digital marketing. Digital marketing and government policies have a direct effect on the performance of MSMEs. Government policy variables are not able to moderate the influence of innovation and digital marketing variables on MSME performance. 4.2Recommendations The government should better understand the condition of MSMEs and focus more on identifying what are the Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management Monterrey, Mexico, November 3-5, 2021","moderating effect nanik istianingsih, sarjon defit and zefriyenni lecture of management doctoral program, upi yptk padang, indonesia nanikistianingsih1324@gmail.com","References

513,Utilization Of Maggot Black Soldier Fly (Bsf) Cultivation  For Fish Feed,"the use of black soldier fly or maggot black soldier fly (bsf) as a degrading agent for organic waste has begun to be developed to reduce the volume of organic waste. bsf maggot used to degrade organic waste also has a valuable protein source for animal feed to the alternative to conventional feed. therefore, this study aims to produce a bsf maggot product that can be used as fish feed and analyze its feasibility based on sni 01-4266-2006 concerning artificial feed for carp (cyprinus carpio l.) on an intensive aquaculture scale. the results showed that bsf maggot is an alternative feed used as fish because it is rich in water, protein, fat, ash, and fiber content.",fish feed,"The conclusion drawn from the study is that the results of laboratory tests on the use of BSF larvae as fish feed showed that the water content, protein, fat, and ash content values were following the quality standard values used. The crude fiber content is relatively high so that the value of the natural fiber content exceeds the quality standard. According to researchers, BSF maggot is an alternative feed used for fish because it is rich in water, protein, fat, ash, and fiber content. V.

521,Cooperative And Msme Empowerment Strategies In  Economic Recovery During The Covid-19 Pandemic In,"the development of organizations in indonesia is increasingly rapid and competitive. one of the growing organizations in indonesia is a cooperative. cooperative is a form of business that is characterized by togetherness or based on kinship. in indonesia, cooperatives are engaged in various fields to achieve community welfare. at first, cooperatives were a collection of people who had a lower level of the economy, where through cooperatives they both wanted or had a goal to improve their welfare. nationally, the number of registered cooperatives is more than adequate to support the people's economic movement. this means that if the existing number has a paradigm, ideology, and a real cooperative spirit, it will become a very large force and provide guarantees for economic sustainability that is based on the spirit of self-help and cooperation. this condition actually became the ideals of the founding fathers of the nation when they had to choose the economic model to be built when the world was divided into 2 (two) models, namely capitalism and socialism. cooperatives have similarities with the original social system of the indonesian nation, namely collectivism. the indonesian gotong royong community likes to help each other.","cooperatives, people's economy, business entities, family","Cooperatives and MSMEs, especially micro, must build the synergy of the two institutions to be necessary. Because the potential for micro-enterprises, especially those associated with cooperatives, is quite large. First, the dominance of economic activity in Indonesia in terms of a large number of MSMEs. Second, micro MSMEs have the fighting power to survive in a difficult economic era. This is verified by history. Third, MSMEs when they join cooperatives have strong bargaining power with third parties. Because cooperatives with legal entities will easily access capital, provide guidance to their members and have the opportunity to prosper together. Fourth, there are requirements for synergy, namely improvements to cooperatives so that regulations are strong enough, professional management, access to capital opportunities, and assistance from both central and regional governments.
