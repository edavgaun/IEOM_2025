0,Aircraft Engine Remaining Useful Life Prediction  Framework For Industry 4.0,"this article proposes a condition-based maintenance (cbm) approach for aircraft engines and remaining useful life (rul) monitoring, and failure prevention. due to the unavailability of run-to-failure data, turbofan engine simulation data, obtained from nasa repository, is used to train and test our model. data acquisition and management system framework and planning are proposed for online monitoring and rul prediction. in practice, sensor measurements usually suffer from noise contamination, hence the prediction models are challenged by noise contaminated data for both training and testing tasks. this is done to assess their prediction ability in a similar condition of having noisy data. linear and nonlinear prediction models are developed, with performance comparison addressing both regression and classification problems. models performance indices consider both prediction accuracy and percentage of predictions before the actual failure (pbaf). the proposed model considers continuous learning and improvement to account for any further operational changes that affect the model prediction ability. this is reached by ingesting the model with the actual rul during the maintenance of the engine unit, and by comparing it to the predicted one.","failure prediction, engine degradation, iot","and Future work This research proposed a framework for aircraft engine's RUL prediction. This framework included On-line remote monitoring and continuous learning with cloud connection facility. The RUL prediction model parameters are meant to be updated every maintenance operation, which helps improving the accuracy and the predicting capabilities of the model. The sensor noise problem was overcome by our model which affirms its robustness. This promotes its ability to provide reliable predictions with real data that is normally contaminated with noise. The input data were preprocessed before exploring the prediction possibility. The preprocessing included outliers and highly correlated variables removal for reaching better modelling performance. We studied both regression and classification methodologies for performing RUL prediction. The Random Forest classifier showed promising results. It offers safe and conservative condition-based maintenance. It could provide RUL classes prediction, above/below a certain level. This was demonstrated at 20% level of RUL. The classes prediction was achieved at only 1.24% PAAF% and 7.43% general error rate. For the future work, the framework will be validated with real system and embedded sensors. Moreover, spare part stocks, arriving time and downtime to be taken into consideration for a complete maintenance planning system. 5.","hussein a. taha department of mathematics and industrial engineering polytechnique montréal montréal, h3t 1j4, canada hussein.taha@polymtl.ca ahmed h. sakr department of mathematics and industrial engineering polytechnique montréal montréal, h3t 1j4, canada ahmed-1.sakr@polymtl.ca soumaya yacout department of mathematics and industrial engineering polytechnique montréal montréal, h3t 1j4, canada soumaya.yacout@polymtl.ca",
1,Lean Manufacturing Maturity Model For An Automotive  Cluster: A Case Study In Mexico.,"a challenge of automotive enterprises is to achieve a total implementation of lean thinking tools through the manufacturing processes. the automotive cluster of nuevo león (claut) in mexico developed an instrument which evaluates the use of 23 tools distributed in five levels and 279 criterions to measure the maturity level of its member companies in the implementation of lean manufacturing tools. the instrument was made with the collaboration of three companies. this study has the objective to prove, redesign, and standardize this instrument by conducting three rounds of audits with external auditors to a case study in seven companies (oem, tier1, and tier2). the main goal is to decrease the time of evaluation and to standardize it for it to be replicable in different companies of the same industry. the methodology selected was the pdca cycle, and it was replicated twice. the redesign of the instrument was supported on a theoretical basis, using state of the art as bpm maturity model and lean enterprise self-assessment tool (lesat). the results of the audits allow to identify the practical implication of the assessment, and after two cycles led to the improvement of both the application method and the content of the instrument.","maturity model, audit",,"hector david colín-lozano, sonia guerra-loji and martha arely vargas-alvarado b.sc in engineering management university of monterrey nuevo león, méxico hector.colin@udem.edu, sonia.guerral@udem.edu, martha.vargas@udem.edu luz maría valdez-de la rosa, jesús vázquez-hernández engineering management program university of monterrey nuevo león, méxico luz.valdez@udem.edu , jesus.vazquez@udem.edu","References

2,Cluster Factors For Productivity Improvement: A Case  Study For A Home Appliance Cluster In Mexico.,"since the early nineteen hundred several associations have risen. these are cluster associations of concentrated firms belonging to the same industrial sector receiving support from academic institutions and the local government in order to enhance competitiveness. literature seems to be vast on studying the effect of clusters on the competitiveness of members (see karaev, koh, and thomas-szamosi 2007; awad and amro 2017; carrie 1999). however, there is vague formal analysis of the effects that clusters have on members' productivity. therefore, this study aims to analyze whether geographic proximity, social capital and innovation within a cluster affect cluster members' productivity, particularly in a local mexican home appliance industry cluster (clelac). the data for analysis was retrieved using a self-designed survey, applied to current executives from the companies which are members of the cluster. this data was analyzed using the partial least squares algorithm, introducing the construct of productivity as the dependent variable, and the constructs of geographic proximity, social capital, and innovation as the independent variables. the results suggest that geographic proximity and social capital within a cluster affect positively firm’s productivity growth, which proves the first two hypotheses of this study. apart from the hypotheses, two new causal relations were found in the model: proximity and its positive impact on the cluster’s social capital; and social capital’s impact on innovation within the cluster. however, the impact that innovation within the cluster may have on firm’s productivity could not be proven.","productivity, social capital, innovation, cluster. 391",,"karol villarreal, karla guerra, ruben molina b.sc in engineering management universidad de monterrey nuevo leon, mexico karol.villarrealz@udem.edu, karla.guerrad@udem.edu, ruben.molina@udem.edu luz maria valdez de la rosa engineering management department universidad de monterrey nuevo leon, mexico luz.valdez@udem.edu",
3,Improvement Of The Rnp In The Application Of The Fmea In  Automotive Processes,"we determine the prioritization of processes and tasks in automotive companies. the methodology of failure mode analysis and effects was applied, the purpose of the fmea is to take actions to eliminate or reduce failures, starting with the highest-priority ones in order to efficiently identify all possible failures in a design, a manufacturing or assembly process, or a product or service. the traditional failure mode analysis and effects methodology was applied to four different processes in the companies of the automotive industry, finding deficiencies in the calculation of the risk priority number. therefore, the calculation of the risk priority number is modified in the methodology, implementing additional steps, adding a weight to the calculation of the risk priority number. the weighting was determined in the cost function associated with a failure scenario within the process. to do this, the cost of the severity of a defect was calculated, such as the effects on the customer, warranty costs, scrap, etc. secondly, the cost of the occurrence was determined, which indicates what the company is going through when the defect is repaired. the cost of detecting a failure in the system is applied. finally, these factors are balanced. finally, a comparison is made against the traditional methodology to identify the improvement in the prioritization of tasks of failure modes that represent a greater impact on the economy of the company and have a consistent control plan.","fmea, rpn",,"leonardo gabriel hernández-landa, azucena m. garcía-león, rosa e. mata-martinez industrial engineering and management area, facultad de ciencias químicas universidad autónoma de nuevo león san nicolás de los garza, nl. 66451, méxico leogabrielhdz@gmail.com, azucenamgl@yahoo.fr, rosy275705@hotmail.com",
4,"The Importance Of Quality Management System And  Leadership In The South African Restaurant, Fast Food And","south africa, being a developing country, experiences the impact of global competition which has pushed many organizations to develop plans to respond to a continuous competitive global market. the restaurant, fast food, and catering sector is broad within the service industry involving independent restaurants, quick service restaurants and fast food outlets, outsourced catering companies, just to name a few. this study’s objective is to establish the importance of focusing on the fundamentals of quality management practices and the usefulness of leadership practices in the management process of the above-mentioned sector. this study included a quantitative research method under which an empirical investigation was executed following the literature review. the study consisted of the analysis of data collected from questionnaires administered to 65 restaurants in gauteng, south africa. after results analysis and interpretation, it is concluded that the functions of management were not well integrated, mainly the leadership functions. hence, a need to improve specific aspects of the foundations of management approaches in the restaurant, fast food and catering sector is required.","leadership, restaurant",,"catering sector – case of the gauteng region s.c. mukwakungu, a.k. lumbwe, d. niati and c. mbohwa department of quality and operations management university of johannesburg johannesburg, south africa sambilm@uj.ac.za","References

5,Factors That Contribute Towards Cost Overruns In An African  Mega-Project,"mega-projects improve the livelihoods of people and boost the country’s economy. when mega-projects are to be constructed, the government notifies the public of the details including the budgeted cost. most of these projects spiral out of control when it comes to budget and time. state-owned entity (soe) mega-projects are funded by taxpayers’ money and as a result of cost overruns, the extra funds required to cover the extra expenses are resourced from other departments’ budgets or borrowed from other countries. developing countries are hit the hardest when it comes to cost overruns in projects. the literature review results show that there are many explanations for cost overruns however these explanations can be summarised into four categories i.e. political, technical, economical and psychological. a case study methodology of one african mega-project is investigated to determine the contributing factors towards cost overruns. data is collected through interviews and company documents. the findings of the case study reveal that variation orders and contractual claims during the execution phase of an african mega-project contribute as factors towards cost overruns. innovative project management measures need to put in place in order to eradicate cost overruns.",cost overruns,"It has been identified from past studies that cost overruns is a persistent problem. Mega-projects seem to be more complex because of the project size, public stakeholders and technology involved. These large projects tend to have a higher risk and therefore increase the chances of failure. Innovative measures need to be put in place that will address cost overruns i.e. improve cost estimation techniques. Project management practices need to be implemented that will manage the projects by tracking and reporting on project progress.

6,A Variable Neighbourhood Search Algorithm For Scheduling  Of The Multi-Objective Flexible Manufacturing Systems,"flexible manufacturing systems (fms) have transfigured into a complex system because of its need to accommodate fluctuation in demands and fulfilling customers’ requirements with immediate effects. fms scheduling problem is strongly non-deterministic polynomial-time (np)-hard problem and is usually difficult to find its optimal solution. the performance of a scheduling system, in practice, is not evaluated to satisfy a single objective, but to obtain a trade-off schedule regarding multiple objectives. therefore, in this research, we make use of one of the multiple objective decision-making methods, a global criterion approach, to develop a multi-objective model for solving fms scheduling problems with consideration of three performance measures, namely minimizing mean job tardiness and mean job earliness and also mean machine idle time, simultaneously due to the complexity of the multi-objective model, a variable neighbourhood search (vns) approach is developed for solving the addressed fms scheduling problem. moreover, taguchi method is utilized to tune the parameters of the algorithm and analyze the parameters of the studying problem. the feasibility and adaptability of the proposed heuristic is investigated through a test problem in small and large sizes. finally, the results clearly indicate the superior performance of the proposed vns approach for the problem.",scheduling,,"seyed sina miri nargesi department of industrial engineering, faculty of engineering, science and research branch, islamic azad university, tehran, iran mirinargesy@gmail.com hamidreza mozaffari gilani department of civil engineering, semnan branch, islamic azad university, semnan, iran hamidreza20m@gmail.com seyyed hassan baghaipour department of marketing, manchester business school, manchester, uk seyyedhassanbaghaipour2020@yahoo.com elham amiri department of management, central tehran branch, islamic azad university, tehran, iran elhamamiri948@yahoo.com hamed olfati department of electrical and computer engineering, university of tehran, tehran, iran hamedolfati882@yahoo.com",

8,Experimental Analysis Of Program Motion Instruction Of  Industrial Robotics,"in this applied research, an experimental study has been conducted to develop a statistical-mathematical based correlation for assessing consistency and processing time of a robotized manufacturing cell simulating of an automated manufacturing system process such as the robotic leaser cutting using an educational robotics test-cell. the correlation is to investigate contributions of programming parameters on the performance of robotized work-cell. processing time has been used to model the manufacturing cycle time and consistency of the operation outs has been used to model the quality in terms cutline consistency. a set of statistical relationships have been used to simulate consistency and cycle time in order to tackle the variability of proposed sources as pieces of time and dimensions that need to be processed in the loaded parts the work-cell; in addition the relationship that suggestively correlates the impacts. a set of experimental tests has been conducted responding to the predicted formulas for the cycle time and consistency. experimentation factors that have been leveled from minimal to maximal values are selected based on the robot’s computer operating system in terms of processing speed, motion properties, and termination types the default characters of the programming. analysis the results shows that the correlation can be used to tradeoff the programming solutions objectively depending on the task design requirements. the contribution of this research work is to introduce a new depiction of optimizable factors of robotic computer programs that directly affect the performance criteria.","industrial robots, manufacturing, factors, responses","As a future work, an approach to optimize the efficiency of the robot regarding final throughput and energy consumption is highly recommended. In automated industrial production, the efficiency of robotic motions directly affects both the final throughput and the energy consumption. Simulating and analyzing the robot trajectories depending on the cycle of processing time and energy consumption can be reduced. • According to the DOE analysis, the termination is more significant and has more correlation than the speed, the optimal parameters are termination 100: Speed 2000 to get the major consistency get the smallest cycle time. • The consistency and the cycle processing time are highly dependent of the variation of motion components. • To build an effective program for the accuracy, manufacturing details are to be prepared relative the consistency movement of the tool. Error issues that impact data is a combination of human and robotic error. Human in terms of hand measuring with no constitutes as a deviation, yet still developed a trend supporting the claim as such. Robot error because of the grip strength of the FANUC robot used. The gripper is not as tight as trying to hold object steady. This causes the tool to be pushed back or forward where the trajectory when process is not consistent and far away from the original path. 5.",,

10,Advancing Digital Transformation: Integrated Digital  Transformation Framework For A Successful Deployment,"in today’s knowledge-based digital economy, the pace of innovation is accelerating with disruptive technologies being discovered and introduced rapidly. the new global business environment has pressured many organizations to be more aggressive in adopting innovation and emerging technologies and use them as the cornerstone of their competitive strategy. moreover, changing customer behavior, demand and requirement have led to complex changes and created an urgency to digitally transform an organization. in such an environment, rapid transformation is needed to accelerate and innovate business activities, business processes, models, and, ultimately, the workforce competencies. in such a situation, many c-suite executives are facing various challenges such as rigid processes, risk avoidance, digital disruption, interdepartmental conflict, disinterest in new ideas and complacency to move forward. these challenges require a vastly different approach to digitally transform a company’s business. the objective of this paper is to propose an integrated digital transformation framework by integrating the business-need space (model elements), problem space (design thinking), solution space (waterfall, agile) and change management space methods for a successful digital transformation deployment.","design thinking, change management, agile","In this paper, we presented an enhanced integrated digital transformation framework by mapping well-known methodologies such as Design Thinking, Agile SDLC, Waterfall SDLC and Change Management to four identified spaces (business need, problem, solution, operational). The framework will guide managers to implement sustainable digital transformation practices / principles for achieving an effective and efficient operation. Managers need to consider the strategic fit and the portfolio fit of the digital transformation in the business need space and to avoid jumping into a solution space too quickly. Moving into a solution space should be considered only after there is a sufficient validation about the problem. The main contribution of this paper is to propose an integrated framework and the analysis of the issues and challenges posed by traditional approaches. This paper contributes the body of knowledge on digital transformation research.","munir majdalawieh information systems and technology management department zayed university dubai, uae munir.majdalawieh@zu.ac.ae",

14,Two-Stage Meta-Heuristic Algorithm For Parallel Machine  Scheduling With Additional Resource Input In Shipyard,"development of an efficient workspace scheduling algorithm for shipyard manufacturing has become more crucial as the modern smart factory technologies burgeon. because shipyard manufacturing is generally conducted on a large scale, making workspace scheduling decisions is not a trivial mission. in particular, one needs to consider several factors (due date, resource limitation in the workspace, etc.) in order to efficiently schedule block processing in the workspace. a commonly used strategy is to input additional resources into a workspace to shorten the total production time. by implementing this strategy, one can curtail the total production time, which can later result in significant cost reductions in shipyard manufacturing. in this study, we tackle the workspace scheduling in shipyard manufacturing problem by taking the additional resource input strategy into account. this problem can be considered as a class of the parallel machine scheduling problem. we present a mixed integer programming model for the addressed problem and develop an efficient meta-heuristic algorithm. the proposed algorithm is composed of two stages: (i) a genetic algorithm enhanced by an ordering-based heuristic scheduling and (ii) a tabu-search algorithm for local search that considers the additional resources input method.","genetic algorithm, tabu search",,"manufacturing soonkyo lee, taesu cheong school of industrial management engineering korea university seoul, south korea myeva@korea.ac.kr tcheong@korea.ac.kr seokhyun chung industrial & operations engineering university of michigan ann arbor, mi, usa seokhc@umich.edu",
15,Iot Sensors In Aquaculture – Barriers And Facilitators For  Sustainability In Brazilian Context,"the unep has identified artisanal fisheries (af) as the most important sector for meeting the twin needs of economic development and environmental sustainability. during 2004-14, fish exports from brazil declined from 107,000 tons to 34,000 tons while fish imports grew from 158,000 tons to 403,000 tons due to low productivity of brazilian afs. hence it is important to understand opportunities for productivity improvement of these fisheries. with productivity improvement and further expansion, sustainability issues should be considered carefully. in a project funded by the newton fund in the uk and fapesc in brazil, we explored drivers of sustainable development of afs in santa catarina via a stakeholder workshop and field visits. we also interacted with officials at the epagri, the research and agricultural extension organization of the state of santa catarina. findings of the workshop and field visits are briefly summarized below but will be elaborated during the presentation at the conference. • the level of technology use in aquafarms in brazil is basic. there were one or two instances of old mechanical technology but there is no integration with the latest electronic, iot technologies. • there is general lack of awareness of sustainability issues among most afs. since water supply is abundant, they tend to think pollution is not an issue. without adequate efforts in treating the waste water before they leave aquafarms, pollution issues could be the most significant limiting factor for future expansion of afs. • there is a lack of awareness of the fish supply chains as most afs do not directly deal with supermarkets or final consumers. • lack of financing and access to banks is also a serious bottleneck for future expansion. • the afs tend to work with traditional models of fishing. more training on new business models (e.g., (i) linking directly to market, (ii) using cooperative structures to ensure large supplying power and consequently winning bargaining power, and (iii) developing future contracts for supply of fish to the market to ensure all fish produced are sold on time) will help the entire af industry. • new internet of things (iot) technologies should be developed with local culture in mind. it can be automatic resulting in fewer labour requirements but should be supplemented with proper 465",,,"ramakrishnan ramanathan, yanqing duan, tahmina ajmal, feng dong and samuel van ransbeeck university of bedfordshire luton lu1 3ju united kingdom ram.ramanathan@beds.ac.uk, samuel.vanransbeeck@beds.ac.uk joaquim manoel monteiro valverde and silma battezzati valverde instituto federal de educação, ciência e tecnologia catarinense rua das missões, 100, blumenau santa catarina, 89051-000, brazil joaquim.valverde@ifc.edu.br",
16,Application Of Lean Management Systems In Pathology  Laboratory Work Process And Laboratory Environment,"the purpose of this paper is to design a future value stream map of the system and pathology laboratory process with lean health care application tools in terms of quality improvement in order to decrease the non-value-added activities for pathology unit in a public hospital based in istanbul, turkey. this paper aims to decrease waiting time, sample rejection, mistake, manual processes, and disorders as well as increase the suitability of laboratory environment and work safety. data are collected from personal observations, information technologies unit, and authorized employees. in order to measure sub-processes, some qualitative data are transformed into quantitative data via authorized employees’ experiences. moreover, data tracking and keeping systems are too poor for revealing the current situation. the current value stream map of the system of the radiology department of a public education and research hospital was analyzed and the future value stream map of the system and pathology pathway was redesigned with lean health care application tools in terms of quality improvement. the greatest limitation is the resistant to change and fear of talking on mistakes and low performances. this paper states an example of a current and future value stream map showing systematically where the bottlenecks are and how these can be improved and what specific benefits will this analysis bring to the health care system. it will be useful for both academicians and practitioners on how to apply lean to health care. 468",,", getting result decrease average from 7 days to 5 days by applying the lean methods. Even though there are still manual processes in macroscopy such as embedding and microtome devices using the new technology would automatize the process in future. Lean techniques are possible to implement at other pathology laboratories in different hospitals which will also have promising results. Many hospitals have similar manual activities such as manual signature, achieving system. Most of pathology laboratory have similar process, so methods used in this project can be practicable in other pathology labs. All in all, an improved flowchart is created which eliminates non-value-added processes of the current flowchart. In consideration of all these outcomes, it is highly suggested that the hospital should apply these improved suggestions which are also explained and aligned with lean application methods.","hatice camgoz akdag management engineering department istanbul technical university istanbul, 34367, turkey camgozakdag@itu.edu.tr hür bersam bolat management engineering department istanbul technical university istanbul, 34367, turkey bolat@itu.edu.tr ahmet haşim arslan management engineering department istanbul technical university istanbul, 34367, turkey hasimars@gmail.com ecem karacakaya management engineering department istanbul technical university istanbul, 34367, turkey ecemkaracakaya@gmail.com",

19,New Class Of Simple And Efficient Clustering Algorithms For  Multiscale Mathematical Programming With Demand Data,"integration across a supply chain decision levels is key on improving investment returns. integration of different time scales leads to large scale problems usually computationally intractable. different approaches have been proposed to tackle the problem in terms of modeling and solution methods. however, most of them are problem specific or applicable only to short time horizons. clustering has the potential to handle such problems by grouping similar input parameters together and considerably reducing the model size while not compromising solution accuracy. this work presents a new class of clustering algorithms to support the integration of planning applications of different time scales. the clustering algorithms were formulated using integer programming with integral absolute error as similarity measure. two different clustering algorithms were developed: normal and sequence. the models were developed in the gams software. two case studies are presented to assess the algorithms outputs and computational performance using utility demand data. it was found that the algorithm is capable of finding good quality solutions; and even succeed at finding optimal solutions with a small computational effort while providing clusters with high intra-cluster similarity and low inter-cluster similarity.","multiscale, clustering, algorithm, tactical","This study targets the integrated supply chain problem employing a clustering methodology. Since the use of shorter time periods lead to large and intractable models, this study main objective is to decrease the model size by denoting the days of the year by typical days during the operating year while maintaining accuracy in the results. Accordingly, a mathematical programming methodology was used to model the clustering problem with single or multiple attributes. There are clustering advantages in terms of solution time compared with the full scale model, while increasing size had a minor effect on solution accuracy. It was found that normal clustering yields better objective function, average, and standard deviation error values compared with sequence. For the one attribute case study, the error range is within ± 0.5 % for all studied cases. The error grows as the number of cluster increases suggesting there is an optimal number of normal or sequence clusters regardless of cluster quality.

20,Allocation Of Hydrogen Produced Via Power-To-Gas  Technology To Various Power-To-Gas Pathways,"the global energy sector is growing fast which requires a quicker shift to renewable energy to maintain the rise in the global temperature. unlike conventional power plants, electricity from renewable sources cannot be adjusted easily to match consumer power demand because renewable resources are intermittent short-term seasonal power sources. accordingly, a rapid increase in surplus power is expected in the future. instead of losing the surplus power or exporting it for low returns, storage and utilization in other sectors urgently need to be explored. power-to-gas technology offers a possible solution for optimal use of energy surplus and helps managing the intermittent and weather-dependent renewable energies like wind, solar, or hydro in a storable chemical energy form. the main concept behind power-to-gas technology is to make use of surplus electricity to decompose water molecules into their primary components: hydrogen and oxygen. power-to-gas is not only a storage technology; its role can be extended to other energy streams including transportation, industrial use, injection into the natural gas grid as pure hydrogen, and renewable natural gas. the goal of the current study is to investigate the feasibility of four specific power-to-gas pathways in ontario, canada. the pathways examined are power-to-gas to mobility fuel, power-to-gas to industry, power-to-gas to natural gas pipeline for use as hydrogen-enriched natural gas, and power-to-gas to renewable natural gas (i.e., methanation). the study quantifies the hydrogen volumes at three production capacity factors 67% (16 h/day), 80% (19 h/day), and 96% (23 h/day)upon utilizing ontario’s surplus electricity baseload. five allocation scenarios (a-e) of the hydrogen produced to the four power- to-gas pathways are investigated and their economic and environmental aspects considered. allocation scenario a in which hydrogen assigned to each pathway is constrained by a specific demand is based on ontario’s energy plans for pollution management in line with international efforts to reduce global warming impacts. scenarios b-e are about utilization of the produced hydrogen entirely for one of mobility fuel, industrial feedstock, injection into the natural gas grid, or renewable natural gas synthesis, respectively. the study also examines the economic feasibility and carbon offset of the ptg pathways in each scenario. the amount of surplus baseload electricity for 2017 of each capacity factor is converted to hydrogen via water electrolysis. accordingly, the total hydrogen produced is approximately 170 kilo-tonnes (kt), 193 kt, and 227 kt, respectively. results indicate that the power-to-gas to mobility fuel pathway in scenarios a and b has the potential to be implemented. utilization of hydrogen produced via 506",,,"suaad s. al-zakwani1, azadeh maroufmashat1, michael fowler1, ali elkamel1,2 1department of chemical engineering, university of waterloo, 200 university avenue west, waterloo, ontario n2l 3g1, canada department of chemical engineering, khalifa university, abu dhabi, uae salzakwani@uwaterloo.ca, azadeh.mashat@gmail.com, mfowler@uwaterloo.ca, aelkamel@uwaterloo.ca, ali.elkamel@ku.ac.ae",
21,A Data Envelopment Analysis Approach To Determine  Project Activities Weight Factor,"planning is one the most fundamental steps of project management. every project consists of a set of activities. with the increase in number of activities or complexity of projects, project activities efficient management is important in the defined range of resources. due to the limited organizational resources, activities planning is an issue for managers & researchers to be concerned about. a project should be accomplished in the specified range of time & budget. therefore planning the project with realistic attitude is a necessity. knowing the priority & the importance of the activities leads to efficient activities management & correct and accurate allocation of time, budget, cost and other resources. thus, different elements such as cost, time, project staffs' skill & other elements can affect each activities weight factor. determination of activity weight factor depends on the various aspects. to this end, current study has proposed an approach to determine activities weight factor applying data envelopment analysis. the proposed approach includes three phases. in the first phase project activities have been extracted based on the work breakdown structure. then, the second phase does recognize effective parameters on activities importance. in this phase, research's literature has been reviewed & these parameters have been extracted. afterward, based on the academic and industry's expert's idea in the field of project management effective parameters on project activities importance have been selected. in order to assign weights to the activities in the third phase, initially the proper dea model has been chosen. model's inputs & outputs have been determined & activities weights have been specified on the basis of gained efficiency numbers. eventually, the proposed model has been solved & demonstrated in a numerical example.","project management, project activities",,"hadi shirouyehzad* & negin berjis department of industrial engineering najafabad branch islamic azad university najafabad, iran hadi.shirouyehzad@gmail.com* (corresponding author), negin.berjis@gmail.com javid jouzdani department of industrial engineering golpayegan university of technolog ,golpayegan, iran jouzdani@gut.ac.ir",
22,System Dynamics As A Solution In Increasing Regional Cash  Of Daerah Istimewa Yogyakarta By Considering,"the region of yogyakarta (diy) is one of the regions in indonesia. community growth in yogyakarta reaches 1.34% in 2017 which can cause various problems such as unemployment community that continues to grow every year. in addition, another serious problem in yogyakarta is high congestion which is implicated by the increasing number of population in diy. those problems have a bad influence on regional cash which is very useful in the development of the area. this study aims to increase regional cash of diy by considering available employment and traffic congestion. because the problem is so complex, a system dynamics approach is used to solve it. based on the simulation results using powersim 2005, the main cause of unstable regional cash is the high cost of building new roads, the cause of high cost of building new roads is congestion, and the cause of congestion is the high demand for vehicles by residents of the yogyakarta area. therefore, it is necessary to reduce the level of demand for vehicles to increase the cash of the diy area. by reducing the demand for vehicles to 0.00003, which initially 0.00005 has succeeded in making the regional cash stable and increasing continuously. in addition, to increase employment in order to eliminate the population unemployment in yogyakarta, it can be done by increasing the growth rate of new companies. by increasing the growth rate of the new company to 1.2 which initially 1 has succeeded in making employment increased continuously.","regional cash, simulation, system dynamics","Based on the discussion above, it can be concluded that the Yogyakarta regional cash is experiencing fluctuations that are quite large due to the imbalance of income and expenditure of regional cash, even the longer the regional cash decreases until it can show the number 0 means that the regional cash will run out for a long time if no repairs. The main cause of unstable regional cash is the high cost of building new roads, the cause of the problem of the construction of new roads is congestion, and the cause of congestion is the high demand for vehicles by residents of the Yogyakarta area. Therefore, it is necessary to reduce the level of demand for vehicles to increase the cash of the Yogyakarta area. By reducing the demand for vehicles to 0.00003, which initially 0.00005 has succeeded in making the regional cash more stable and increasing continuously, so has the construction of new roads which were initially 11,500 meters2 repaired to 6,000 meters2. This can be realized by the government, for example by promoting programs to familiarize people traveling on foot, so that the health of the body will become better, so that the community is interested in reducing the need for vehicles. Whereas to increase employment in order to eliminate the population unemployment in Yogyakarta, it can be done by increasing the growth rate of new companies, researchers increased the growth rate of the new company to 1.2 which initially 1 and succeeded in making employment increased continuously. This can be realized by the government, for example by helping to lend initial capital if needed, facilitated in the steps of entrepreneurial affairs, providing training to the community on how to entrepreneurship well, being also informed about the benefits to be gained by entrepreneurship so that people are interested in opening a business.","employment availability and traffic congestion zakka ugih rizqi department of industrial engineering islamic university of indonesia yogyakarta, indonesia ugihzakka@gmail.com",
23,Fuzzy Ahp-Based Study Of Barriers To The Implementation  Of Cleaner Production In Textile Industry,"cleaner production (cp) approaches and technologies are top-tier tools to align with sustainable innovation policies and furthermore, governments of the developing countries have become mindful about sustainable strategies to prevent pollution in recent years. however, only a handful of organizations in textile industry in developing countries have embraced cp approaches throughout the years. therefore, this paper has shortlisted 20 barriers among all using previous literature, expert opinion and assessment of the entire stakeholders chain from the perspective of textile industries operating in developing countries which fall under 4 major criteria: i) technologic and information barrier, ii) economic and financial barrier, iii) market barrier, iv) managerial barrier. fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (fahp) which is an excellent tool to deal with linguistic level of comparisons, has been used to rank these barriers to set spotlight on the most critical group of barriers. the outcome of this paper will act as spur to set sustainable strategies and goal against them while having limited resource. finally, this paper stands out as it focuses on the proactive step to ease the application of cp approaches on textile industry which accompany high environmental expense in terms of dumping the untreated waste water into water bodies.",cleaner production,"This research outcome can help the organization to set focus on pivotal area to align strategies with the sustainable goals and strategies. In most of the developing country, organizations deal with scant resource, goes along with the conventional process and hardly thinks about bringing any changes. While applying cleaner production in such organization, a manifold barriers can come across to impede even the initiation. However, it is not possible to allocate same amount of resource and attention to each one of them. So, the outcome of this research can help the decision makers narrow down the list. Fuzzy AHP method has helped to identify the most critical to least critical factor among the selected 20 and also allowed both local and global improvement according to necessity. Also, practitioners and experts are more comfortable to give their opinion in linguistic approach rather than sharp numbers and to deal with this uncertain and ambiguous data, fuzzy approach has been adopted. Since this paper focused on the implementation of CP in textile industries of Bangladesh, government legislation has not been taken into consideration as the government has taken steps to encourage the organizations including SME to adopt greener approach and tightened up the environmental regulations. But the organizations which are adopting CP because of the government legislation have myopic view of possible obstruction that are impeding the whole process severely. So, this paper aims to contribute in this process through helping the managers being proactive about the potential critical barriers and allocate resource and effort to them to get the maximum output.

25,Toward A Socio-Cognitive Engineering Readiness Level (Scerl) To Estimate The Maturity Of A Multi-Agent’S,"context: technology readiness level (trl) has been widely used in the management of aeronautical automation projects. however, it does nothing to take on board non-technological aspects such as human factors, organizational factors and human-machine interaction to name a few. it has been demonstrated that many projects failures are related to a lack of consideration to human & organizational issues. on the other hand, human factors specialists and systems/software engineers often find collaborative and communicative aspects difficult between them. with the upcoming 4th industrial revolution, new collaborative system emerges where human operators interact with automated system to achieve a goal. this statement led us to develop a 7 steps matrix that measures the maturity of a human- machine system and enable both human factors engineers and system/software engineers to collaborate in the design of efficient and safe systems. furthermore, this scale can be used in conjunction with trl. methodology: literature review has been made on existing scales measuring human factors readiness level, manufacturing readiness level and system readiness level. this state of the art has made it possible to identify a gap among all these structural scales. they focus on one aspect that surrounds the system: either the technological maturity of the subsystems, the system’s integration into an operating environment or the consideration of human factors. the following matrix takes a functional perspective by using and activity-centered approach and seeks to assess the maturity of a human-machine systems (or joint cognitive systems) to achieve its goals in a dynamic environment. relevant elements of those scales were codified according to the meaning they were making for collaborative system design. the first model underwent a validity test that resulted in modifications of the three first steps (s-cerl 1, 2 & 3). in this way, the model follows an incremental path. indeed, it is confronted with a case study in the field of aircraft engine maintenance. several elements have been added, deleted and/or modified following its confrontation with the case study. thereby, further adjustments are expected. results: the matrix provides a framework for engineers to consider human and organizational issues surrounding the system. it makes it possible to assess the adequacy of the system with its environment during the design process. more precisely, it provides 1) a collective thinking on the future human-machine work situation with an activity-centered approach; 2) a communication support among stakeholders and a means of bringing together different work packages, especially human factors and design/software team; 3) it prepares the operational actors for change through the participatory methods it uses. 529",,,"collaborative system cabour garrick department of mathematics and industrial engineering école polytechnique de montréal montreal, qc h3t 1j4, canada garrick.cabour@polymtl.ca samuel bassetto department of mathematics and industrial engineering école polytechnique de montréal montreal, qc h3t 1j4, canada samuel-jean.bassetto@polymtl.ca élise ledoux department of physical activity sciences université du quebec a montreal montreal, qc h2x 1y4, canada ledoux.elise@uqam.ca",
26,Improving Modeling And Forecasting Of Fuel Selling Price  Using Support Vector Machines: Case Study,"the liberalization of the petroleum sector in morocco has a significant effect for petroleum product distributors. since the beginning of december 2015, fuel prices are freely determined. this event presents many constraints affecting the balance of the sector plus the competition between its economic players. with the halt of the competitive manufacturing’s activity, morocco's only refinery, distributors must, for their part, build up large stocks. as all fuel products are imported, we will be interested in the evolution by making forecasts of the price of fuels in the moroccan market. in order to achieve their objectives, the oil companies must rely on precise forecasts. in this context, our paper aims mainly to study the time series of fuel selling price in order to provide precise forecasts to the company respecting the permissible error margin of 3%. to this end, we worked with the svr function. the predictions made were quite satisfactory with regard to the constraint set by the company (plus or minus 3% as margin of error). the error of the svr function used is about 2,53%. the error in then minimized compared to our previous method: arima which error is about 2.855%.","time series, arima","In this paper, we studied the selling prices of the SSP through the SVR function. Our aim is to ameliorate the modeling and forecasting of fuel selling price.

28,Renewable Waste Water And Filtration System With  Phytoremediation Used In Aquaculture Of,"for many years, researchers improve the maintenance system of all aquaculture technology including the best idea for water maintenance and sustainability. the study is coming from a premise that the prevalence of certain factors such as ph and temperature affects water quality for pond and aquarium system. with this epistemology, the study posits that the idea of combining five different existing filtration technologies to create a new filtration technology system that will minimize the effort of performing manual maintenance procedure of keeping freshwater ornamental fish. the logic behind this idea is to choose the best characteristics of existing design of filtration system and eliminate characteristics that contribute to the negative side. using experimental method, the proponents considered material selection and system design in order to improve the potency of a design filtration unit which greatly affects amount of energy consumed and huge volume of water consumption. testing was performed to validate the efficiency of materials along with their characteristics. results of the study revealed that waste water can be renewed with the use of filtration media classified as mechanical, chemical and biological. the results of the study were contributory to improve the effectiveness of water treatment by introducing additional treatments in the mechanical filtration, proposing a chemical treatment in one of the stages, and boosting the biological absorbance of waste nutrients by applying phytoremediation. the study suggests that water quality is the key to a healthy livestock.",aquarium system,", AND RECOMMENDATIONS 5.1 Summary of Findings There are several factors that the researchers considered from performing the study; 1) Choosing the right filtration for a specific water condition is very important. Some materials can affect other water parameters like pH and hardness which is not suitable in some other aquatic organisms 2) Checking the market for availability of materials as well as the function of that specific materials must be considered to achieve full scale efficiency. The researches have seen the importance of having good and proper filtration materials and system. The first finding is that the nitrogen containing compounds (Nitrate, nitrite, ammonia) is decreased more than the tolerance level if the proposed materials as mentioned in chapter 4 is combined in one (1) system. This leads to lesser consumption of water because water parameters are more stable and clarity is maintained. The results prove that it is an efficient upon activating the filtration on the second week and later on improves as good bacteria continues to culture in the biological system of the filtration. The plant which serves as the phytoremediation tool grows lush and fast indicating that it completely absorbs the nitrogen containing compounds and other nutrients found in tank water. TDS value also had significant changes which contributes on the benefit of the effect. 5.2 Conclusion From the current study, researchers conclude that waste water can be renewed with the use of filtration media classified as mechanical, chemical and Biological. The selected materials such as Lava ring, Honey comb Matt, K1- media, are the best used natural-biological removal of Nitrogen compounds such as Nitrate. In the chemical filtration, Addition of carbon and Resin can improve water quality. Phytoremediation in terms of using the POTOS plant is really effective because the fast growth of plant indicates absorbance of toxic nutrients. Lastly, it is best to use different types of filtering materials in the mechanical part of the filtration since particles have different sizes and a specific mesh is design to capture base on the size present in water. Lastly, Water quality is the key to a healthy livestock. With this design it can help improve the Aquaculture society on the given problems. 5.3 Recommendation We highly recommend this study to be used in designing filtration or water maintenance system because of its efficiency of removal. We strongly suggest that there should be more students who conduct research that includes the fusion of biological science and engineering concepts. The world needs to have advanced inventions that helps improve the quality of environment since nowadays, the major concern is the detrimental effects of pollution specifically, water pollution. If ever the design will get thorough improvement, there are such points that it could be a solution to this problem. 555","freshwater ornamental fish charlotte palao, glyda aricon marquez, kenneth ibasco, lady claudette ferrer and patricia sagge industrial engineering department technological institute of the philippines 363 p. casal, quiapo metro manila, philippines misscjpalao@gmail.com, glydamarquez@gmail.com, kennethibasco93@gmail.com, claudette.ferrer@gmail.com, pdsagge08@gmail.com maria teresa b. mendoza industrial engineering department technological institute of the philippines 363 p. casal, quiapo metro manila, philippines mariateresa.mendoza@tip.edu.ph","REFERENCES

31,The Influence Of Early Stage Project Performance: Some  Project Performance And Outcome Correlate,"understanding how project-management performance in the early stage affects project outcomes is critical to project decision-making process. our study contributes by revealing how different constructs of project performance are interrelated before the construction phase of a project, and how they will impact project outcomes. drawing on theories of project and organization management, we develop a project performance- causality model. our research results suggest that the outcomes of completed projects are significantly directly related to the performance of project innovation and quality in the early stage of project delivery process (i.e., before project construction). succeeding analysis reveals that communication performance before project construction indirectly affects project performance, which has the largest effect on project outcomes. the research findings indicate that it is practical to estimate marginal project outcomes quantitatively prior to project construction.","project outcomes, survey research","In sum, this research develops a capital project performance-causality model. The test results with respect to the importance of Communication, Team, Scope, Innovation, Risk, and Quality to Project Outcomes are consistent with prior studies of the project-construction phase (e.g., Chen, 2014; Chen and Lin, 2018; Hoegl and Parboteeah, 2007; Keller, 1994; Tabassi and Bakar, 2009) and overall project life cycle (e.g., Chen, 2014; Bendoly and Swink, 2007). The performance-causality model not only offers understandings of how project-management performance variables (such as scope, communication, risk and innovation) affect one another in the project delivery process’s early stage , but also provides a method to compute MPOs before project construction. Namely, our research expands the comprehension of how project-management performance variables in the early stage of project delivery process influences project outcomes.","hong long chen department of business and management national university of tainan tainan, 700, taiwan along314@mail.nutn.edu.tw",
32,Establishment Of Magnetic Levitation For Flood Prevention  In Jakarta With Project Management Approach,"dki jakarta is one of the urban areas that has always experienced an increase in population every year. this results in an increase in the development of the plains of jakarta and the increase in groundwater use. as a result, groundwater is decreasing and the jakarta area is getting lower. this is exacerbated by rising sea levels due to global warming. in the future, it is very likely that areas near the waters will be inundated. by looking at the problem, researchers discouraged the project by building a reclamation that applied the working principle of magnet levitation as a place of refuge and increased the number of dwellings in the jakarta area. in addition, it can also increase jakarta's regional income and development can be carried out according to what the government wants. with the magnet levitation, the region will be free from flood threats and reduce groundwater use which is one of the threats to flooding for jakarta. this project is a long-term project that can benefit the population and government of jakarta. in addition to income from investors, this project can also increase the potential of jakarta. various kinds of things can be built in this area, including supporting facilities that can be supplied to the jakarta area such as logistic storage and so on. the total needed in this development is idr 695,580,112,442. this project is planned to start on september 3rd, 2018 and finish on november 5th, 2024 before adding contingency reserve.","flood prevention, jakarta, project management","Based on the discussion above, it can be seen that the construction of MagLev in Jakarta for flood prevention can take place as soon as 827 days and the longest is 842.

34,Proposal Of An Intermodal Transport Cost Structure Of The  Cocoa Productive Chain For The Logistic Corridor Between,"the concept of intermodal goods transport systems is proposed as a solution to the problems of inefficiency in long-haul routes for unimodal transport systems. currently, in colombia, freight transport is mainly concentrated in the highway mode, which has led to a historical dependence on this mode of transport, which also causes an increase in freight rates, which ends up directly affecting the economy of producers and consumers. this article presents a model for estimating a cost structure for an intermodal transport system for the logistics corridor between the origin (yacopí - cundinamarca) and destination (puerto de santa marta - magdalena) nodes, integrating each of the 3 ways of transportation modes – road, fluvial and ferrous – as input variables, with the aim of being applied to a supply chain of the agri-food sector; specifically in the productive chain for exporting cocoa harvested in the municipality of yacopí. the methodological model for the elaboration of the cost structure does not take into account the external costs associated with the activity of freight transport, such as: air pollution, road accidents, traffic congestion, etc. the model is based on the determination of the agri-food chain and the definition of the logistic corridor in order to be characterized through the application of the hierarchical analysis process (ahp). subsequently, the model is fed with the data collected in this specific field and by consulting the databases of public and private entities that regulate and record the way variables of the model fluctuate, such as: fuel, tolls, cost of tires and auto parts, drivers' salary, maintenance costs, etc. once the information has been consolidated, the costs associated with the intermodal transport of cargo by distance 603",,,"yacopí and the port of santa marta jefferson rubiano forero industrial engineering program faculty of engineering investigative group (gipia) universidad de cundinamarca soacha, cundinamarca. colombia jarubiano@ucundinamarca.edu.co ceudiel alexis valero portilla sebastien erik benoit dufeu master’s degree in industrial engineering faculty of engineering investigative group (sepro) universidad nacional de colombia bogotá, cundinamarca. colombia. cavaleropor@unal.edu.co sdufeu@unal.edu.co",
35,The Use Of Contingency Reserves To Analyze Risk Response  Actions In Project Management,"risks are part of the nature of projects and risk management is an important component of project management. risks may appear in any moment and aspect of a project, producing schedule delays, cost overruns and even poor quality if they are not effectively managed. risk management process includes the identification and analysis of risks in order to decide risk responses. risk considerations allows the project manager to make decisions related to scope, time or cost baseline during the planning phase and to establish plans to be used during the constructing phase of the project. risk response consists of identifying, evaluating, selecting, and implementing actions in order to reduce the probability of occurrence of the risk or reducing its impact if occurs. while risk analysis through qualitative and quantitative methods is frequently studied, the decision making process related to selecting risk responses is not so studied. there are two main approaches in this topic: the identification of risk responses and the selection of actions to accelerate the project. the proposal is based on four steps: identification of potential risks, identification of critical risks, evaluation of risk impacts and evaluation of risks responses. potential risks are identified through literature review, expert judgment and field research on site. critical risks are identified through a failure mode effect analysis (fmea) which uses occurrence and impact risk dimensions to build a risk score (rs) and the detection dimension to build a risk priority number (rpn). subsequently, there is evaluated the probability and impact of critical risks over the project and simulated trough monte carlo simulation (mcs). finally, response actions are evaluated considering changes in logic network, risk probability and impact, secondary risks and contingency required trough mcs. the proposed method was applied in a highway construction project. a preliminary list of 1,471 risks was reduced to 303 risks by identifying duplicated and some included in others. the fmea allowed to identify 8 critical risks for the project. a literature review allowed to identify 227 potential response actions corresponding to the four generic strategies applied in construction industry: avoid, accept, transfer and mitigate. specific project responses were identified and evaluated according to restrictions such as traffic management, neighborhood relationship, potential safety-casualties, construction method and site space. three responses were identified by the experts: re-design based on additional studies; enhancing project management and working in two work fronts. the simulation was conducted for every response and impacts over the schedule were identified. the application of the method showed advantages over main approaches in selecting risk responses. detailed risk and response analysis allowed to understand their impact over project schedules. a decision process guided by risk 605",,,"alvaro cuadros leonardo rivera phd. school of industrial engineering universidad del valle cali, colombia alvaro.cuadros@correounivalle.edu.co leonardo.rivera.c@correounivalle.edu.co armando orobio phd. school of civil engineering and geomatics universidad del valle cali, colombia armando.orobio@correounivalle.edu.co",
36,Construction Project Scheduling Evaluation Considering  Correlated Risk Analysis,"infrastructure construction is considered the way through economic activities are created and improved in a country. in particular, transport infrastructure is considered a key factor in economic development and represents the link among production centers and consume. however, during the construction of road infrastructure, risky factors may affect the project in such way that the results could be presented in a different way than anticipated by the interested parties. facing risk factors, it is essential for project managers to adopt a rigorous and systematic risk management methodology, which take advantage of experiences in previous projects. risk management usually includes the identification of risk factors, a qualitative or quantitative risk analysis, according to the complexity of the project, the design of risk responses and control during the construction phase of the project. in colombia, road construction suffers frequent scope changes, costs overrun and time delays, due to an inadequate assessment of risk factors. a research project was performed to establish risks factors and categories that affect the normal development of road construction projects in local environment. a long list of risk factors was obtained, so a prioritization process had to be done. in order to be sure not to lose a risk, two different methods were applied. to study the risks impact over projects, a road construction project was selected to apply the risks prioritized. the research project used monte carlo simulation considering the correlation among risks and activities and among risks themselves. the results made it possible to measure the impact of risk factors on activities and project durations, concluding in first place that the project had 0% probability to comply with that established in the contract. in addition, sensitivity analysis allowed to identify specific risks factors that could affect the project, which were contrasted to real performance of the project. in conclusion, it was obtained realistic results when using local risks factors and capturing correlations between the factors considered.","risk management, correlation effect",,"alvaro cuadros david ramirez soto school of industrial engineering universidad del valle cali, colombia alvaro.cuadros@correounivalle.edu.co david.soto@correounivalle.edu.co armando orobio phd. school of civil engineering and geomatics universidad del valle cali, colombia armando.orobio@correounivalle.edu.co",

The general objective was accomplished, reducing 36.51% of the caramel waste, 26.51% more than the general objective established in the definition stage. For the second objective, reducing the average waste in injection process, the reduction was a 31.62%, exceeding initial objective in 19.62%. For the last objective, reduction of average waste in expulsion process, initial objective was surpassed with 43.93%, obtaining a final reduction of 53.93%. It is important to mark that the success of the project was accomplished with the support of the production line leaders, operators, and maintenance technicians due to the valuable information provided by their experience in the field. The involvement of each person in the production plant was a key factor for decision making in the different stages of the project. Empowerment of the experts on the process is essential. The experts are the field operators and production line leaders. Every point of view must be taken into consideration. Departments aspiring and contributing to the same objective have to be involved. One of the project limitations was time, authors only had 4 effective months to develop whole DMAIC phases and improve the process. Measurements were made only in this period of time. A second limitations was automatization tests in the production line. These tests stopped production, in this way authors could not work in the project and waste incremented because of this tests. Despite these limitations, and as seen in the graphs results showed the improvement. And as a final learning, it is crucial that involved parties must have the same objective, so that the solution is systematic. It will lead to better control in the future. A contingency plan must be devised to positively affect all the people involved.

42,Design Of New Plant Layout Using Lean Tools By  Eliminating Wastes In Material Flow Process,"the service mold company examined in this study is leading aerospace parts manufacturing industry located in windsor, ontario. the company demanded a new plant layout for the better material movement to improve the actual productivity by eradicating all the wastes in the process with the help of lean tools. in this paper, the authors analyzed old layout which was in random shape and identified non-value added material movements. authors prepared a new layout based on the present scenario from random layout to u shape layout by utilizing cellular manufacturing to minimize the travel distance of both employees and material. tools like 5w1h, value stream mapping (vsm), cause and effect diagram and 5why are used to find the root cause of the current obstacles. and kaizen tool was used with pareto chart to identify the primary reason for the problem. the future layout is expected to have better productivity in the company.",,"Lean Manufacturing is a systematic tool which is very much useful in identifying and eliminating non-value added activities. In the current process, there is a real root cause in it. It has been identified and eliminated with the help of lean manufacturing techniques. End customer satisfaction will also be improved thereby improving its productivity. By using the cell manufacturing technique, one of the wastes (excessive movement) is removed. So Mura-unevenness., Muri-overburden would be reduced. Inventory of the material is also been reduced by implementing this. Eventually inventory holding cost will not cross its limit. 6.

43,Analysis Of Important Conditions For Supporting Logistics  Cluster Integration,"as a strategy for achieving regional competitiveness, the interest in the cluster approach has become relevant. organizations in similar processes industries are creating synergies to access for more sophisticated services and customers increasing competitiveness and regional prosperity. the purpose of this research is to identify the influence of agglomeration and the readiness to create synergies in some of logistics activities such as transportation services to become more competitive. the northeastern region in mexico, which is very active on international trade operations, have a critical mass of transportation services. the data was gathered from transportation firms’ executives and secondary data sources. the first part of the research is a comparison of the evolution in different regions where these groups of firms have been stablished and their impact in competitiveness according to the occupied personnel, wages and total investment. on the second part, the multivariate linear regression technique was applied, to test the impact of the agglomeration and synergies in the specified region to affect competitiveness. as a result, the statistical significance of geographical allocation of the agglomeration and their intent to create synergies was display to contrast the hypothesis associated to the capabilities of the transportation logistics firms to become a cluster in the selected region.","agglomeration, logistics clusters, competitiveness, regional growth","and Future Research Concerning the interpretation of the results it can be concluded that in the region of NL trucking firms have been affected positively on theirs competitiveness due to increase density in the geographical location (GL), as well as develop synergies through strategic partners (SN) has a negative effect given the profile conditions surveyed companies. This particular case analyzed in the sample collected that companies in the region where the analysis is performed, have very low trust, are not likely to share information and generate synergies to compete. These two constructs as a whole explain and predict a part of the competitiveness dependent variable (R2> 55%). Therefore, according to the results obtained, the conjoint of capabilities for the initial establishment of a logistics cluster in NL region were not totally acknowledged for the trucking companies, in order to increase competitiveness for the cluster members based on joint collaboration. It is recommended to extend this study to other transport modes and for multimodal transport developed regions, such as Bajio region and Estado de Mexico so they can be compared on competitiveness. Finally, we recommend using the technique of Structural Equations (SEM) to implement an exploratory analysis of new variables in order to increase the explained variance by the proposed model, and the significance of new constructs to a greater understanding of the phenomenon behavior.

44,Unravelling The Stereotypes Of Women In Industrial  Engineering,"the study is coming from the premise that the prevalence of standards associated with the male gender role hinders most of the young women to consider building a career in the field of engineering. in line with this epistemology, the study posits that most young women in the philippines are more drawn to a specific type of engineering program rather than considering a variety of engineering discipline as a career option. using qualitative research method, specifically thematic analysis, the study aimed to highlight the prevailing stereotypes of undergraduate students taking up industrial engineering from two of the premier professional technological institutions in the national capital region of the philippines. with an end in view of understanding what shapes the outlook and mentality of students to consider industrial engineering as a degree program, themes gathered from two focused group discussions were used to give meaning to the experience of students in selecting an engineering major in tertiary education. results of the study revealed that students do have a speckled perspective on industrial engineering. the study suggests that generalizations about industrial engineering as a discipline shapes the decision of an incoming undergraduate student to properly identify a suitable engineering program to pursue. the study contributes to the growing number of literature in the fields of engineering education and training, women in non-traditional areas, gender and development, and in general, women in engineering.",,"It is evident by the results displayed in the analysis and interpretations for this study that the prevalence of standards associated with the male gender role indeed hinders most of the young women to consider building a career in the field of engineering.

The proponents conclude that undergraduate female students really do have a speckled perspective on industrial engineering. 5.3 Recommendations Results of this study show that women are indeed drawn to a specific type of engineering program and the researchers recommended that institutions and organizations should create programs that will focus on women empowerment particularly for other engineering fields. It is a kind of need that women should feel the belongingness in other engineering programs not just a specific one to eliminate the gender inequality in engineering that exist in education. Women in engineering organizations will be of great help as interpreted in the study and such organizations should also have continuous or rather more activities and events in the future supporting women that will further encourage them to be drawn to engineering.","elaiza e. bautista, glyda aricon b. marquez, and sheila may p. gappi industrial engineering department technological institute of the philippines 363 p. casal, quiapo metro manila, philippines bautistaisay@gmail.com, glydamarquez@gmail.com, sheilamaygappi11@gmail.com jaypy t. tenerife and maria teresa b. mendoza industrial engineering department technological institute of the philippines 363 p. casal, quiapo metro manila, philippines jaypy.tenerife@tip.edu.ph, mariateresa.mendoza@tip.edu.ph",
45,Design And Development Of An All-Around Air Controller  For A Cost-Efficient Ventilation System And Structure,"the study aims to design and develop an all-around air controller. different design options were considered in order to give consumers the best possible design in terms of functionality, safety, economic and sustainability. four design combinations were made by the proponents that include the skin, skeletal support and filter. the design for functionality was made of polyethylene tarpaulin, round plastic and hepatitis virus (hepa) air filter. next, the design for safety includes polyethylene tarpaulin, round stainless steel and hepa air filter. another design is for economic which uses canvas, round plastic and carbon air filter. the last design is for sustainability that uses waterproof fabric, round plastic and hepa air filter. the proponents used various tools to determine the best design option. in the trade-off analysis, analytical hierarchy process (ahp) was used to determine the best material to be used. it was then determined that the best materials are polyethylene tarpaulin, round plastic and hepa air filter which is the design for functionality. international standards were considered as the top priority in the design project. the proponents made sure that the final design project conforms to applicable codes and standards to ensure the safety of its end users. results of the study suggested that the optimal design combination that satisfied all the specified criteria under different constraints and trade-off is the design for safety. this design uses polyethylene tarpaulin for its tube as it can withstand hot and cold temperatures. the design uses round plastic for its skeletal support since the material is light though its durability is in question since plastics are flimsy. lastly, hepa filter will be used for the filter of the product since it is the most effective among the three to filter-out pollutants in air.","design for safety, design project",,"erna mae antonio, john cheferson de belen, tristan javee gomez, hilario mallari ii, maria teresa b. mendoza industrial engineering department technological institute of the philippines 1338 arlegui street quiapo, manila philippines 1001 ernantonio04@gmail.com, debelenjc@gmail.com, tristanjaveegomez@gmail.com, hgmallariii@yahoo.com, mariateresa.mendoza@tip.edu.ph",
46,Design And Development Of A Convertible Stair-Ramp  System,"this design project aimed to provide a solution that addresses material handling and safety issues. ladders are structures used for going up or down that consist of series of bars or steps between two upright lengths made of metal. rigid ladders, which are self-supporting or leaned in a vertical surface and flexible ladders are hung from the top, are some types of ladders that are commonly used. the design concept of this industrial ladder is that the stairs can be converted into ramp and vice versa, and combined in a single system. the materials used for the design were aluminum, and a jalousie mechanism, which is known to be lightweight yet sturdy and corrosive. the primary function of this ladder is mainly to be a staircase for going up or down, but it can also be converted to a ramp for industrial use. this design project matched with the need for stairs or inclined plane. results of the study suggested that the advantage of the new design over the traditional ladders are: first, it is portable and can be easily transported or carry alone within the trip; second, the material handling, particularly loading and unloading of goods will be more comfortable and safer. since it is convertible to a ramp, the porters can use strollers or forklift that would aid them in carrying the loads to or from the truck, instead of using stairs alone. to create a better and final design, the proponents evaluate different constraints such as environmental, safety, usability, economic and manufacturability, and use technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (topsis) to assess the nine design options.","convertible ladder, design project, slide and ladder",,"jannel lyn f. domondon, rajan paul c. garcia, noriel a. clavo, maria teresa b. mendoza, mary anne c. sevilla industrial engineering department technological institute of the philippines manila janneldomondon@gmail.com, rajangarcia@yahoomail.com, norielclavo@yahoomail.com, maryannesevilla1411@gmail.com, mariateresa.mendoza@tip.edu.ph",

48,An Optimization Strategy For Managing Surplus Electricity  Through P2G Pathways,"ontario has a high dependency on nuclear and renewable energy, with more than 85% of its electricity supplied from non-carbon-based sources. due to the intermittency and inflexibility of the generators, surplus electricity (sbg) is generated when supply exceeds demand. this paper aims to develop a mathematical model for power-to-gas (p2g) energy system, converting sbg into hydrogen to be used by end-users. the four end-users studied were renewable natural gas sector (rng), hydrogen-enriched natural gas sector (heng), mobility sector and industry sector. two scenarios were considered for the model: scenario 1, where a single pathway was considered for implementation and scenario 2, where the four pathways were integrated into one system for a combined installment. the objective of this model is to minimize the total cost and maximize emission offset with a lifetime of 20 years. the modelling and optimization were carried out in python using mixed integer linear programming (milp) based approach. the scenario 1 results showed that replacing industry feedstock by hydrogen is more cost-efficient than other sectors. the scenario 2 results showed that the system can reduce 470,595 tonnes of co2 per year, which is 95% of the maximum achievable offset and utilize 57% of the surplus electricity.","power-to-gas, hydrogen economy","Based on the scenario 1 model results, the most dominant component contributing to the capital cost (CAPEX) is hydrogen storage tanks across all pathways. The second largest cost is PEM electrolyzers in all pathways except for the transportation pathway. The most dominant component contributing to annual operating cost (OPEX) is purchasing electricity for all four pathways. There is also a significant cost regarding purchasing carbon dioxide gas for methanation reaction for RNG. Based on the cost per emission offset, the industry pathway seemed to be the most efficient in terms of achieving the greatest reduction in carbon emission with a given budget. Based on the scenario 2 model results, the model required 1,705 electrolyzers, 1,386 pre-storage compressors, and 514 booster compressors, 74,533 storage tanks at the total lifetime cost of 47.5 billion dollars and achieved an emission reduction of 470,595 tonnes of carbon dioxide per year of operation, which is 95% of the maximum achievable offset. Notably, the cost of the combined system is greater than the sum of the costs of the individual systems from Scenario 1, which was 39.6 billion dollars. This was due to more storage units being required as the hours with little to no surplus generation required a greater amount of hydrogen production at once in the combined model, which meant that a larger volume of hydrogen had to be stored in previous hours. On the other hand, if one pathway within the combined model had to be chosen for expansion, the industry pathway would be the best choice, as it is the most efficient pathway to achieve the lowest unit cost per emission offset.","lingyi gu, jeeyoung kim, joohyung ko, azadeh maroufmashat, michael fowler and ali elkamel department of chemical engineering, university of waterloo, 200 university avenue west, waterloo, ontario n2l 3g1, canada",
49,Stator Teeth Pairing Design Optimization Of Dual Radial  Flux Permanent Magnet Generator For Cogging Torque,"wind energy has been growing fast and is recognized as the most successful energy source among all the alternative energy sources. however, due to the low utilization rate, the spread of small-scale wind power generator is progressing slowly. in this paper, the stator teeth pairing design is studied to reduce the cogging torque of the dual radial flux permanent magnet generator for small scale wind turbines. the proposed method is capable to minimize the characteristic deterioration due to cogging torque reduction through an asymmetric design of teeth width. the proposed design method is verified through finite element analysis.",,"The aim of this study is to minimize the cogging torque of DRFPMG through a stator teeth pairing optimization. As a result of optimization, the cogging torque is reduced about 67[%] compared with the initial model.

54,The Prospect Of Smart-Remanufacturing In Automotive  Smes: A Case Study,"the manufacturing sector is the second largest sector after agriculture in pakistan. it represents 15.3% of the total workforce. to strengthen the large-scale industrialization with respect to economy and employment in manufacturing, small and medium enterprises (smes) act as a source. achieving sustainability for manufacturing smes is a great challenge since they do not comply with the economic, social, and environmental objectives of sustainability. product remanufacturing and reuse are appropriate strategies for bringing sustainability to economically growing countries such as pakistan where consumption of resources (i.e. materials, energy etc.) is of crucial consideration. moreover, industry 4.0 revolution unlocked the potential of remanufacturing by giving the concept of smart factory design and smart services. it is good to note that the development of the remanufacturing industry is still undercover, neglected, and environmentally unfriendly, which become the main focus of this current research. this article includes a case study which enlightens the existing situation of auto-part remanufacturing in pakistan. it presents a framework for sustainable manufacturing assessment of the existing remanufactured product to make it technically, economically, environmentally, and socially sustainable. the sustainable manufacturing criteria for assessment used during this current study are reliability, employment, life-cycle cost, and green environment. lastly, it is also to exemplify how technology facilitators from industry 4.0 can impact the automotive remanufacturing. this research will provide a leading-edge to the automotive smes through proposing a sustainable manufacturing assessment model and integrated improvement framework. this will address the socio-economic and the environmental objectives of remanufacturing in pakistan.","sustainability, remanufacturing, smes",,"sadaf zahoor and walid abdul-kader department of mechanical, automation and materials engineering university of windsor windsor, canada sadaf@uwindsor.ca, kader@uwindsor.ca mohammad zain and amjad hussain and muhammad salman habib department of industrial and manufacturing engineering university of engineering and technology lahore, pakistan mzain12@gmail.com",
55,Sustainability Issues In Sputtering Deposition Technology,"sputtering involves ejection of atoms from a surface upon impingement by energetic ions generated by a plasma. the plasma is created by a large potential difference (2 kv) between the cathode and anode in vacuum and it contains both electrons and ions. these ions get accelerated towards the target (cathode) to eject the adatoms of the target that deposits onto the substrate to form a thin film. the deposition rate of sputtering depends on the plasma density; higher plasma density increases the ions involved in bombardment of the target. like any other manufacturing process, sputtering technology is associated with sustainability aspects such as control of the plasma density, input potential voltage and current, efficiency of sputtering (sputtering yield, mean free path), cooling system (input water and cooling power), temperature (substrate and target) and maintenance of the sputtering systems. issues of production rates, automation and mass production are also very important for sustainable manufacturing process including sputtering technology. optimization of the process parameters for deposition of specific films should consider these sustainability issues. this article highlights these sustainable issues with an effort to evaluate the sustainability of sputtering as a thin film deposition technology using hhv tf500 thin film deposition system as a case study.","parameters, sputtering, sustainable","Sustainability aspects of sputtering as a novel manufacturing process of thin and thick films have been identified and described. In studying sustainability of sputtering, the following topics ought to be considered: • The interplay between the processing parameters (pressures, power, temperature, cooling, flowrates, voltage, etc.) and the energy utilization of the facility. Optimization of the processes should also consider the energy consumption of the system in addition to the quality of the films. • The material and maintenance of the system in relationship to wastage, safety, environment and cost. The choice of the target and substrate materials should go beyond the mere application of the deposited films-should account for safety, reduced waste, clean environment, cost effectiveness and safety. • In line of industry 4.0, these systems are automated and exhibit routine flexibility. Machine flexibility and material handling processes should be enhanced.

56,Exploring The Effect Of Rf Power In Sputtering Of  Aluminum Thin Films-A Microstructure Analysis,"in this article, a detailed image analysis on the field emission scanning electron microscopy of aluminum thin films sputtered on stainless steel substrates was presented. the effect of rf power on the structural and topography characteristics of the films was described. the physical observations of the surface micrographs, quantitative particle size and distribution, fractal dimensions, average surface roughness and widths of the multifractal spectra of all the films were related to the change in rf power. there existed a correlation between increasing rf power and fractal dimension and multifractal spectrum whereas there was no relationship established between power and height roughness of the films. fractal and multifractal approaches appeared to provide better description of the effect of rf power on the sputtered al thin films.","aluminum thin film, sputtering, temperature","Aluminum thin films were deposited on stainless steel substrates via RF magnetron sputtering (HHV TF500) facility at RF powers of 150, 200, 250 and 350 W for 2 hrs. The films were characterized by FESEM and optical surface profilometry techniques. The surface microstructure, topography and structure distribution were described. It was reported that RF power does not exhibit direct relationship with average roughness, particle size and circularity. However, RF power was shown to have a correlation with one-dimensional fractal dimension and the widths of multifractal spectrum.

59,Multi-Feature Usability Testing On Internet Of Things-Based  Smart Gym Machine With All In One Concept Using,"usability testing is needed to know whether a product can fulfill the desires of its customers or not. a product that has good usability will have good prospects because technically the product is feasible to use. this study aims to test the usability of a new innovative product called gym atom ""gym machine with artificial trainer and automatic load modifier"". the three newest features of the gym machine are the gym machine is designed with the all in one concept where 1 machine can not only train 1 muscle but can train 7 different muscles, also having an artificial trainer that allows users to practice even though without a companion trainer, and automatic load modifier which is based on internet of things that use the user's voice input and it is converted into mechanical energy to change the load. until now, gym atom has been produced and has reached the alpha prototype stage. to reach the beta prototype stage until it can be mass produced, the product needs to be evaluated for its usability. so that the aim of this study is to test the usability level of gym atom with multi-feature testing by using nielsen’s heuristics where usability criteria are measured based on the criteria of learnability, efficiency, memorability, errors, and satisfaction. based on the results of the usability testing, it can be concluded that the total score of usability is 80.667% which is very good usability. but the product still has to be improved because it has a fairly high error percentage on the automatic load modifier feature. this is because the users must use english as their voice input while respondents are indonesian who are not fluent in english so it is difficult to use if the user is not good at speaking english. as an evaluation, the product needs to be improved by developing its voice input system so that voice input can not only be used with english but also in languages that are in accordance with the capabilities of its users so that it has better usability.","gym machine, multi-feature, internet of things","Based on the discussion above, it can be concluded that the results of usability testing for GYM ATOM product using Nielsen's Heuristics method which is tested for 3 innovative features namely all in one concept, artificial trainer, and automatic load modifier has the total score of usability is 80.667% which is very good usability level. However, as an evaluation in the future, it needs to be improved for the automatic load modifier feature because it produces a fairly high error rate. This is because these features can only be used using English while the respondents are Indonesian who are not fluent in English. So it is necessary to repair the automatic load modifier system so that it can be used according to the user's language. After repairs, GYM ATOM is ready to be produced at the beta prototype stage and mass produced. 760","nielsen’s heuristics zakka ugih rizqi department of industrial engineering islamic university of indonesia yogyakarta, indonesia ugihzakka@gmail.com","References

60,Identification Of Dominant Customer Behavior Patterns  Among Different Sectors Over Time;,"understanding and predicting customers’ behaviors in customer-centric organizations such as banks are very critical. the aim of identifying customers is to recognize, make distinction, and maintain the high-value customers and to attract more beneficial customers. in the past, the separation of customers into different groups was based on customer requirements, whereas customer value has become more important as segmentation criteria in recent years. offering cutting-edge banking services, banks’ competition on market share, as well as the psychological and environmental factors of customers’ behavior need to be analyzed over time. transferring customers to different sectors over time and discovering the dominant models and their displacements between sectors are explored in this paper. we aim to identify the behavioral patterns and the leading characteristics of customer displacements with a focus on the customers of a private bank in tehran, iran. for this purpose, we propose a combined method based on clustering and association rules. results show four dominant clusters of behaviors: ""low-value customers with sustainable model"", ""low-value customer with unsustainable profitability model"", ""turned away customers with average profitability"", ""loyal customers with low profitability"". we also analyze the relationships between these clusters. the outcomes of this study can play a remarkable role for top managers to take appropriate marketing strategies.","segmentation, association rules","In this paper, we presented a new hybrid K-Means and association rule method that identifies behavior groups of customers over time and analyzes characteristics of these group. Majority of previous studies applied markov chains to model customers’ movement among different sectors and few studies have been conducted in the context of dominant displacement patterns. In previous researches, the dominant patterns were extracted using the maximum number of available sequences and frequency without any systematic and qualitative approach. In this paper, we developed a new extraction and clustering sequence approach as a general way of identifying dominant behavioral patterns of different customer groups among sectors. Identification and analysis of behavioral groups can come handy in developing productive marketing strategies. In addition to the cases mentioned in this paper, the behavioral characteristics of different customer groups were evaluated in order to explore the dominant patterns pertaining to the demographic characteristics of customer groups. According to the proposed method, four groups of customer behavior were identified as; “Low- value customers with a sustainable pattern”, “Low-value customers with stable profitability pattern”, “Turned away customers with average value”, and “Loyal customers with low 772","a case study shaya sheikh* department of operations and supply chain management new york institute of technology ny, usa ssheik11@nyit.edu vahid kayvanfar department of industrial engineering amirkabir university of technology tehran, iran v.kayvanfar@aut.ac.ir iman gharib department of management and economic, science and research branch, islamic azad university tehran, iran imangharib@yahoo.com sahar bigdeli department of management, economic and accounting, islamic azad university of tabriz tabriz, iran bigdeli.sahar85@gmail.com","References

62,"Vehicle Routing Challenges In The Automotive Supply Chain  Robert R. Inman,","this paper describes an open and vital vehicle routing research opportunity. we describe the pervasive vehicle routing problems (vrps) automakers use for three different links in their supply chains. our research methodology was to analyze an automaker’s logistics problems to identify the most relevant vrp characteristics and search the vrp literature for contributions addressing those characteristics. arguably the most challenging automotive vrp is parts collection for which we detail the key problem characteristics of capacitated trucks, periodic schedules and stochastic volumes. we provide industrial data on the routes, supplier volumes and locations. this shows the large scale of automotive vrps and characterizes the randomness in the daily shipping volumes. we observe that the daily volumes are stochastic with generally positively skewed distributions and positive autocorrelation. since the large-scale automotive vrps would be computationally intractable for the existing methods on capacitated vrps with stochastic volumes, research applied to the automotive industry typically assumes deterministic volumes. since we observed meaningful randomness in the supplier volumes, this identifies a need for research on periodic capacitated vrps that are both stochastic and large-scale. this paper’s data will serve as a test-bed for future research on this important problem facing the automotive industry.","milkrun, capacitated, periodic, stochastic, data 776",,"chief data and analytics office general motors company warren, mi 48092, usa robert.inman@gm.com rana afzali-baghdadabadi and baiyang liu global purchasing and supply chain general motors company warren, mi 48092, usa rana.afzali@gm.com, baiyang.liu@gm.com","References

63,An Affordable And Portable Technology For Real-Time  Scheduling Of Appliances In Smart Homes,"the objective of the paper is to motivate the readers towards finding implementable internet of things based solutions to existing well-researched engineering problems. towards this end, this paper describes a portable and easy to use technology to enable consumers to shift their electricity consumption to times when the prices are low. this technology can be implemented on a platform that consists of a belkin wemo smart plug (wemo), which can be autonomously turned on/off using an intel edison (edison) through a wifi connection. we use a simple markov model for predicting the real-time prices. based on the predicted prices, a threshold-based policy is used for scheduling of devices. the choice of model and the scheduling algorithm is heavily influenced by the processing- and storage-capacity of this platform. empirical analysis on real-data from commonwealth edison (comed), which is the largest electric utility in illinois, shows that 90% of times, the customer paid no more than 1.5-1.6 times the omniscient- minimum electricity bill for a particular device usage requirement.","smart homes, internet of things","We worked under the teleological model that the DAHP has taken into account everything that could possibly be predicted before the day commences (cf. the ``slow dynamics'' discussion in Section 3). The RTHP is essentially the DAHP with additional ``fast dynamics'' that are explicated at the last minute. This helped us to make the prediction- algorithm tractable on the Edison. We used a Markov Model to predict the prices. Although we convert the prices into a finite state-space of a reasonable size, such an action inherently introduces inaccuracies in price prediction. For example: assume that the price at 6:00PM is 8 cents per kWh, and that 𝑚𝑎𝑥𝑇= 10. The model will treat the two cases: 1) price at 6:05PM is 25 cents per kWh, and 2) price at 6:05PM is 10 cents per kWh, as being identical. Therefore, it always underestimates high prices. Similarly, it will always overestimate low prices. We assume that the effect of fast-factors lasts only for 5-minutes. Because of these assumptions we could limit the size of the state space to around 100, and to around 10! entries in the transition probability matrix 𝐴. For illustration, suppose each entry in 𝐴 is stored as type double (in C++ terminology), which has a size of 8 bytes. Then we need ~80kB of size to store the matrix, which is fairly small. Now, if we relax our assumption and assume that the effect of fast-factors lasts for 10 minutes, then for the Markovian assumption to hold we will have to raise the current state-space to the space where each state is a two-tuple (𝑝! !, 𝑝! !!!). This would result in a space of size approximately 10!, and 𝐴 will have 10! entries which would need around 800MB of space. We also assume that the probability distribution of prices is stationary. As discussed in Section 1, the stationarity assumption is not necessarily true if we have to predict the prices. We then argued in Section 3 that since we only have to select the cheapest hours, any model would work as long it predicts the relative ranks of the hourly prices accurately. This peculiarity gives us room for making the assumption. That said, we can remove this assumption in two ways. The first way is to estimate different transition matrices to be used during different times of the day, which will be a direct extension of this work. The second way is to raise the state space in a way similar to one discussed in the previous paragraph. We would need a 3 or 4-tuple state (the other elements of the state being past hourly prices) to reliably account for stationarity. We end up with a state explosion problem. As we receive more 5-minute prices for a given hour, the predicted hourly prices become more reliable. But if the consumer waits for a relatively reliable estimate, she loses out on the amount of time she can charge in the given hour. We have not encoded the risk-taking tendencies of consumers in this algorithm. Since we are looking at the solution from the perspective of the consumer, it is not clear how to pose the scheduling as an optimization problem for minimizing the cost due to the electricity price and hours lost. We have to consider 798","a. raman, r. sowers and r. s. sreenivas department of industrial and enterprise systems engineering university of illinois at urbana-champaign urbana, il 61801, usa raman12@illinos.edu, r-sowers@illinois.edu, rsree@illinois.edu","References

65,Influence Of Nanostructured-Tic Coating On The Mechanical  Properties Of Ti6Al4V Alloys Grown By Rf Magnetron,"hard coating ceramics are gaining prominent applications in many industries due to their astonishing and favourable properties. titanium alloys are regarded as the material of the 21st century with excellent mechanical and metallurgical properties. titanium and its alloys have the ability to form a protective oxide that prevents it from susceptibility to corrosion in the presence of oxygen but has poor wear-resistant. coating with tic will enhance the surface properties and increases its application life span and range. in this research work, tic ceramic coating was deposited on the surface of commercially pure titanium using rf magnetron sputtering. the behaviour of the evolving mechanical properties was characterized using different mechanical characterization techniques. nanoindentation was used to determine the hardness and young modulus. the coefficient of friction was also investigated using a tribometer. the hardness of the coating was improved, and the lowest coefficient of friction was found at the highest hardness value.","hardness, rf sputtering, titanium carbide","From the experimental observation, it can be concluded that the process parameters affect the mechanical properties of the TiC thin film coating. The hardness improves with increase in temperature and the same trend was noticed for the Young Modulus. The COF of the TiC thin film coatings reduces as the harness of the film increase and delamination of the films were noticed under micrographic observation.

67,Evaluating Impacts Of Coal Mining In South African  Stephen Akinwale Akinlabi And Madindwa P. Mashinini,"south africa is considered as one of the ten largest coal producers and the fourth largest coal exporting country in the world. the above claim perfectly confirms the importance of the coal mining industry to the country economy. with increasing dependency of the country on coal resource for power generation, all indications show that coal exploration in the country will not be abated in near time. the exploration, however, has detrimental effects both on the flora and the fauna as well as the humans. this study, therefore, evaluates the impacts of coal mining in south africa relative to achieving society 4.0 in the country. mpumalanga province was used as a case study as mining activities are highly prevalent in this area. impacts of the mining activities on air pollution and water pollution were reviewed in the study area. the study further develops a roadmap towards achieving society 4.0 in the era of societal revolution, thus achieving the low carbon global paradigm shift. this study concludes on the need for cleaner substitute for coal in the country as a long-term recommendation and on a short-term sustainability scale, we discourage opencast mining and encourage underground mining of the resource.","coal mining, society 4.0","Coal product is considered as the most important source of energy around the world’s and in South Africa near 90% of energy come from coal product. Coal for the next 50 years will remain the most useful product to produce electricity, before that each country develops electricity with natural resources and new technology advanced to generate electricity. The natural resources to create electricity reduces the use of coal product that negatively impacts the environmental elements such as water pollution, soil destruction, land subsidence, air, ecosystem, animals and human being.

68,Risk Investigation In Non-Compliance Of Organizational  Processes And Staffs With Strategy Implementations,"business processes are closely associated with improvements in increased productivity and profitability. keeping the “content” the same but changing the strategy has often been the approach of many service industries towards strategy implementation. however, non-compliance of employees to an organization’s business process towards implementation of a strategy has its associated risks. this study, therefore, investigates some of the associated risks in non-compliance to business process in a typical banking system in south africa using primary and secondary data sources. this study used qualitative approach through the administration of questionnaires to 100 employees across all relevant segment in the selected commercial bank. these questionnaires were aimed at investigating alignment of business processes to the strategy to be implemented, staff adherence to business processes within their unit, evaluation of business processes in a business unit in the typical bank and evaluation of business process role on individual jobs. data obtained from secondary sources like criminal investigations, financial loss data, audit data and process maturity dashboards were analysed. the study reveals that business processes are fundamental to any strategy. it is evident that not complying with the laid down business processes result in financial loss, which was as high as r29 million for process breaches and reputational risk for the case study used. processes that are not documented make it difficult for risk managers to proactively identifying risks and controls. the study concludes with several recommendations on the business process towards risk minimization and profit maximization in an active competition between banking industries.","business process, financial loss, non-compliance, risk","and Recommendations This study investigated the effect non-conformance of business processes and staffs to strategy implementation in service industry using a bank as a case study. The questionnaire and the investigation of reports were carried out in this study. Although the response was low, some good insights were gained from the employees that responded. The poor response can also be attributed to the fact that employees are very busy and must have blocked their emails from receiving surveys. A larger percentage of the processes involved in the daily operations of employees are not efficient and effective as they were. Thus, a process-re-engineering is highly essential if the bank will increase its profit as well as be able to compete with their counterparts in the banking sector. Some of the business processes do not positively affect business unit under which they are performed. This also requires eliminating non-value adding business processes in the system. The study focuses on identifying some associated risks of non-compliance of organizations processes on strategy implementation. Although most business enterprises such as commercial banks aim at making profit, this study reveals that the commercial bank investigated incurred financial losses following non-compliances of their processes and employees to strategy implementation. The study revealed that the bank lost a total of R333 million in the last financial year of which R 29 million was directly linked to process breaches.","virginia harris and charles mbohwa department of quality & operations management, university of johannesburg, south africa virginia19@me.com, cmbohwa@uj.ac.za stephen akinwale akinlabi and madindwa p. mashinini department of mechanical & industrial engineering, university of johannesburg, south africa & department of mechanical engineering, covenant university ota, nigeria stephenakinlabi@gmail.com, madindwap@gmail.com paul a. adedeji, olawale s. fatoba and esther t. akinlabi department of mechanical engineering science, university of johannesburg, south africa pauladedeji2k5@gmail.com, drfatobasameni@gmail.com, etakinlabi@gmail.com",

73,Empirical Modeling And Multi-Attribute Optimization Of  Al7075 Using Response Surface Methodology-Based,"this research reports the optimization of milling process for al7075 aerospace alloy under dry cutting conditions employing response surface methodology (rsm). the influence of various control parameters such as spindle speed (rpm), feed rate (ƒz) and axial depth of cut (ap) are examined to improve the surface roughness (ra) and the material removal rate (mrr). a set of 20 test trials using a circumscribed central composite design (cccd) is utilized for the design of experimentation (doe). the second-order polynomial regression equations are developed to predict the response attributes. in addition, the rsm- based parametric and variance exploration is made to quantify the effects of milling variables on the output characteristics. lastly, the rsm-based desirability function is adopted for multi-attribute optimization. by applying this approach, the following have been obtained: a minimum ra of 0.26 µm and maximum mrr of 2196e+04 mm3/min at the spindle speed 2577.32 rpm, the ƒz 531.650 mm/min, and the ap 4.6330 mm.","al7075, surface roughness","With the aim to improve productivity and reduce the manufacturing cost of Al7075 for aerospace applications, multi- attribute optimization for surface roughness and material removal rate has been carried out using RSM-based Desirability Function. After the main effect analysis, ANOVA and discussion, the following findings are inferred: I. The second-ordered regression equations for surface roughness and material removal rate have demonstrated a good correlation between experimental values since the predicted values are within the acceptable error of 15% and 0.89%, respectively. II. With respect to surface roughness, the spindle speed has the most pronounced effect with 90.50% contribution. Moreover, the main effect plots show that 4000 rpm spindle speed, 400 mm/min ƒz, and 4 mm ap enables the dry milling operation to produce smaller Ra under the dry machining conditions. III. For the material removal rate, the axial depth of cut is the most influential variable with 89.95% contribution followed by the feed rate with 9.5% contribution. However, the spindle speed was found statistically insignificant for MRR. IV. Multi-attribute optimization has been successfully carried out for the dry milling of Al7075 with an optimal desirability value 1 utilizing RSM-based Desirability Function. Minimum Ra 0.26 µm and maximum MRR 2196E+04 mm3/min can be obtained at spindle speed 2577.32 rpm, feed rate 531.650 mm/min, and axial depth of cut 4.6330 mm.","desirability approach sadaf zahoor and walid abdul-kader department of mechanical, automotive, and materials engineering university of windsor windsor, n9b 3p4, canada sadaf@uwindsor.ca, kader@uwindsor.ca adeel shehzad, muhammad zain, shoaib muzaffar, hamza ijaz department of industrial and manufacturing engineering university of engineering and technology lahore, pakistan",
74,A Data-Driven Analytical Model For Predicting Functional  Loss And Recovery Among Older Adults,"the number of nursing home residents who need help with their functional health, i.e., ability to perform the activities of daily living, adls, is constantly increasing. clinicians, patients, and their caregivers would benefit from information on likely next adl events (both progression and recovery). while much of the focus in long-term care and the nursing home is on preservation and restoration of these activities, very little information is available to guide patients, providers, families, and policymakers regarding expectations for the sequence, likelihood, and timing of functional loss and recovery. predictive modeling, particularly machine learning, and availability of large data enables clinicians and patients to better understand what is likely to occur next. these forecasts can also set priorities for clinical interventions. predictive modeling could also be used for planning purposes as it provides quantitative information on the timing and severity of the next disability event. caregivers would like to know how long they need to provide care. families would like to understand the likely quality of life of their loved one. the objective of this study is to provide a data-driven analytical model, based on machine learning techniques, for predicting functional status change for residents in long term care facilities. particularly, we predict: 1. the sequence in which adls were lost and recovered using large longitudinal data, 2. the days between adl loss and recovery from these losses, 3. the likelihood of loss and improvement. this information can help in planning for end-of-life disabilities. it can also be used to set “pay for improvement” incentives for providing long term care to older adults. the sequence of functional loss and recovery among long term care residents is accurately predictable. this study provides benchmarks for the sequence, likelihood, transitions, and timing between various combinations of adl deficits. while the majority of patients were able to recover from adl deficits, the mean recovery time from a single adl deficit suggests that recovery occurs over a long period and care planning needs predicting such timelines. this information can also be used to pay more for long term care facilities that perform better than average. in these payment systems, the percentage of patients that improved their condition is compared to the average percentage and additional payments are provided for the facilities that report better than average improvement rates.","aging, planned care",,"mahsa madani hosseini ted rogers school of management ryerson university 55 dundas st w, toronto, on m5g 2c3, canada mahsa.madani@ryerson.ca manaf zargoush health policy and management, degroote school of business mcmaster university 1280 main street west., hamilton, l8s 4l8, canada zargoush@mcmaster.ca farrokh alemi department of health adm. & policy george mason university 4400 university drive, ms:1j3 northeast module i fairfax, va 22030-4444, usa falemi@gmu.edu",

78,Impact Of A Cloud-Based Applied Supply Chain Network  Simulation Tool On Developing Systems Thinking Skills Of,"as modern supply chains continue to evolve into increasingly integrated global networks, logistics decisions that balance customer value with cost are becoming more complex. due to the dynamic nature of a supply chain system, the interrelationships between decision-making criteria are not always obvious to individuals who are preparing for careers in logistics and supply chain management, resulting in decisions being conceptualized and framed in terms of linear cause-and-effect paradigms. since a logistician must be able to view the supply chain as a system to design the resources, flows, and solutions that support an organization’s competitive strategy, learning tools that stimulate holistic thinking in regard to logistics can be helpful in developing an individual’s systems thinking skills. the purpose of this research is to evaluate the impact of a cloud-based, applied simulation of a global supply chain on students’ ability to think in systemic terms. responses to questions examining various systems thinking competencies are evaluated based on a two-wave longitudinal study, before and after the simulation, to determine the impact on holistic thinking skills of students. the research’s results show several significant relationships between students’ systems thinking skills in the pre-test and post-test.","logistics, supply chain, system thinking, simulation",,"undergraduate students jeanne-marie lawrence, niamat ullah ibne hossain, morteza nagahi, raed jaradat department of industrial and systems engineering mississippi state university starkville, ms 39759, usa jel487@msstate.edu, ni78@msstate.edu, mn852@msstate.edu, jaradat@ise.msstate.edu","References

79,Developments In Conventional Machining For Sustainabilitya State Of Art Review,"conventional machining processes such as turning, drilling, and milling are basic material removal type cutting techniques used commercially to produce a wide range of parts, components, and products. when it comes on their use for precision machining, cutting of difficult-to-machine (dtm) materials, processing of micro-components, and making typical shapes and intecrate features, they underperform and result in poor machinability, escalated machining cost, and high environmental footprints. even under normal operating conditions, it may result in high consumption of energy and resources; generation of toxic fumes, particulate emissions and other wastes; risk for health and safety; high tool wear, and deterioration in the machined part surface quality. innovative sustainable techniques such as dry and near dry (minimum quantity lubrication and cryogenic) machining, tool treatment and texturing, heat assisted machining etc. have been developed to overcome the machinability and sustainability challenges in conventional machining. this review article presents a state of the art on development of these sustainable techniques for economic and ecological benefits in conventional machining processes. the main objective of this paper is to facilitate researchers and academics by providing useful information in order to establish the field further.","cryogenic, dry-cutting, energy, environment, machinability",,"kapil gupta department of mechanical and industrial engineering technology university of johannesburg johannesburg, republic of south africa kgupta@uj.ac.za","References

80,Analysis And Optimization Of Surface Roughness While  Machining Ss304 Using Green Lubricant,"stainless steels (ss) are used in a variety of precision, scientific, and industrial applications. all demand excellent surface properties for better functional performance of the products made by ss. analysis, modeling, and optimization of machining of ss can result in process parameter combinations which facilitate to obtain better surface properties while machining ss using conventional processes. this paper reports the investigation on surface roughness (mean roughness depth) of ss304 machined by conventional turning using tialn/tin coated tools under the influence of green lubricant. in this work total nine experiments with two replicates each have been conducted by varying three important machining parameters i.e. cutting speed, depth of cut, and feed rate at three levels each. a detailed effect of process parameters on mean roughness depth is discussed. analysis of variance study is also reported. process parameter optimization resulted in the optimum value 4.81 µm of mean roughness depth.","lubrication, machinability, machining, roughness","In this paper, an investigation on analysis and optimization of surface roughness during turning of SS304 by coated tools and under the influence of green cutting fluid is reported. Effects of machining parameters on mean roughness depth, results of ANOVA study, and optimization of machining parameters for surface finish improvement are discussed. The following conclusions can be drawn from this work- 1. Depth of cut was identified as the most significant parameter with a percentage contribution of 36.38% followed by fed rate- 33.21% and cutting speed- 30.26%. 2. Analysis of the results presented that optimum parameter combination i.e. cutting speed-170m/min, feed rate- 0.1mm/rev and depth of cut- 0.5mm corresponds minimum Rz. 3. Confirmation experiment conducted at optimal parameter setting resulted in optimum value of Rz- 4.81 µm. In essence, it can be concluded that machinability challenges of SS304 type difficult-to-machine materials can be overcame by sustainable techniques where green cutting fluids possess the capability to prevent excessive tool wear and generate good surface quality along with keeping the environment clean and green.

84,Lean Management And Analysis An Empirical Study Of A  Traditional Shipbuilding Industry In Indonesia,"indonesian shipbuilding industry is a labor intensive business. there are several stages and activities in shipbuilding that needs process efficiency and cost reduction. in this study, we implement the lean management to eliminate waste and create value. we start by identifying the critical wastes in the traditional shipbuilding industry. subsequently, we prioritize the waste using analytical hierarchy process and investigate the source and reason by fishbone diagram. the result showed that the process of dropping the ship into the sea that causes the bottom of the ship break down is the most critical waste. several root causes are analyzed by fishbone diagram, such as: men, material, method, and environment. based on the results of the risk priority number assessment, it can be inferred the highest priority of broken-down vessel that is the rocky environmental conditions when the ship drops to sea. the lowest priority is the limitation of equipment, which causes the process of dropping ships to sea not straight. furthermore, all the main causes are given an improvement proposal in order to minimize the risk of the bottom of the ship break down during the process of dropping ship to sea.","lean management, (2) inventory","and Implications We have described the waste activities in building traditional boats. All of waste activities are classified into 6 wastes. By using AHP, we found that the process of dropping the ship into the sea that causes the bottom of the ship break down is the most critical waste. Several root causes are analyzed by fishbone diagram, such as: men, material, method, and environment. Based on the results of the RPN assessment, it can be prioritized the main cause of broken-down vessel that is the rocky environmental conditions when the ship drops to sea. The lowest priority is the limitation of equipment, which causes the process of the ships dropping into the sea to be not straight. Furthermore, all the main causes are given an improvement proposal in order to minimize the risk of the bottom of the ship break down during the process of the ships dropping into the sea.

85,Forecast Model For Return Quality In Reverse Logistics  Networks,"giving rise to the field of reverse logistics are legislations mandating the take-back and recovery of products, causing high costs for manufacturers but no guaranteed profitability. one way to tackle this challenge is to demystify the multi-faceted uncertainties of product returns namely timing, volume and quality, that currently inhibit optimality of reverse logistics networks (rln). one contributor to this risk is the uncertainty in the quality level of used electronics caused by variations in consumer usage behaviors. it would be useful if businesses could have data about the expected quality levels of future returns for efficient planning of rln design and resource allocation. the objective of this thesis is to develop a quantitative model that can estimate the return quality of future electronics returns. the applicability of this model lies in enabling reprocessors to strategically design an rln with the optimal number, capacity and location of the necessary facilities, with the aim of reducing the risks of costly investments, while facilitating rlns that are both, environmentally and economically viable. while significant literature on forecast of volume and timing of returned products exists, there is scare work on forecasting of return quality. additionally, significant literature explores the use of iot, rfid and prognostic health monitoring (phm) systems, characteristic of industry 4.0, as a method of using life cycle data to predict return quality. however, it can be argued that these costly methods can only be justified for products with long life spans. as an alternative for short-lived products, this thesis develops a forecast model for return quality based on consumer behavior trends. the proposed forecast model incorporates three major factors that affect quality: usage, technological age, and remaining economic value of expected returns. the novelty of the model lies in deducing usage distributions through segmentation of the consumers by three socioeconomic factors: age, income, and location. these usage distributions are used to estimate remaining life of returns, the associated recovery costs and the subsequent profitability based on economic market trends. firstly, the methodology involves establishing a correlation between relevant socioeconomic factors and smartphone usage behaviors through statistical tests of association. to this end, empirical data from surveys has been used to derive trends between the response variables, smartphone usage and purchase behavior, and the independent variables, which are the socioeconomic factors. secondly, a complex system of equations is developed incorporating usage level and time-based secondary market value trends of the product. they determine the most feasible quality level of a unit based on expected profit that can be derived from it through the streams of direct reuse, refurbishing, parts harvest, or materials recycling. for demonstration of the model, a random sample of smartphone returns based on consumers in canada, generated using monte carlo methods, is input into the forecast model to predict the output- which is the distribution of return quality from the collections in canadian cities. the results of this thesis can be used by original equipment manufacturers, government or third party reprocessors, to design a more efficient rln by providing them information on what quality levels to expect from the used smartphones.","reverse logistics, return quality, smartphones, forecast 941",,"aamirah mohammed ashraf and walid abdul kader department of mechanical, automotive and materials engineering university of windsor windsor, on n9b 3p4, canada moham13d@uwindsor.ca, kader@uwindsor.ca",
86,Integrating Blockchain In Nuclear Fuel Supply Chains For  Transparency Of Hazardous Materials Flow,"blockchain technology is a systematic record-keeping of data, termed “ledger-keeping”, such that once a record is created, it is saved on multiple servers, shared with all parties on the network, and locked to disable tampering. the core competencies that govern blockchain are transparency, immutability (tamper-proof) and decentralization. these features of blockchain present a powerful solution to eliminate the transparency issues that currently plague nuclear supply chains and inhibit effective risk management. risk management of nuclear supply chains is critical because it involves transport of fuel materials that can potentially be developed into nuclear weapons. the supply chain of nuclear fuel is a multi-stage process in which the raw material suppliers, fuel processers, and end-users (reactors) are commonly located across multiple countries. each stage of transportation is prone to the risk of unauthorized removal of fuel material from the shipment. heightening this risk is the lack of visibility of material during international transport. such long transit times allow for any event of theft to go unnoticed until the shipment reaches the destination. for detection of theft, the iaea calls for measurements and record-keeping of the gross weight of each shipment at every shipper’s and receiver’s end, at every tier of the supply chain, a procedure known as nuclear material accounting. a second risk is that these record entries can be tampered with, even by authorized workers, for concealment of theft. in order to reduce these risks, this paper proposes the application of blockchain in global nuclear fuel supply chains integration of blockchain into nuclear supply chains can enable the mitigation of these risks by facilitating traceability of materials, allowing timely and precise detection of location of theft and eliminating the contingency of record- tampering through digitization of the nuclear material accounting registry. this paper explores the applicability of blockchains in the nuclear context by: (1) mapping the nuclear fuel supply chain (2) identifying and prioritizing associated risks using fmea and (3) proposing a framework of the blockchain infrastructure needed to reduce the occurrence of the identified risks.","smart supply chains, risk management, blockchain, nuclear materials",,"aamirah mohammed ashraf and walid abdul kader department of mechanical, automotive and materials engineering university of windsor windsor, on n9b 3p4, canada moham13d@uwindsor.ca, kader@uwindsor.ca",
87,Incentivizing Sustainability: Price Optimization For A  Closed-Loop Apparel Supply Chain,"although sustainability in supply chains has been garnering increased attention, there is much room for prescriptive research devoted to operationalizing sustainability in apparel supply chains (ascs). being one of the largest polluters, apparel industry landfills immense amounts of garments most of which could be reconditioned, reused, or recycled into useful raw materials. especially, fast fashion (low-cost clothing designs based on current, high-cost luxury fashion trends) necessitates fast-response supply chains, encouraging disposability, and thereby exacerbating an unsustainable consumption. the importance of sustainability in ascs are emphasized via trends in 3r (reduce, reuse and recycle), recycling facts in north america, and apparel companies that actively engaged in sustainability initiatives. to that end, we study a closed-loop apparel supply chain (clasc) model that include the process of recycling end-of-life garments. when the implications of fast fashion on profitability, environmental and social costs, recycling costs, and incentives offered to consumers are factored in, we study the optimal pricing decision for the clasc and provide a closed-form solution. model analytics, managerial insights along with numerical illustrations are offered.","sustainability, reverse logistics",,"shayla fitzsimmons cioos-atlantic, and centre for research in sustainable supply chain analytics dalhousie university halifax, ns b3h 4r2, canada shayla.fitzsimmons@dal.ca lisa ma rbi, and centre for research in sustainable supply chain analytics dalhousie university halifax, ns b3h 4r2, canada lisa.ma@dal.ca m. ali ülkü rowe school of business, and centre for sustainable supply chain analytics dalhousie university halifax, ns b3h 4r2, canada ulku@dal.ca",

89,Industrial Engineering Students’ Perceptions Of Flipped  Classroom Experience,"one of the most pressing issues in today’s engineering education is whether we need/need-not to change from conventional engineering education and explore more creative and innovative ways to educate engineers to be ready for today’s dynamic and disruptive industry. research indicates that employers are now seeking engineers with soft skills such as critical thinking, problem-solving, lifelong learning, and others in addition to their technical skills. thus, one needs to ask the question, do we equip and prepare our students with the right soft skills, in addition to the technical skills, using conventional engineering education? are there any other educational approach that could help in developing the student soft skills? to address these questions, we studied the implementation of the flipped classroom methodology in two of the upper-division industrial engineering courses. we explored, via a survey, the students’ learning and perspective in two flipped classrooms from the lens of the reported advantages and advantages categories in the literature. the results of the survey indicated that the flipped classroom model improved the students’ critical thinking skills, promote creativity, helped them focus on problem-solving, improved their ict skills, and improved their learning performance. on the other hand, the top disadvantages based on the students’ perspective included the not preferred method, time-consuming, unfair method, and resistance to change.","flipped classroom, engineering, indonesia, 2017","In response to employers’ interest in seeking engineers with soft skills such as critical thinking, problem solving, lifelong learning, and others in addition to their technical skills, we explored the flipped classroom model to assess if it is an effective active learning model to equip and prepare students with the right soft and technical skills. A survey composed of 18 determinants/questions (advantages and disadvantages) affecting the flipped classroom, along with three open-ended questions, was given to a total of 44 third year Industrial Engineering students. The results of the survey indicated that the flipped classroom improved the students’ critical thinking skills, promote creativity, helped them focus on problem-solving, improved their ICT skills, and improved their learning performance. The aggregate percentage of the students’ agreement on the advantages is 47% which was not a high percentage of positive experience of the flipped classroom. On the contrary, the top disadvantages based on the students’ perspective included the not preferred method, time-consuming, unfair method, and resistance to change. The aggregate percentage of the students’ agreement on the disadvantages is 36%. All in all, based on our survey and analysis, there was no conclusive evidence of the preference, or not, of using the flipped classroom model in higher level Industrial Engineering courses. The aggregate percentages of the students’ agreement on the flipped classroom model advantages and disadvantages do not outweigh one side over the other. Therefore, a follow-up study in future semesters should be conducted to verify the results and collect more data, and perhaps employ more in-depth statistical analysis.","ammar aamer faculty of engineering and technology department of industrial engineering sampoerna university jakarta, indonesia ammar.aamer@sampoernauniversity.ac.id nesrine el-zine faculty of arts and humanities sana’a university sana’a yemen nelzineut@gmail.com","references and expectations of engineering

90,A Novel Mathematical Programming Approach For  Aggregate Proportioning: A Case Study For Highway,"durability and serviceability of a highway can be ensured by use of proper quality materials and then, mixing them in right proportion. the present work is a case study on proportioning of aggregate materials for construction of surface course of highways. most of the times, the aggregates available for mixing have particle size grading that, if used, will not meet all of the specifications. in such situations, it becomes very difficult to determine a right proportioning of aggregates that will have the minimum amount of deviation from such specifications. existing methodologies for the proportioning do not ensure the best solution from this viewpoint. to overcome such difficulties, the aggregate proportioning problem has been formulated as a goal-programming model. the approach described in this paper is equally applicable for proportioning of the aggregates for some of the other layers of a highway.",goal-programming,"In a number of civil engineering applications, mixing of particles on the basis of their size gradation has been applied in various major areas like structural engineering for building construction, transportation engineering for making certain layers of flexible pavements, environmental engineering for preparing filtration systems, geotechnical engineering to erect embankments, and in hydraulics and water resources engineering to build earthen dams. In addition to the few applications mentioned above, there are many others involving the use of materials graded on the basis of size characteristics to achieve certain properties like surface-smoothness, durability, porosity, filterability, strength, compaction, drainage etc. In the present paper, a case study regarding aggregate proportioning has been discussed with","construction anil kumar agrawal mechanical engineering department, indian institute of technology (bhu) varanasi – 221 005, india bhu.anil@gmail.com devendra mohan civil engineering department, indian institute of technology (bhu) varanasi – 221 005, india devendra.civ@iitbhu.ac.in",

Lack of fund is also found to scare clients away from opting for sustainable construction, this is very much believed that if green building is incorporated in construction industry contractual procedure, there will be limited chance of professionals in the construction industry executing non-sustainable construction project.. Finally, this research recommended that there should be a platform for awareness to the public about sustainable construction and this should be well grounded by incorporating green building into the standard building code of Nigeria. Sustainability of construction project in Nigeria is a key factor to consider at the design stage of any construction project for both the designer and the regulatory agencies, and these factors are to be monitored throughout the construction process since they are vital in measuring the performance of any sustainable construction project to infer a more desirable and satisfactory sustainable building.","sanmi olowosile department of quantity surveying, federal university of technology akure, nigeria sanmijossy@yahoo.com ayodeji oke and clinton aigbavboa sustainable human settlement and construction research centre, faculty of engineering and the built environment, university of johannesburg, south africa emayok@gmail.com, caigbavboa@uj.ac.za",
101,Drivers To The Adoption Of Automation And Robotics In The  Construction Industry,"the construction world is swiftly moving towards the simplification and computerization of virtually all construction processes. automation and robotics have been singled out by previous studies as a means of achieving this feat. a lot of countries have adopted these ideas to a large extent; however, some other regions are yet to do so. this study therefore seeks to identify and assess the drivers to aid the adoption of automation and robotics in the ondo state construction industry. the review of literature was done briefly to identify some of these factors. survey design was used in the research methodology and design; and questionnaires were administered to built environment professionals (architects, civil engineers, quantity surveyors) based on the number of samples drawn from the overall population of professionals present in ondo state, nigeria. data was collected and using statistical package for social sciences (spss). results showed that the biggest drivers to the adoption of automation and robotics were size of firm, performance increment and familiarity with the concepts of automation and robotics. it was recommended that construction firms should try embracing these concepts as the benefits are potentially limitless.","automation, robotics, construction, ondo state","and Recommendation The future patterns and open doors for the usage of robotization and apply autonomy advances in development ventures can be recorded and positioned from the most least noteworthy, there will be more noteworthy familiarity with mechanization and mechanical technology advances inside the development business network; the quantity of development organizations utilizing computerization and apply autonomy will altogether expand; mechanization and apply autonomy advances will be less expensive to obtain and work; there will be a fundamentally bigger scope of robotization and apply autonomy innovations accessible for use in development; the utilization of computerization and apply autonomy advances will empower firms to work all the more proficiently and intensely; the advances will be effectively accessible everywhere throughout the world; the advances would be promptly acknowledged by the laborers and the business; there would be a more noteworthy joining inside the development business as far as control and duty regarding structure and development. Because of the high multifaceted nature of the development procedure and the development mechanical improvement robotization and apply autonomy selection is essential in other to propel development techniques.

104,A Study On Carbon Footprint  Omoniyi Durojaye  And Timothy Laseinde,"increasing greenhouse gaseous concentration in the atmosphere is perturbing the environment to cause grievous global warming and associated consequences. following the rule that only measurable is manageable, mensuration of greenhouse gas intensiveness of different products, bodies, and processes is going on worldwide, expressed as their carbon footprints. the methodologies for carbon footprint calculations are still evolving and it is emerging as an important tool for greenhouse gas management. the concept of carbon foot printing has permeated and is being commercialized in all the areas of life and economy, but there is little coherence in definitions and calculations of carbon footprints among the studies. there are disagreements in the selection of gases, and the order of emissions to be covered in footprint calculations. standards of greenhouse gas accounting are the common resources keyword: carbon footprint, direct emissions, emissions, greenhouse gases 1. introduction the intergovernmental panel on climate change (ipcc) in its fourth assessment report has strongly recommended to limit the increase in global temperature below 2◦c as compared to preindustrial level (i.e., measured from 1750) to avoid serious ecological and economic threats. based on noaa data, the 2017 average global temperature across land and ocean surface areas was 0.84°c (1.51°f) above the twentieth-century average of 13.9°c (57.0°f), making it the third-warmest year on record behind 2016 (warmest) and 2015 (second warmest)[1]. the imbalances caused in natural systems due to warming are already being signaled in the form of extreme weather events and climate change. the mountainous snow cover, permafrost, and glaciers are melting, and greenland, antarctic, and arctic ice packs are experiencing a negative mass balance causing the sea level to rise at a rate of 3 mm year−1 [2-4]. owing to such complex changes in natural phenomena, it has been projected that 1–2 billion additional people will be under water stress, crop productivity in mid-latitudes will suffer loss, and wildlife and biodiversity will be threatened[2]. on social forefront, developing and poor countries are at immediate and disproportionately high risk of being adversely affected by global warming and thus the “millennium development goal” of eradicating poverty may be compromised[5]. “the world is running short of time and option” at social and economic front in view of high risks related with global warming and climate change[6]. strong and immediate local to international actions are thus needed to stabilize emissions in a justified 1686",,"Carbon footprint has emerged as a strong mode of GHG expression. While earlier studies focused only on CO2 emissions as the guidelines and suggested inclusion of all the important GHGs in calculation, carbon footprint started becoming synonymous to a comprehensive GHG account, over the life cycle stages of any product or activity. No definition, however, has yet been accepted coherently as is clear from the fact that there are different selection of gases and tiers among studies. However, as carbon footprint reports are increasing in response to legal or business requirements, most of the calculations are following the GHG protocol worldwide. Since it has been extended to cover natural system as well, it becomes essential to deal with the unavoidable emissions. Carbon footprint has been commercialized and is being utilized by organizations to count their carbon and adopt measures to cut down emissions. This business sense has taken carbon consciousness to the households through numerous online calculators and has helped in making the civil society aware of how much their activities are contributing to global warming. Ironically, there is no check on such carbon calculating facilities and they lack coherence and transparency. Since carbon footprinting is associated with money transactions and has been found to influence businesses, legal guidelines are necessary to monitor these calculations. Carbon footprinting must be harnessed as a strong tool to promote GHG emission reductions among businesses, events, and civil society and should be included as indicator of sustainable development.","mechanical and industrial engineering tech department, university of johannesburg, rsa dfc campus, south africa. otlaseinde@uj.ac.za, durojayerapheal@gmail.com ifetayo oluwafemi postgraduate school of engineering management, university of johannesburg, rsa south africa ijoluwafemi@uj.ac.za",
105,Job Rotation Model In Manufacturing Systems To Reduce  Ergonomic Risks Due To Work,"doing risky works continuously by an operator can result in harmful effects on the health and performance of operator over time because of ergonomic hazards. in order to reduce these negative effects, it is necessary for the labors to be exposed to such dangers with the same amount. a branch of operation research that analyzes the allocation of staff to different tasks in order to balance the ergonomic risks and complications of doing continuous risky works in planning horizon in known as job rotation. in the present work, we want to simulate the job rotation problem of staff with different skills in cell production systems and show the efficiency of meta-heuristic algorithms to solve this np_hard model. in order to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed solutions, a number of sample problems have been generated randomly and they have been solved by meta-heuristic simulated annealing, and then its results has been compared with accurate methods of optimization in which the comparison of these results shows the high efficiency of proposed meta- heuristic algorithm and the better performance in the quality of results considering time resolution.","job rotation, ergonomic risk","In this paper, a new model to implement a job rotation scheme in cellular manufacturing systems is provided. The model is trying to minimize the damage caused by the staff exposure to workplace ergonomic risks, in this regard staff skills is in high importance and job rotation is possible in particular cell because of the difference between the amount of workload in different cells. The result in this model illustrates that for solving the problems of large size which LINGO software is not able to solve them, or it can solve them in a very long time, simulated annealing algorithm will gain very close results to optimal answers in a short time. It is recommended for future research to study job rotation within and between cells, and at the present time some research is being pursued by the authors of this article. Also, the skill level of employees is assumed to be stable, but for future research it is suggested that staff skills be considered dynamically. Another proposal is taking into account the ergonomic risks so that each employee is not only exposed to the influence of ergonomic risks of machines that he is working on but also the other machines which are involved in the cell.","amirsalar malekahmadi industrial engineering department, isfahan university of technology, isfahan, iran a.malekahmadi@in.iut.ac.ir mohsen soleymani industrial engineering department, islamic azad university of arak, arak, iran msoleimani@iau-arak.ac.ir somaye tianimoghadam chemical department, lorestan university, lorestan, iran s.tiani@yahoo.com",

108,Incentive Contracts In Project Management Under  Contractor'S Process Improvement,"around 55% of businesses experience project failure at some point where the failure is usually blamed on culprits such as a bad idea, poor planning, overly aggressive timelines, or unforeseen changes and delays. this is mainly because of working in an uncertain environment, which leads to suboptimal results, where each side of a transaction tries to get a premium for the risk to which it is exposed. from a project management perspective, the contractor may exert less effort and may ask for higher reimbursement. this leads to less efficient economic performance and consequently less economic benefits to the project owner. in order to reduce future uncertainty, the project manager should offer a proper contract. for example, to reduce price uncertainty, the project manager and contractor may sign a fixed-price contract, whereas, when the product has to be developed, such as in r&d projects, and where there is uncertainty on the production side, the contractor faces additional uncertainty, hence the project manager may have to offer a cost plus incentive fee contract. this paper aims to develop an effective contractual strategy to help the project manager increase its control and visibility over contractor's process. specifically, we aim to answer the following research questions: 1. what are the main inefficiencies that the project manager faces with a contractor whose cost and the level of of process improvement are privately known by the contractor? 2. what are the characteristics of an effective contractual strategy for the project manager to induce the optimal level of process improvement on its contractors? to address the above research questions, we develop an incentive contract for the project manager when outsourcing to a risky contractor whose delivery outcome is subject to quality risk. to reduce the likelihood of failure, the contractor can invest in a costly process improvement effort, however, the cost of such an effort is private information for the contractor, which results in adverse selection problem. moreover, the contractor's decision on process improvement is also unobservable to the project manager, which results in moral hazard problem. we first obtain the first-best solution, and then solve for the second-best optimal cost plus incentive fee (cpif) contract under full information asymmetry. our comparative study between the first- and second-best contracts enables us to characterize the efficiency loss due to underinvestment by the high-cost contractor and information rent extracted by the low-cost contractor.","project management, contract design, ryerson university",,"mahsa madani hosseini ted rogers school of management ryerson university 55 dundas st w, toronto, on m5g 2c3, canada mahsa.madani@ryerson.ca",

The designed WSN system is compatible with other sensor nodes. These sensor nodes are able to monitor farm environmental parameters such as soil moisture, humidity, air temperature, and light intensity. Its compatibility with other sensor nodes allows more sensors to be conveniently attached to it and to control the irrigation system through its output port. A communication link between the farmer and the farm system was established by employing the GSM communication technology, where the farmer can request for information about the farm and the farm system can notify the farmer about the farm development. Future research efforts will focus on reducing the size and cost of the sensor nodes. Surface mounted components can be used instead of the through hole components used for making the sensor node. This will significantly reduce the size. In addition, a low-cost wireless transceiver e.g. the CC300, nRF24L01 module, can be used instead of the XBee module used in this work. This will reduce the cost and size of the sensor nodes. Mass production of the sensor nodes will also reduce the SNs.","1,2department of quality and operations management, university of johannesburg, rsa dfc campus, south africa. 3postgraduate school of engineering management, university of johannesburg, rsa jesusetemiayeni@yahoo.com, pule.kholopane@gmail.com, ijoluwafemi@uj.ac.za esther t. akinlabi department of mechanical engineering science, university of johannesburg, rsa apk campus, 2006, south africa. etakinlabi@uj.ac.za",
116,On Minimum Cost Non-Uniform Sampling Schemes For  Optimal Design Of Control Charts: Application To 𝑿̅ And 𝑻𝟐,"as an economically superior approach to uniform sampling scheme, the pioneering work of rahim and banerjee on sampling procedure with non-uniform intervals has been broadly employed in statistical process monitoring during the past three decades. however, since its consecutive times of inspection have to be determined through a function of the first sampling interval, it might make some kind of complexity in practical administration compare to uniform approach. in this paper, the intuitive companionship between the sampling frequencies and the failure rate of a process is discussed by investigating various functional constraints on choosing the length of sampling intervals and their effects on the optimal design of control charts, specifically for processes which deteriorate over time. extensive numerical illustrations are prepared for monitoring univariate and multivariate quality characteristics in manufacturing and service sectors following an increasing failure rate weibull shock model. the results obtained from proposed structures for sampling intervals could slightly improve the expected cost per unit time which illustrate rahim- banerjee model inducing constant integrated hazard over each sampling interval is a well-established near-optimal non-uniform approach. however, further investigation on the mathematical problem of finding the sampling scheme by which the cost function is optimized would be highly fruitful.",,"As a process deteriorates over time, the reasonable approach for sampling over time is to decrease the time intervals. Various decreasing inspection scheme are applied in this paper for IFR processes with Wiebull distribution and the optimal design outputs of their corresponding economic design are compared to the non-uniform sampling scheme with constant integrated hazard and to the uniform sampling scheme. All the proposed procedures, like the constant integrated hazard, simplify the optimization problem by inducing a function in which the 𝑗th sampling interval is computed through a function of the first interval ℎ1 and 𝑗. In some cases, the proposed procedures are slightly better than the constant integrated hazard approach. Further investigation on the mathematical modelling is needed to find the best non-uniform sampling scheme in the space of all sampling strategies such that the cost model is minimized.

118,Evaluation Assessment Of Warehouse Performance In  Manufacturing Industries,"the research conducted in this study aims to increase warehouse order picking performance by sequence optimization, as travel time covers most picking processes in storages, it is important to have a suitable order of picking lines in a batch to achieve high efficiency. they argued in their study that routing inquiry for line series in selecting order batches in warehouse management systems (wms) is well investigated, recorded and implemented. in addition, they stated that storage areas could be an alternative in practice where routing heuristics could hardly be applied. the line sequence optimization (lso) calculates the line sequence with the minimum travel time for a given batch based on a digitized network. the quantitative evaluation showed an overall improvement potential of 7.4% for a case study at a distributor in the business segment of electronic devices. however, contrary to the systematic routing enquiry, the sequences generated by the lso may seem illogical to the picker a qualitative evaluation must follow to identify sequence patterns and discuss the methodology with the picking staff. although a number of studies have been conducted over the past two decades to address these issues in the current literature review, the purpose of this paper is therefore to evaluate warehouse performance in the manufacturing industry theoretically. the results of the current literature's critical analysis clearly show that there are warehouse performance-related flaws in the current body language.","warehousing, optimization","The objective of this research is to improve the performance of warehouse sequence selecting by sequence optimisation, because travel time includes most selecting procedures in storage areas, an appropriate order of select lines in a batch is essential to attain high effectiveness.

119,Zack Algorithm: A Heuristic Approach To Solve  Transportation Problem,"the problem of distribution is a classic problem in logistics. the transportation method is a method that is widely used in overcoming these problems. the optimization method is sometimes difficult if directly applied to minimize transportation costs so that the initial solution that is heuristic in nature is needed first even more so if there are many variables. a good initial solution is one that is easily done quickly and approaches the optimal solution. this research offers a new method of finding an initial solution called zack algorithm which only has 5 steps that are easy to do. based on the case study carried out, zack algorithm produces the lowest cost which is 0.28% lower than the north west corner method and 0.15% lower than the least cost method.","logistics, transportation, heuristic, least cost","Zack Algorithm is a new method in solving initial solutions to transportation problems. The basic principle is to fill in the number 0 in the cell that has the highest cost and fills the maximum amount in the cell that has the lowest cost. In the case study described above, it is known that the Zack Algorithm is better than the NWC and LC methods because it produces the lowest total cost where the total cost of the Zack Algorithm is 0.28% lower than the NWC method and 0.15% compared to the LC method.

125,Impact Of High Speed Railways In Regional Economy:  A Regression Analysis,"transportation is an important contributor to economic growth and development of a country as it facilitates easy movement of goods and resources. one of the indicators of a country’s economic development is gdp. in this paper, we discuss the rapid penetration of high speed railways (hsr) in china within a short span of two decades and its impact on the local economy. for our research, we chose the wuhan guangzhou line that began operations in 2011. we compute the theoretical regional gross development product (rgdp) of six cities that are along this line and three cities which are not connected by any hsr lines by using regression analysis. independent variables in our study are population, employment, capex investment in land assets, length of highways and higher education strength. dependent variable is the rgdp and we used data from 2006 to 2019. we benchmarked the change in theoretical rgdp over the years with the actual rgdp. our results indicate that cities along the hsr line have an increase in their rgdp, whereas cities that are not along the hsr line have a decrease in rgdp. we infer that a hsr (or a transport infrastructure) that facilitates ease movement of goods and services has a positive impact on the region’s growth; however, this could also adversely impact the neighbourhood that are not directly connected by the hsr. we would like to possibly extend our model to analyse the regional growth of european countries and the influence of hsr on it. we believe that it will be an interesting contribution, as our model benchmarks within-the country growth in china, whereas it would be across the countries in europe. biography professor sundaravalli narayanaswami is the chairperson, public systems group, iim ahmedabad. she earned her phd in industrial engineering and operations research from iit bombay, after a masters in computer science.at iim ahmedabad, she holds a primary affiliation with the public systems and group and a secondary affiliation with production and quantitative methods area. her teaching interests are in transportation studies (urban, intelligent systems, heavy and light rails, transport infrastructure), operations research in public systems, operations management, artificial intelligence and government systems and policies. most of her research in the past and present are in transportation operations and knowledge management that involve applications of ict and or tools in real-life problems of large impact. dr sundaravalli started her career in it services marketing and she soon moved to a production profile in an electronics equipment manufacturing industry. her academic career began later and she has taught at various programs in mumbai university and at institutes under the uae federal education ministry in abu dhabi and dubai. she has also taught in many executive development programs while at uae. she has authored two research based books on transportation systems and they are published by reputed international publishers. she also publishes and reviews regularly for scholarly editorials and presents her research findings among peers, both in india and abroad. dr. sundaravalli holds several professional affiliations. she was awarded the fellow of the british computer society in 2008. while in abu dhabi, she had served as the youth professional group representative of the entire middle east region for the british computer society. she is the honoured recipient of the distinguished educator award for the year 2018 from the international society of industrial engineering and operations management (ieom), received in johannesburg, south africa. 1767",,,"dr. sundaravalli narayanaswami chairperson, public systems group indian institute of management ahmedabad (iim ahmedabad), india",

130,Production Systems Design:   Time Series Approach To Forecasting,"in any industry, it is imperative to maintain a clear perspective on trends for potential purchasing demand. with insight into how demand will fluctuate, decisions can be made to ensure the proper supply of goods or services will be available to meet customers’ needs. as to the definition of forecasting, its primary function is to predict the future values. forecasting provides an estimate of future demand, with the primary consistent goal being to minimize forecasting error. better forecasts result in lower inventories, reduced stock-outs, smoother production plans, reduced costs, and improved customer service. there are two separate approaches to forecasting. the forecasting techniques consist of qualitative and quantitative forecasting. qualitative forecasts are generally based off soft skills such as impressions or intuition. these factors are difficult or almost impossible to quantify. this method is used when data is limited, unavailable, or not currently relevant. this method may also be used when no demand history exists for a particular product or service. as such, the forecast’s outcome will heavily depend on the skill and experience of the forecaster and available impressionable information. qualitative forecasts use subjective inputs such as opinions for consumer surveys, experts, and historical impressions. in this case, a panel of experts may assemble to collect idea then move forward with a forecast outline. scenario writing may be used to develop a conceptual scenario of future trends based on a well-defined set of assumptions. qualitative methods often include brainstorming sessions to assemble a baseline idea platform to move forward with. quantitative forecasting approaches on the contrary are based on analysis of historical data of one or more time series. mathematical models are used to calculate potential demand fluctuation. the various methods of calculation are varied based on desired outcome information and available initial information available. available quantitative forecasting methods consist of the following methods: time series analysis, linear regression, simple moving average, weighted moving averages, exponential smoothing and exponential smoothing with trends. these models while all unique in their own way have their pros and cons which will explored extensively in the poster presentation.",linear regression,,"demetri blackwood, tanashki frater, navardo henry and chelsea wright department of industrial engineering kettering university flint, mi 48504, usa blac3204@kettering.edu , frat1624@kettering.edu , henr1629@kettering.ed , wrig6064@kettering.edu",

133,"An Overview Of Design Considerations For 3-Wheel Vehicle  Safety Improvement, Considering Supplementary Restraint","supplemental restraint systems (srs) are safety devices built into contemporary vehicles, to reduce the direct impact vehicle interior parts have on drivers and passengers in the event of sudden collision. the need for safety features in 3-wheel vehicles is imperative due to increasing use of unconventional vehicles for both passenger transport and e-commerce last mile logistics. the paper reviews technological advancements in srs with focus on their features in terms of innovation and applicability. this informed the design considerations for a suitable srs system for unconventional vehicles. the paper shares historical background and significant changes that have occurred from the initial models installed in motor vehicles, to emerging technologies which are currently being installed in 2 and 4-wheel vehicles. it further researched innovative devices that complement airbags for improved vehicle safety. the study involved a logical review of literature to gain insight into the historical background of airbags and considerations from design perspective. the findings set pace to track evolution in airbags using an exploratory study approach. the study findings have created a benchmark for airbag installation in 3-wheeled vehicles.","srs, vehicle safety, airbag","Significant advances in automotive SRS industry from inception to date have been explored. The findings reveal major changes experienced in the airbag industry, from inception till date. The automotive industry attributes most of its safety innovations and vehicle improvement to the invention of the airbag. As a supplemental protection device, the airbag has been extensively researched and ongoing studies across the globe are mainly towards improving its overall performance and exploring its life saving potential. From the Federal motor vehicle safety standards data in Table 1, the 2 473 saved from the year 2012 alone out of a total of 12 074 lives saved within the survey period amounts to 20.5% of lives saved. Many of the improvements in airbags were witnessed after the late 90s and this partly suggest the reason for this achievement. Table 2 equally shows the complementary benefit, airbags contributed to the overall statistics of lives saved based on the fatality analysis report. The index shows that between the year 2008–2012, 11 682 lives were saved which was achieved within a 5 year period compared to the 12 074 lives saved from 1960–2002 (42 year period). We can deduce from the figures that airbags have progressively and consistently supplemented the seat belt and other vehicle safety devices. Research is ongoing on the use of external airbags as presented in Figure 7 which promises to be the next breakthrough in reducing impact between colliding vehicles and vehicle-pedestrian collision (VPC). The sensitivity of the SRS control sensors has also witnessed tremendous improvements within the last 20 years. From the research, it was discovered that some commercial public passenger vehicles have not been given much priority in terms of airbag installation. A major source of intercity transportation system within Africa, Asia and part of the middle east is the tricycle; indeed the safety of this daily commuting transportation system should be explored because very little research work has been presented in this area. Scientists in Africa need to increase their involvement in vehicle safety research, based on the fact that most of the commercial tricycles and commercial buses with limited safety features are domiciled within the continent and all the airbag patents identified thus far, originate from Europe, Asia, Australia and America . The fatalities and injuries experienced by poorly detonated airbags have been on the decline and this will further reduce as more innovations are evolving in the airbag industry. ‘In the upcoming years, innovations in smart airbag systems will be focused on special intelligent features, such as, automatic radioing for assistance and information about the location, severity and number of occupants involved in the crash, pre-tensioning the seat belts, switching off the fuel pump and other appropriate systems, among others. Future growth in the market will also be driven by continued investments in technology development and R&D as manufacturers seek newer air bag applications areas to offset the stabilizing opportunities in the mature front impact airbags sector’ (Global-Industry-Analysts, 2012).

This paper presented a successful case study of minimizing the number of delayed jobs which was considered as defects in a service contracting company by conducting a Six Sigma project and the DMAIC problem-solving methodology. After the analyses carried out in the project phases, it was found that the mode of receiving jobs order and analyzing the job requirements had a statistically significant impact on the NODJ. Taking this into consideration, an optimum combination of using an online approach and database system were determined to receive and analyze the jobs order and its requirements. Although the improvement has not reached to the sigma level of six, the implementation of Six Sigma methodology has achieved its purpose and considerable improvement has been obtained in the service quality. The percentage of NODJ decreases from 14.3% to 5.3% and the sigma level increased from 2.57up to 3.12. Therefore, this study can be considered as a pilot project that demonstrates that the applications of Six Sigma are effective approaches capable of improving the service quality in non-manufacturing sectors as long as the organization continues embracing Six Sigma within its continuous improvement culture.","salem lakrash, ahad ali and duane shortt a. leon linton department of mechanical engineering lawrence technological university southfield, mi 48075, usa slakrash@ltu.edu, aali@ltu.edu, dshortt@ltu.edu",

137,Application Of Lean Manufacturing For Improving The  Process At Blue Sky Machining Corp.,"lean manufacturing is a systematic approach towards identifying the values in relation to the customer, exposing the waste with a sole aim to reduce the amount of waste and the non-value added activities. lean manufacturing is indeed a very powerful approach which seeks continuous improvement in quality and reducing the waste. a process improvement methodology can become much better if both the approaches i.e. lean manufacturing and six sigma take into consideration these approaches streamline operations, increases values and reduce waste. in this paper we have described the case study done at blue sky machining corp. with the application of various lean tools in order to maximize the production, reducing the throughput loss, and realizing the potential causes that can result in the loss of customers. we have significantly focused on achieving the standard operation time at each level of production.","ishikawa diagram, 5why, fmea","and Result With the application of various lean tools we analyzed the whole process and steps involved in the manufacturing and here we are proposing the final solution to the problems: 1. The inventory accumulation can be eliminated by improving the cycle time of roll form and press machine operation from 11sec to 9sec, 22sec to 18sec respectively. 2. The ideal cycle time at roll form is achieved by introducing an Omron ZW-8000 / 7000 / 5000 Series sensors. [10]These sensors are high precision sensor and can easily work on a reflecting surface. And hence we can get rid of the variation in length of the product which would eventually save our time on rework. 3. The application of MODAPTS helped us in mapping the excessive movement that was been performed by the operator. On restricting the motion of operator on pressing machine has helped us to achieve the ideal cycle time i.e. 18sec. 4. Finally we started a new weld cell (already present in the plant) for 3 hours in a 8 hours shift and restricting the roll form operation for 5 hours and enabling that one operator to work in the new weld cell for 3 hours creating a multi skill environment hence can increase the overall efficiency of the cycle 5. The current state VSM cycle efficiency comes out to be 0.047% and the future state VSM cycle efficiency comes out to be 0.0509%.","anvesh rajak, maganjot singh dhami department of mechanical and industrial engineering university of windsor, windsor, canada rajak@uwindsor.ca",

145,Towards Optimization By Matching Of Response Surfaces:  Finding Windows Of Maximal Similarity,"the ultimate goal of this work is to find a region where the response surface of a function that is not well characterized in terms of optimality resembles one that is well-characterized in such terms to find, at least, a local optimum. the region in the input space where this resemblance occurs, we call a window of maximum similarity (wms) and is identified by formulating and solving an optimization problem. the method is one of minimization of squared errors and can be used to explore experimental or simulated data. a series of examples are presented to show the method’s feasibility and capability for generating a two- dimensional wms. this method is a viable element that will serve for the future development of optimization by similarity.","optimization, simulation, metamodels","and Future Work This work proposed the use of WMS for future optimization by similarity. The method intends to find the experimental region where a model with desirable characteristics is a good descriptor of the data at hand. An evaluation case using function AOG 1 was presented. According to these results, the method demonstrates the potential to find regions of similarity between two responses where optimality can be a pattern of interest. The evaluations of the method in seven unconstrained global optimization test functions served to show the use of window of maximum similarity in examples of functions with different shapes. Also, it was observed in the evaluations that the WMS method potentially detected zones of maximum similarity between the different test functions and a quadratic function. According to these results, the method demonstrates the potential to find regions of similarity between two responses where optimality can be a pattern of interest and can be a useful tool for exploration of simulated data to find, at least a local optimum. In many cases, the WMS obtained by the method were limited to take the minimum size or epsilon value assigned, which is why future work includes: 1. Substitute Optimization of one composite objective function to multiple criterion optimization, as presented in Rodríguez-Yáñez, Méndez-Vázquez, and Cabrera-Ríos, M., 2014. 2. Include more variables to the test functions to evaluate. 3. Experiment using alternative metamodels. 4.

154,Neural Network And Internet Of Things Implementation To  Aid Pedestrian Safety,"increasing pedestrian safety is currently an issue that most countries are facing as pedestrian security is of prime concern. this paper aims to propose a technique that utilizes the camera data collected for each street by montreal’s government. the collected data is used to train a neural network using simulation and tensorflow, which then identifies pedestrian patterns that are observed during each time of the day. these patterns can then aid in enhancing pedestrian security measures in the chosen streets. the neural network is trained to identify the number of pedestrians in the streets, peak hours at which pedestrian density is maximum, streets which have most pedestrian density throughout the day, and various other patterns described in this work. this data is then used to control the pedestrian and traffic lights, issue warnings onto the pedestrians’ smartphones in the vicinity of the risk area etc. this task is achieved by utilizing internet of things (iot), cloud services, and micro-controllers installed near street lights on streets. thus, this work not only promotes pedestrian safety but also acts as an aid to developing smart cities. this work makes use of the image data freely provided by the city of montreal. it also discusses the advantages, weaknesses, limitations, and future scope of the above-mentioned proposed technique.","internet of things, pedestrian safety, cloud services","This work presents an efficient solution that can aid in enhancing pedestrian safety in a cost effective, and reliable way. The issue of pedestrian safety is of utmost importance as the traditional systems for pedestrian safety pose many limitations and disadvantages that render them relatively ineffective. The technique proposed in this paper aims to eliminate those limitations and provide a reliable and extremely efficient system. This camera data collected for each street by Montreal’s government is used to train a neural network using simulation and Tensorflow, which then identifies pedestrian patterns that are observed during each time of the day. The neural network is trained to identify the number of pedestrians in the streets, peak hours at which pedestrian density is maximum, streets which have most pedestrian density throughout the day, and various other patterns. This data can then control the Pedestrian and traffic lights, issue warnings onto the pedestrians’ smartphones in the vicinity of the risk area etc. This proposed solution has been compared and contrasted with several other solutions that currently exist. Its efficiency, reliability, and cost-effectiveness make it a better alternative than most other works. Moreover, this technique can also provide information and alerts to emergency services and other higher authorities. This not only makes it ideal for pedestrian safety, but also aids in developing Smart Cities.","ujjwal khanna, anjali awasthi concordia university concordia institute for information systems engineering (ciise) montreal, qc ujjwalkhanna7@gmail.com, anjali.awasthi@concordia.ca",
155,Utilizing The Blockchain Technology As An Effective Means  For Supply Chain Traceability.,"given the broad range of activities carried out in the supply chain, product traceability stands out as the core of any successful supply chain management program. traceability therefore is the planning and execution of activities which allow a person or an entity to monitor the pathway of a product from its origin down to the consummation of the product. this helps a company or an organization to be in control of all of the processes involved in a product’s lifecycle, it also increases transparency during the manufacturing phase of a product and thereby enhancing consumer trust. though traceability is critical in achieving success in any supply chain transaction. however, the effectiveness of this effort relies on the method by which it is carried out. in the past, and even up till now, various means have been utilized in carrying out the traceability activities in the supply chain, such as the use of rfid in product labelling and identification and manual register for recording transaction levels. nonetheless, due to the diverse nature of the supply chain industry which cuts across various industries, these methods have not been wholly sufficient in achieving product traceability, and this has led to multiple product losses and recalls. in this paper, we propose the use of blockchain as a means of improving the efficiency of traceability activities in the supply chain industry. by initiating the use of digital smart contracts in the blockchain as a technique to automate and track the path of a product within the supply chain, we are able to track the state of every transaction and produce an audit trail of the trace path of any product in a supply chain transaction. the result of this implementation is the elimination of certain human errors which occur during the creation of traceability logs and an optimized cost function of traceability in the supply chain industry. furthermore, we compared the time-length of writing a traceability transaction log, in a supply chain and error rate of transactions between blockchain, rfid and manual register, by using a waiting line simulation technique in ms excel as basis for the choice of a tech solution in any traceability effort, the result of this comparison is that the blockchain technology has a much lower time to complete a transaction trace log with an optimized error rate of 0.000001% and therefore we conclude the choice of blockchain is preferred as a technology solution to supply chain traceability.","supply chain, blockchain, traceability, technology","5.1 As can be seen the supply chain traceability is essential for maintaining a sustainable supply chain system. The practice of tracing every element used in supply chain has some challenges due to the convoluted nature of the blockchain. Therefore, to mitigate these challenges various solutions have been created. Presently one of the most efficient method of solving these challenges is the blockchain technology. The blockchain technology helps to obviate these difficulties because it is composed of digital execution, operates on decentralized server and scales indefinitely. By using these features of blockchain we can bring visibility to most aspect of the supply chain and help to make the supply chain system more efficient.

157,Using Gis And Neural Network To Evaluate And Predict  Student Success In,"college enrollment and academic preparation across the u.s. is still a challenge, with fewer but more diverse high school graduates each year which results in fewer engineering graduates. one approach to address these challenges is to explore trends in student enrollment and their success in engineering to identify typical student profiles. in the preliminary analysis, college access is explored by examining the demographics of the admitted college of engineering students in one year of study utilizing engineering undergraduate data and us census databases. where the data were visualized graphically using geographic information system (gis) and the preliminary findings suggest that student zip codes can help visualize the factors affecting college access at the institution under study. the maps indicated a significant difference in the student demographics as represented by zip codes and gave a clear indication of which factors should be investigated further. the preliminary research helped us to identify the concentration of students in a particular zip code, form clusters, develop relationship between factors and anticipate their effect on college access. it encouraged us to further our investigation and analyze different factors which may affect the students’ success in colleges of engineering across the country. thus, it drove us into the design, development, training, and testing of feed forward neural network with backpropagation for foreseeing student’s success in terms of graduation results. success will be defined based on the final gpa of a student in graduation. the network will be trained based on the dataset of recent graduates from university and will be tested to predict future outcomes. the network's structure will be optimized, and the predictive capability of the model will be tested. this work can encourage partnerships that can drive institutional initiatives, k-12 educational policy, research and curricular changes that lead to greater support and success for engineering students. now, the results from future work will give us an algorithm that will foresee the student’s success in graduation.","engineering, higher education, gis",,"undergraduate engineering program aishwary pawar university of michigan dearborn dearborn, mi 48128, usa pawara@umich.edu dr. delean tolbert university of michigan dearborn dearborn, mi 48128, usa dtolbert@umich.edu",

159,Design Of An Autonomous Electric Vehicle For Assistance In  The Movement Of People With Visual Disabilities Using Vision,"currently autonomous vehicles are equipped with a variety of sensors, controls and actuators, depending on the objectives and requirements of the vehicle. one of the biggest challenges in the development of the autonomous vehicle system for the assistance in the movement of people with visual disabilities is the high cost. therefore, researchers with a limited budget carry out their experiments and research in simulation environments, while other researchers use small vehicles that in many cases do not accurately represent a real parametric dynamic system. this article describes the design of a low-cost prototype of an autonomous electric vehicle that includes its control systems, microcontrollers, encoders, motor controllers, sensors and cameras. therefore, the designed vehicle has the ability to move autonomously through the use of vision and artificial intelligence algorithms to assist in the movement of the visually impaired person. the document details the first steps of the design taking into account the parameters of a real environment and artificial intelligence algorithms.","(12 font) design, autonomous vehicle","It is concluded that simulations can represent an almost real environment with obstacles. And also neural networks and computer vision can predict and solve a real road driving problem. It can be concluded that the mechanical and electrical design takes into account the requirements of a full-size vehicle, which demonstrates that using mathematical formulas and deformation simulations we can predict and approximate almost exact behavior in a real environment. Finally, the interaction between mechanical design and electrical design has allowed us to explore the capabilities acquired to find the most appropriate solution taking into account time, price and manufacturing.

160,Using Of Optimal Simulation Modelling To Reduce  Radiotherapy Cancer Waiting Time And Improve Survival,"standard indicators of the quality of cancer radiotherapy treatment not only includes accuracy of treatment process, but also the patient wait time to go under treatment. a common cause of anxiety for patients who are diagnosed with cancer and prescribed for radiation therapy is how long they should wait for their radiation sessions to begin. this waiting time estimation either remains unclear or is longer than it is originally planned. one of the major attempts for radiotherapy cancer centers to improve their quality of services is to try to keep the patient waiting time under control and as low as reasonably possible. in this paper, the aim is to understand the magnitude of bottlenecking in the fundamental steps of the radiation therapy treatment process in order to simulate a model that can be used further on by cancer centers to develop their quality program. the result of this optimal simulation model would be a reduction of the delay between the time that the oncology recommends a patient for undergoing radiotherapy and the time that patients actually starts the radiation treatment sessions.",patient wait time,,"malakeh saberi, anjali awasthi concordia institute for information systems engineering (ciise) concordia university 1455 de maisonneuve blvd. west, ev 7.640, montreal, qc m_aberi@encs.concordia.ca, anjali.awasthi@concordia.ca","References

161,Manufacturing And Characterization Of Carbon Fiber And  Carbon Nanotube Hybrid Composites,"carbon fiber reinforced polymer is vastly used within many industries due to its superior specific strength and stiffness. a material that is being developed to be used in conjunction with or as a replacement of carbon fiber is carbon nanotubes (cnts). cnts are a multifunctional material which exhibit excellent mechanical, thermal, and electrical conductive properties. however, these properties are exemplified at the nanoscale level, and the properties begin to decrease as the cnt network increases in scale. the goal is to minimize surface cracks that may occur. therefore, these two materials are tested together and separately to evaluate their performance and validate improvement. functionalization techniques were employed on the cnt network as well as varying the curing parameters to improve the properties. mechanical testing as well as microscopy characterization were performed on the resulting composite samples. results were then analyzed by using statistical tools. after thorough research it was found that, by creating a hybrid composite of carbon nanotubes and carbon fiber, the mechanical properties varied from an improvement upon the control composite to a decrease in properties depending on the test performed. the goal of using this approach is to later be used in larger samples and ultimately in spacecraft and other applications.","carbon fiber, carbon nanotubes, mechanical testing",,"samantha bell, claire jolowsky, ayou hao, and richard liang department of industrial & manufacturing engineering florida a&m university – florida state university college of engineering tallahassee, fl 32310, usa snb15e@my.fsu.edu, cj16d@my.fsu.edu, ahao@eng.famu.fsu.edu, liang@eng.famu.fsu.edu",
162,Review Of Optical Properties Of Two-Dimensional Transition  Metal Dichalcogenides,"two dimensional (2d) materials have become a growing subject in the last 15 years mainly due to the success of graphene, which created a completely different class of material based on its unique, single- layer design. since then, various stable materials of few atoms thick are showing promising capabilities in optical electronics and photonics. one group of material is monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (tmds) which are of the type mx2, where m is a transition metal (such as mo, w, and cr) and is sandwiched between two x atoms, which are chalcogen atoms (such as s, se, or te). tmds can show band gap transformation from the reduction of bulk material to monolayers in a 2d plane. the behavior of such materials at the two-dimensional level has created interest in studying optical capabilities for 2d semiconductors. these materials are showing light interaction over a broad bandwidth from far infrared (fir) to ultraviolet (uv) wavelengths. the materials allow for photodetection in this bandwidth without the need for cooling, creating new potential for optoelectronics. here, we review these tmds and their interaction with light for different applications. 1762",,,"andrew voshella, mukti m rana department of physics and engineering optical science center for applied research delaware state university, dover, de 19901",

166,Better Understanding The Impacts Of Regulatory  Environmental Policies On Inventory And Fleet Replacement,"freight transport is a recognized generator of disproportionate negative externalities: pollutant and greenhouse gas emissions, traffic congestion, noise, road safety issues, and others. the massive emissions due to transportation are especially problematic; studies alert that continuing with the current behavior will increase emissions by approximately 30% compared to 1990 levels in the next thirty years, generating significant consequences for the climate and the lives at least in u.s. (u.s. department of energy & office of scientific and technical information, 2013). according to the world’s leading scientists, we must radically shift our carbon-based economy by 2030 (united nations, 2015). the world must reduce emissions by 45% by 2030 and reach net zero emissions by 2050 to stop warming at 1.5c. otherwise, conditions will significantly worsen on earth for a significant part of the population. to mitigate these impacts, transportation and environmental agencies in the u.s. have developed several guidelines, plans, and regulations. these include fuel taxes to discourage combustion engine vehicles, strict fuel efficiency standards, financial incentives to replace old truck fleets, and others measures. more recently, states in the u.s. have released plans to encourage the use of zero and near-zero emission vehicles. if effective, these initiatives will generate much needed benefits for sustainability. however, considering the cost and technical features of this vehicles the immediate impacts to businesses and fleets are not necessarily understood. to fill this gap, this research aims to evaluate the direct economic impacts of environmental policies on logistics practices (i.e., inventory replenishment and fleet purchase decisions). the study considers two policies seeking to improve the environmental efficiency of transport operations. the first limits the amount of transportation operation emissions, while the second demand a fleet mix to include zero and near-zero emission vehicles. to analyze these policies, the researchers propose the use of an extension of the joint replenishment problem (jrp). this extension deals with two objectives; minimizing cost and minimizing emissions due to transport operation when replenishing inventory, while faces a stochastic demand and limited capacities. to solve the mathematical problem the authors propose a multi- step heuristic based on evolutionary and greedy search algorithms. from the companies’ perspective, this model is a useful tool to determine both inventory policies and fleet composition in a cost-efficient way when the level of emissions produced by vehicles is limited by regulatory policies. on the other hand, from the transportation planner’s perspective, this model allows to determinate more accurate the financial need of the companies when facing regulatory policies, then the planners could design more adequate programs to support the replacement of internal combustion vehicles. preliminary results evidence the trade-off between capital investments in zero-emission vehicles and logistics costs to abide by the potential requirements. the output of empirical cases shows that the ratio cost/emission reduction is not linear, meaning that investing a large amount of money in fleet replacement does not necessarily reduce effectively 1305",,,"carlos otero-palencia1,2 and miguel jaller1 civil and environmental engineering department university of california davis 1 shields ave, davis, ca 95616, u.s.a. departamento de ingeniería industrial universidad del norte km 5, via puerto, barranquilla- colombia cotero@ucadavis.edu, mjaller@ucdavis.edu",

Conclusion Relationship Activity Based Management Change Order (ABMCO) with Efficiency Based on the results of the study, it is noted that Activity Based Management Change Order (ABMCO) has a significant effect on efficiency. This can be seen from the t-statistic value of 2,802 which means greater than 1.96, which means that the more strategic use of Activity Based Management Change Order (ABMCO) will be able to improve project efficiency. In other words, Activity Based Management Change Order (ABMCO) operationally can improve operating efficiency and asset usage rate and lower cost. The focus is to do things right and do more activity. The significant effect of Activity Based Management Change Order (ABMCO) on efficiency shows that efficiency improvement can be made with good Activity Based Management Change Order (ABMCO) implementation. With Activity Based Management Change Order (ABMCO), a company can evaluate the cost and value of a processing activity so that there will be improved competitive position and increased process efficiency. Relationship Economic Value Added (EVA) with Efficiency, Based on the results of the study, it is noted that Economic Value Added (EVA) has a significant effect on efficiency. The significant effect of Economic Value Added (EVA) on efficiency shows that efficiency improvement can be made with good EVA. The result of the analysis indicates that the variable of Economic Value Added (EVA) has a positive influence on project efficiency. This means that project efficiency can be established through good Economic Value Added (EVA). Based on the description above, it can be concluded that the first hypothesis reads ""Economic Value Added (EVA) effect on the efficiency of building construction projects"" otherwise accepted. Relationship Activity Based Management Change Order (ABMCO) with Project Performance, Based on the results of the study, it is noted that ABMCO has no significant effect on project performance.

(2) preservation of subak depends on the presence of water, because water is a material object that is managed by subak. without water, the water control system does not exist, and without subak the system of rice fields in bali as the rice will not be able to run optimally. (3) the longer the presence of water and declining water resources. (4) there is competition in water use between the domestic sector, tourism, animal husbandry, and agriculture it self.","concerving, water irrigation, degradation","The conclusions of this study are as follows. There are several reasons why farmers Subak Gunungsari and Subak Wangaya Betan, to preserve water resources, among others, (1) water is an important factor in rice cultivation, (2) the preservation of water control system depends on the presence of water, because water is a material object managed by subak, (3) the longer the presence of water and declining water resources, (4) there is competition in the use of water between the domestic sector, tourism, livestock, and agriculture itself.","university of hindu indonesia, denpasar, bali, indonesia dewi.yuliana1966@yahoo.co.id ahad ali a. leon linton department of mechanical engineering, lawrence technological university southfield, mi 48075, usa aali@ltu.edu",
169,"Sustaining Traditional Irrigation System Through  Ecotourism Development: Case Of Subak Of Sembung,","subak constitutes a traditional irrigation system in bali which has a nature of socio-agrarian-religious based on the culture and hindu religion in bali. farming culture in the subak system is one of the cultures supporting the development of cultural tourism in bali. since 2012, unesco has recognized the existence of subak as the world cultural heritage. the economic growth of development often results in impacts that are less favorable for agricultural development, such as conversion of rice fields. the government of denpasar city has introduced ecotourism within subak. the objectives of this study are to: (i) find out the problems encountered by subak related to ecotourism; and (ii) describe the extension techniques that are carried out for the development of ecotourism within subak of sembung. this subak was selected by purposive sampling. is in subak of sembung, peguyangan village. key respondents were selected to get data needed. data collected by using interview, survey, observation and documentation. descriptive method was employed to analyzed data. the study pointed out that there are some problems encountered by subak in the development of ecotourism, such as the aspects of production, tourism education, and business management. therefore, it is needed the empowerment of subak to overcome the problems faced. the increase of crop production (corn, chili, eggplant, long beans, vegetables, cucumbers and also papaya) is carried out through direct extension and training activities in their rice fields. improvement of tourism education is also done through the extension activities for the subak members and management board of traditional village and the ecotourism managers, especially those concerning sapta pesona (seven of charm). strengthening of farmers’ capacity on business management is conducted through the extension training about post-harvest, such as processing, packaging, and marketing. it could be suggested to the subak and managers of ecotourism and traditional villages to have better synergy of their activities to ensure the sustainability of the development of ecotourism of subak of sembung. government should support ecotourism activities through the promotion of the existence ecotourism within subak.","subak, ecotourism, production, extension","Tourism development in Bali is very much based on agricultural culture of subak system. The agricultural sector in Denpasar City has a significant role in economic, cultural and environmental development. Rapid development in the city area led to the conversion of rice fields. One of the efforts made to control the conversion of rice fields is the development of ecotourism in Subak of Sembung. In the development of ecotourism within Subak of Sembung, there are still problems encountered by subak, such as the aspects of production, tourism education, and business management. Therefore, it is needed the empowerment of subak to overcome the problems faced. Increasing the production of non-rice crops is an important factor to be offered to visitors in the ecotourism area within Subak of Sembung. The kinds of crops planted by farmers are corn, chili, eggplant, long beans, vegetables, cucumbers and also papaya. The increase of crop production is carried out through direct extension and training activities for farmers in their rice fields. Tourism education is also conducted through the extension activities for the subak members together with the management board of traditional village and the ecotourism managers, especially those concerning sapta pesona (seven of charm). Capacity building of farmers in business management is done through the extension training about post-harvest, such as processing, packaging, and marketing of plant products to visitors and other communities. It could be suggested to the subak and managers of ecotourism and traditional villages to further enhance the synergy of their activities to ensure the sustainability of the development of ecotourism of Subak of Sembung. The role of the government as a facilitator and regulator is also needed to support ecotourism activities and at the same time to promote the existence ecotourism of Subak of Sembung.","denpasar, bali, indonesia gede sedana faculty of agriculture, dwijendra university, indonesia gedesedana@gmail.com ahad ali a. leon linton department of mechanical engineering, lawrence technological university southfield, mi 48075, usa aali@ltu.edu",

An intelligent randomization function is then designed to choose the rules for ranking the clusters based on the status of the search. In other words, the selection of each ranking function is subject to a probability whose value is dynamically updated by the history of the search. This indicates that the choice of the initial cluster is adaptive (and not deterministic) to the input data. The important issue is how to define and adjust the ranking criteria of the functions such that they continually complement each other throughout the search. This can be extended to form a pool of good-quality feasible solutions of diverse attributes as the initial solutions of a neighborhood search method (such as a local search) to establish optimality.","cross dock with stochastic planning javad khamisabadi department of industrial management firoozkooh branch islamic azad university, firoozkooh, iran javad_khamisabadi@yahoo.com mohammad reza kabaranzad ghadim associated professor faculty of management central tehran branch islamic azad university, tehran, iran hasan ali aghajani kasegar professor, faculty of management mazandaran university, iran mohammad mahdi movahedi assistant professor faculty of management firoozkooh branch islamic azad university, firoozkooh, iran",

To that end, we performed three classical forecasting methods, namely ARIMA (+ Fourier Terms), TBATS and ETS (+ STL), and one Machine Learning method which is Neural Network Autoregression, on the sales data of the 1L SKU. After plotting and comparing the measures of accuracy of the four methods (using MASE as a metric), we concluded that for the weekly sales data of the first SKU, the Neural Network Autoregression method yields more accuracy. Future work perspectives include exploring Recurrent Neural Networks and autoregressive models in deep learning, which are sequence models with multiple hidden layers, capable of extracting more features, and which might be useful for predicting times series.","ghita benboubker, dr. ilham kissani, dr. asmaa mourhir school of science and engineering al akhawayn university ifran, morocco g.benboubker@aui.ma i.kissani@aui.ma a.mourhir@aui.ma",

Facilitative leadership influences the implementation of academic quality policies. This research will help the nursing vocational school leaders to understand leadership to strengthen academic quality assurance in their respective institutions. Increased quality assurance for nursing vocational schools can be built by increasing various factors that influence the implementation of academic quality assurance. In accordance with the findings of the research, improving academic quality assurance can be done by increasing leadership through education and training. In addition, leaders must support and facilitate the activities of lecturers in implementing the Three Pillars of Higher Education. Leadership development programs must integrate leadership theory with leadership practices; provide opportunities to develop and demonstrate leadership competencies with a variety of active learning experiences including small group discussions and presentations, interviews, simulations, role plays, exercises, and group activities.","susi hartati departement of education management, universitas negeri jakarta, jl. rawamangun muka, rt.11/rw.14, rawamangun, pulo gadung, jakarta timur, jakarta 13220, indonesia departement of nursing, stikes mitra keluarga, jl. pengasinan rawa semut, margahayu, bekasi timur, jawa barat 17113, indonesia susihartati012@gmail.com mukhneri mukhtar, matin departement of education management, universitas negeri jakarta, jl. rawamangun muka, rt.11/rw.14, rawamangun, pulo gadung, jakarta timur, jakarta 13220, indonesia abdul talib bon department of production and operations, university tun hussein onn malaysia, malaysia talibon@gmail.com",
183,"The Government Expenditure Impact On The Private  Investment, Economic Growth, And Poverty In Maluku","the conclusions of this study are: (1) the government expenditure directly has a positive and significant effect on private investment in maluku; (2) the government expenditure directly has a negative effect on the economic growth in maluku; (3) the private investment directly has a positive effect on economic growth in maluku; (4) the government spending directly has a negative effect on the poverty in maluku; (5) the private investment directly has a negative and significant effect on the poverty in maluku; (6) the economic growth directly has a negative impact on the poverty in maluku; (7) the government spending indirectly has a positive effect on economic growth through private investment in maluku.; (8) the government spending indirectly has a negative impact on poverty through the private investment in maluku.; (9) the government expenditure indirectly has a positive effect on poverty through the economic growth in maluku province; (10) the private investment indirectly has a negative effect on poverty through the economic growth in maluku. keyword government expenditures, private investment, economic growth, poverty 1. introduction the poverty problem urges the government to immediately take concrete steps to overcome it, so that in national development, poverty alleviation is the highest priority. poverty reduction is directed at helping people below the poverty line and preventing new poverty. the province of maluku as well as an island province with great marine potential, it is also well known since long ago as a rich spice-producing island. despite the abundance of natural resources, poverty in maluku is still the highest in indonesia (bps, 2015). the depth and poverty severity index expressed by p1 and p2 shows a downward trend over the period 2013-2015, but in 2016, p1 slightly increased to 3.63 from 3.52 in march of 2015. this means there is an average increase on the gap in the standard of living of the poor compared to the poverty line. similarly, p2 in 2016 increased to 0.99 from 0.92 in 2015, meaning that the poverty gap between poor people also experienced a slight increase (bps, 2016). increasing the p1 score indicates that the standard of living of the poor declines and if the expenditure goes further away from the minimum standard of living (poverty line), it will be increasingly difficult to raise the status of non- poor, as well as the increase in the value of p2. if the inequality among the poor increases (indicated by the increased p2 value), the more difficult it is to suppress the poverty. the first step that needs to be done in addressing the problem of increasing the depth of poverty and increasing the number of poor people in maluku province is identifying factors causing the increase of the poverty. the government spending is one of the most effective means of government intervention on the economy. local government expenditure or known as regional expenditure in the regional budget, is one of the factors driving regional economic growth. the greater the regional expenditure is expected to increase the regional economic activity (economic expansion). 1401",,"Direct government spending has a positive and significant impact on private investment in Maluku Province. This means that the size of government spending can increase private investment in Maluku Province. a) Direct government spending negatively affects economic growth in Maluku Province. The direction of a negative relationship indicates that the greater the government's expenditure the lower the economic growth rate. This means that government spending in Maluku province has not been able to contribute to economic growth. b) Private investment directly affects the economic growth in Maluku Province. This means that the high private investment in Maluku province, then economic growth can be directly increased. c) Direct government spending negatively affects poverty in Maluku Province. This shows that large government expenditures will be able to reduce poverty in Maluku Province. d) Private investment directly affects negatively and significantly to poverty in Maluku Province. This shows that when private investment is increased, poverty in Maluku Province will decrease. e) Direct economic growth negatively affects poverty in Maluku Province. This indicates that the high economic growth will be able to reduce poverty in Maluku Province. f) Government spending indirectly positively affects economic growth through private investment in Maluku Province. This means that the size of government spending in Maluku Province can increase economic growth through private investment. g) Indirect government spending negatively affects poverty through private investment in Maluku Province. This means that increased government spending can reduce poverty in Maluku Province through private investment. h) Government spending indirectly affects positively to poverty through economic growth in Maluku Province. This means that increased government spending can increase poverty through economic growth. i) Private investment indirectly negatively affects poverty through economic growth in Maluku Province. This means that large private investment will be able to reduce poverty in Maluku Province through economic growth.

(widiastuti 2011) states that flexibility is the ability of the joint to carry out movements in a wide range of motion maximally. (tangkudung 2012) someone who has good flexibility is a person who can do a wide range of motion in his joints and which has elastic muscles. determination of benchmarks in this study is, the ability of muscle groups, ligaments and joints found on the trunk of the body or togok (collumna vertebralis) to carry out the movement of the body to make the jump style in lues, smooth without any significant obstacles to makelong jump movement (jay dawesand mark roozen 2011) power is defined as the ability to do work, this is a very important aspect in the expression of agility. this may be the determinant of success in athletic sports. (sukirno 2013) theability of a person to use the maximum power that is directed in the shortest possible time the muscles hold at high speed in one whole motion. power of the leg muscles has a very important role, because the leg muscles contribute to the initial motion, repulsion on the pedestal board to make the leap as far as possible. so the repulsion made by the leg muscles is repulsion with maximum strength. motivation has an important role in achieving success in activities, but not the only other factors. in sports activities it is suspected that the role of motivation has success in improving achievement. because sports activities to achieve high achievement require a long enough time, with various problems and obstacles that must be passed without 1413",,"Drawing conclusions is based on the findings of the study with variables consisting of tugkai muscle power, tooth shape and achievement motivation and long jump ability, as follows: a) There is a direct influence of leg muscle power on the long jump ability of University Sports Education students. This means that the ability of a well-trained long jump will result in an increase in the ability of the long jump. b) There is a direct effect of motivation motivating the ability of the long jump at the University of Palembang PGRI Student Sports Education.

186,Computer Guided Laparoscopic Surgery Training  Gage Driscoll,"with the increasing interfacing of healthcare and high technology, overwhelming amounts of research and praise have amassed in support of simulation-based training. though miles ahead of where it began, modern surgical simulation trainers range in fatal deficits, with the ‘most-equipped’ of them lacking functions as fundamental as assistive forces or even tactile sensation (haptic feedback) for training surgeons. the impediments that many of these modern systems possess have implications that prevent them from being the ultimate degree of surgical training, and prevent them from training ultimate surgeons. this poster is a presentation of the methods and functional advantages of the computer-aided surgical trainer (cast) with an overview of the system’s evolution. using the fundamentals of laparoscopic surgery (fls) as an objective learning metric, the cast system can train the highly specialized skills of laparoscopy to a surgeon without any of the risks or wasted resources associated with existing methods (mentor-trainee dynamics, cadavers, animals, etc.). by integrating sensors, image processing, machine learning, and augmented reality (ar) techniques, cast is able to provide the surgeon real-time feedback and guidance in the development of their skills in laparoscopy. 1769",,,"university of arizona honors college tucson, az 85719, usa",
187,Threshold Based Control Policy For Energy Storage  Operations With Demand Response And Renewable Energy,"in recent years, as climate change caused by co2 emission followed by a surge in energy consumption becomes growing serious environmental concerns, there has been a significant effort by industrial sectors to reform existing systems operations to improve energy efficiency and sustainability tied to the wide-spread of demand response program and the high penetration of renewable generations. followed by these efforts, many studies have been conducted to improve energy efficiency and sustainability in a wide range of industrial systems operations. given this, the co-location of renewable generation integrated with battery energy storage has been considered as a promising solution that enables many industries to realize energy-efficient and sustainable operations. considering co-located renewable generations, e.g., solar pv panels, integrated with battery energy storage, this study intends to develop a proper control policy for energy storage operations to minimize electricity cost while meeting time- varying electricity demand load in response to intermittent renewable generation and time-of-use electricity prices. specifically, this study proposes a threshold-based control policy by determining static time-varying thresholds on the state of charge level using two-stage stochastic programming based on historical data. the proposed threshold- based control policy can be applied to energy storage operations by adjusting charging and discharging energy storage to ensure the threshold has the minimum state of charge level of energy storage.","energy storage, demand response, renewable energy",,"awnalisa walker and soongeol kwon department of systems science and industrial engineering binghamton university, state university of new york (suny) binghamton, ny 13902, usa awalke23@binghamton.edu, skwon@binghamton.edu",
188,The Implications Of Uncertainty In The Results Of Simulation  Models,"simulation is a common engineering tool used to investigate the performance of complex systems where the input parameters are usually stochastic. as a consequence, simulation models contain both simulation and input uncertainty in their estimates. in this work, through an illustrative example, we show the implications of uncertainty in the results of simulation models and why it is important to acknowledge and, whenever possible, to quantify uncertainty in the simulation results. to investigate the implications of uncertainty in the results of simulation models a simple queue model was built in simio® university enterprise edition v 10.165. the model consists of a single source of arrivals, single queue, and 𝑠𝑠 servers providing the same service. after being served, customers leave the system. balking and reneging were not considered in the model. two input parameters were considered in the model, namely the inter- arrival time and the service time, and two output responses were considered, namely the average number of customers in the system and the average time spent in the system. several scenarios were run with different number of replications, different traffic intensities, different number of servers, different variances, different distributions, different parameter values, and different seeds. the run length of each scenario was 1,825 days, which included 365 days of warm-up. the specified warm-up period was enough for the system to reach steady state for all the experiments. due to the simplicity of the system, one would expect to obtain accurate results in the simulation model. however, the results show that this was not always the case. as it is known, the intrinsic output-uncertainty (or simulation uncertainty) tends to decrease with the increase in the sample size, but interestingly in this work, for m/m/s systems, the highest individual absolute error was always observed for 400 replications, regardless of the configuration, which was not the lowest number of replications. although the experiments of this work are simple queue models, the situation can be actually worse, because the uncertainty level in more complex systems may be much higher than the ones observed here. these results do not indicate that simulation results cannot support decision- making or have no use. rather, the results show that it is important to adequately inform decision-makers and simulation stakeholders about the uncertainties and the consequent risks involved in their decisions while using simulation models. as the quote says: “something is better than nothing”. a partially informed decision has higher chances of success than a simple blind guess.","simulation, uncertainty, brazil. 1425",,"anna paula galvão scheidegger industrial and systems engineering department texas a&m university college station, tx 77845, usa apscheidegger@tamu.edu",
189,Managing A Green Building Architecture For Sustainable  Energy Consumption By System Approach,": the more energy usage increases around the world the closer critical situation for supplying energy will encounter the nations. there will no way remain except optimal energy consumption moreover finding new energy resources. renewable energies nowadays are the core concern of many researchers. replacing fossil-based energy generation by other resources of renewable energies like wind and solar are started in the past decades. a system approach is applied in this research to present a model to analyze how building architecture and constructions could be improved toward green energy usage. renewable energies will increase the incentives of the environmental protection, clean supply and demand in the huge energy consumers’ sectors like industries. it is concluded that environmental issues are a matter of concern for people, they cannot tolerate the higher expenses of green energy generation. they prefer to use cheap energy resources mainly non-renewables. the model confirmed the supporting policies both to generation and consumption will dramatically improve green energy usage. the governments can support both supplying and demand sides to decrease their energy expenses and give the people some incentive to use renewable subsidized energy and also earning by selling their extra generated power to the grid.","energy management, green generation, architecture","This study figures out some important factors affecting energy consumption. Architectural consideration of a building to decrease energy wastes and improve energy saving to have a sustainable energy management are the other concern of the conceptual proposed model.

Electric car manufacturers need to test under “real world” scenarios to produce more accurate driving ranges for short-range EVs. Accurate kilometers available to travel will help with range anxiety of many consumers. Testing in a lab environment using only movement of the tires while the car body remains in a fixed position is not producing accurate results for use by consumers.

193,Analysis Of Personal Area Networks For Zigbee  Environment Using Random Early Detection-Active Queue,"so much interest has been drawn to producing more devices that will constitute the internet of things (iot), however, the means to organize these devices into a network of things has remained a grey area. with the bulk of the emphasis channeled towards proliferating the number of embedded systems to compensate their growing demand, designing different iot concepts and applications, and also prototyping different wireless sensor networks, a little concern has been directed to the study of quality of service relative to the exploding amount of data expected in the iot network. in a typical iot-based smart home network, just as in our case, a zigbee network, end devices send an enormous amount of data to the coordinator and other end devices through intermediary devices like routers. this, as a result, creates overhead application traffic in the coordinator’s queue. the built-up queue causes congestion and subsequent dropping of packets, increasing delay and reducing throughput. therefore, it becomes imperative to develop an operative active queue model that will ensure quick and reliable data mobility within or by across multiple personal area networks (pans). this paper investigates a power-efficient zigbee-enabled smart home network that employs the random early detection-active queue management (red-aqm) model to provide reliable data transport in the smart home context. we focus on the simulation of different network topologies for single and multiple pans and identify the optimal network setup when using red-aqm.","internet of things, zigbee","This paper analyzes the RED algorithm in ZigBee network for queue management. It also reveals the effect of having more than PAN for a given number of nodes in a tree topology setting. The analysis shows that when RED active queue management is deployed in Tree Topology, there is improved throughput, less delays and data traffic dropped. Having settled that Tree topology outperformed Mesh and Star, we decided to examine the effect of having two ZigBee Coordinators, creating two different PANs, in the existing network. Interestingly, this did not indicate any enhancement for the Tree topology, although it did for Mesh by having 2ZCs.","management model ekele a. asonye and sarhan m. musa electrical and computer engineering department prairie view a&m university, texas, usa easonye@student.pvamu.edu, smmusa@pvamu.edu","References

Initially on an average all the process of changeover from tool, mold, pin, plate and final connector it used to take on an average 95 min but now after implementing the six sigma tools it helped to remove this time consuming process of changeover now new time for the changeover for head tool, mold, plate, pin and final connector came to on an average of 70 min which is really a good improvement. By use of six sigma tools the real problem causing factors where found in analyze phase which made it very clear that head tool changeover took a lot of time delay which may have been caused by new worker or tools are not in the required place as which resulted in the delay and more time for the changeover of tool. The other problem identified in analyze phase was mold changeover also took lot of time as the location of the mold storage area was far off from the machine which resulted in time delay in changeover operation of mold. In improve phase the location of mold storage was changed from the previous in which the new one was now very next to the machines, therefore now it became very easy for the operator to pick the required mold to be change in less time which helped to decrease the overall changeover time just by simply modifying the location of mold storage area. In this project SMED single minute exchange of die concept is used in which it is made sure that all the changeover of the parts takes place in just one minute or must not exceed 10 minutes. 7.","kaustubh kale a. leon linton department of mechanical engineering lawrence technological university southfield, mi 48075, usa kkale@ltu.edu",

Renewable Resources,"humans keep using limited resources inefficiently without realizing that these resources will deplete to a small amount sometime in the future. with the ever-growing world, it is nearly impossible to rely solely on these resources for a long-term duration, the reason being why these resources should be changed for renewable ones. another major reason to look for alternate resources is that non-renewable sources are environmentally unfriendly. global warming and high levels of co2 in the atmosphere have forced us to think about alternative for these resources. the renewable resources’ objectives dominate beneficially above from the minor contradictory ones that can be presented.","renewable energy, resources, alternate",,"nora pamela rubalcaba bachelor’s in science of industrial and systems engineering the university of texas at el paso el paso, tx 79915 usa nprubalcaba@miners.utep.edu",

This model can be used for the design of the plant and for all the engineering activities through the plant life cycle. Our adopted approach summarizes various modeling tools working with a well-known industrial partner in Phosphate valorization. Using these approaches, we will guarantee efficient beneficiation processes by optimizing their operating parameters. Simulation through Excel allows the analysis of properties and performance of each equipment. In future works, we will investigate the possibility to generate Excel simulation from any SysML model by defining a map from SysML to Excel elements.","phosphate industry mariem ait bakader applied organic chemistry laboratory faculty of sciences and technics, sidi mohamed ben abdellah university, fes fes, morocco complex systems engineering laboratory mohammed vi polytechnic university, benguerir benguerir, morocco, mariem.aitbakader@usmba.ac.ma, mariem.aitbakader@um6p.ma laurent deshayes complex systems engineering mohammed vi polytechnic university, benguerir benguerir, morocco laurent.deshayes@um6p.ma mohammed el asri applied organic chemistry laboratory faculty of sciences and technics, sidi mohamed ben abdellah university, fes, morocco fes, morocco mohammedelasri@yahoo.fr",

208,Quality Management In Construction Projects Richard Hannis Ansah1 And Xueqing Zhang1,"quality management represents an increasing concern and a critical issue for project managers. non- conformance to quality usually result in failures and defects, which may possibly require reconstruction, even with minor design and operations defects. failures or defects in constructed projects can result in extensive costs, increased delays, and in the worst case, fatalities, injuries and other safety concerns. as the most important decisions are made during design and planning phases, components configurations, functional performance, and material specifications must be embedded in quality control to ensure conformance to original design and planning decisions during the construction process. this article focuses on the growing debate generated by researchers and project teams into how quality management should respond to the challenges of defects and failures of construction projects. also, the research should reflect on the concepts of quality control or quality assurance (qc/qa), quality management systems, quality work functions, quality control versus quality assurance, quality management application to projects, project quality and energy-related regulations, design quality issues, site inspections, conformance to quality management requirements by project managers, and the benefits and challenges. the key questions are “how does quality management addresses defects and failures in construction projects?” and “how do we meet the challenges and achieve the benefits of quality management?” drawing on literature, case studies, and secondary data. the rest of the article is keen to an explication and critical appraisal of the quality management standards in the construction industries in developing economies. it is a step that requires further analysis, and that provide project managers with a window of hope, of taking control, of defects and failures of construction projects.","defect, failure, quality management",,"1department of civil and environmental engineering, hong kong university of science and technology email: rhansah@ust.hk, zhangxq@ust.hk",
209,Enhancement Of Gaming Experience And Performance  Through An Ergonomically Designed Console Chair,"posture has an important role in mobility, breathing, muscle efficiency, and injury prevention for any human activity, including console gaming. proper posture allows players to minimize the work muscles needed to exert while playing, thus allowing them to play for longer durations of time without much discomfort. one of the key features of proper posture is correct positioning of the shoulder blades, which is affected by the position of the thoracic spine. this study involves the construction of an ergonomic console chair dedicated to a specific demographic in order to improve the posture and comfort that experience while playing, with its dimensions being based specifically on the average filipino male workers body measurements. one design the researchers proposed incorporated an underarm support system meant to guide the shoulder blades into proper position, thus overall improving the user’s posture. to further test the effects of using this ergonomic chair, it was compared to that of an ordinary non-ergonomic chair, in terms of its effects on the user’s comfort and performance. prior observation in a local gaming shop was done to study what posture related problems players experienced while playing. in addition, both a pre- experiment and a post-experiment survey were conducted to test the chair’s effect on the user’s comfort and experience. the experiment proper had participants play two gaming sessions on each chair, with the variable in question being the scores each player attained per session. after gathering all necessary data, various statistical tools were used to determine the chair’s effectiveness. based on the statistics, the ergonomic console chair has proved to be effective in improving a user’s experience and performance.","posture, experience, performance 31",,"alma maria jennifer gutierrez lorenzo cadiz nathaniel filoteo ivan juan bryan leopando industrial engineering de la salle university manila, philippines alma.gutierrez@dlsu.edu.ph","References

Since the setbacks faced are all outside of the country’s borders, private profits must put aside to accelerate securing alternative sources of energy. The main aim of this research was to place the distinct experiences of Jordan’s acquisition of energy in a broader empirical set of research, coming to conclusions and recommendations based upon experience and observation rather than theory or logic, and to place Jordan’s energy sector in the larger context of the global economic crisis, the Arab Spring, and the Egyptian Revolution.

212,The Impact Of Effective Work Design And Ergonomics On  Employee’S Productivity In Higher Education Institutions In,"the purpose of the study is to investigate and uncover the impact work design and ergonomics have on employee productivity in an academic working environment. human beings have been working since the beginning of time and work has evolved and transformed since. now we are in the fourth industrial revolution and the employment sector is still in transformation. humans are either negatively or positively impacted by the job they engage in on a daily basis and this research aims to unravel whether that impact negative or positive does it increase or decrease employee productivity in the workplace and in an environment of academia. the study also aims to suggest solutions on how to improve work design and ergonomics in an academic environment and to recommend possible strategies on how employee can perform better given the proper working conditions and work design. the labour relations act, occupational health and safety act and the basic conditions of employment act provides employees and employers in the 21st century guidelines, rules and laws on how the employment sector should run nowadays but the research study aims to unravel whether these acts are being followed thoroughly or not and if employers are adhering to these laws which inevitably if adhered to product happier workers and healthier workers with no back pain and spine problems due to incorrect working conditions. 52",,and Recommendations The research findings indicate that much more efforts are to be put in supporting employees working in the higher education institutions with regards to ergonomics and work design. The research also uncovered that there is indeed a relationship between proper work design and ergonomics and employee productivity. Proper work design and ergonomics help motivate employee because they are working comfortably and thus more work performance is achieved but if there is incorrect and improper ergonomics and work design inevitably less productivity and more absenteeism is the result. Recommendation is employers in higher education institutions must ensure that health and safety check and done and improvement of work design and ergonomics is done on a continuous and constant basis in order to manage the employee work demands and to support the employee. 6.,"pretoria east, gauteng mrs thobile yvonne bhila faculty of engineering and the built environment department of quality and operations management university of johannesburg auckland park, south africa bdc.thobile@gmail.com dr e i edoun faculty of engineering and the built environment department of quality and operations management university of johannesburg auckland park, south africa eiedoun@uj.ac.za professor c mbohwa faculty of engineering and the built environment department of quality and operations management university of johannesburg auckland park, south africa cmbohwa@uj.ac.za",
213,"The Impact Of Greening Practices And Employee Productivity  In The Restaurant Business In Johannesburg North, South","the research seeks to uncover and investigate whether greening practices have an impact on employee morale and work performance that is productivity in the workplace. human factors are defined as the study that describes human behavior mentally and physically when affected by particular conditions, environments, products and services. wastage is an environment that affect employees negatively due to various factors namely filth, smell, dirt, pests etc, and this has a direct implication to their health and how they feel about coming to work. the conditions of working in a restaurant business are very favorable because of longs hours of standing, walking, carry plates, dealing with difficult customers etc and so an addition of unclean/ unhygienic surroundings is an added disadvantage. greening standards comes in with added tasks but a more pleasant workplace and environment. the studies have proved that motivated and happy employees inevitably perform better in the workplace that is why the study aims at investigating how employees feel about greening practices and if the practices have a positive or negative impact on the employees and thus their performance on a daily basis. restaurants contribute significant amounts to the gdp of all countries and so improvement of elements that impact the industry is imperative. restaurants that are successfully implementing greening standards should teach and assist other restaurants to master what they have mastered. the research aims to unravel this concept and find possible solutions to solve the problems discovered in the study. 62",,Employees have shown from this study that greening practices assist them in many ways in the workplace and the cleaner and hygienic the restaurant is the more they are encouraged and happy it is to be working there and thus their productivity increases. This research has proved that the more we train employees on greening standards the more they participate and are motivated to practice them on a daily basis and the more productive they become in the work place which means direct financial rewards for the employer. This is a clear positive impact that greening standards have on employee morale and work performance. 6.,"africa mrs thobile yvonne bhila faculty of engineering and the built environment department of quality and operations management university of johannesburg auckland park, south africa bdc.thobile@gmail.com dr e i edoun faculty of engineering and the built environment department of quality and operations management university of johannesburg auckland park, south africa eiedoun@uj.ac.za professor c mbohwa faculty of engineering and the built environment department of quality and operations management university of johannesburg auckland park, south africa cmbohwa@uj.ac.za",

222,Optimal Preventive Maintenance Strategy Using  Reinforcement Learning,"taking optimal maintenance decisions is a challenging process as different maintenance actions have different effects on the system. maintenance is defined as a set of associated techniques, tools and management actions that aim to maintain or restore the functioning state of the system. maintenance excellence is the balance between performance and risk, therefore this helps improve the sustainability of production. traditionally, maintenance decisions are taken based on human experience and on the basic information known about the system. with the availability of data collected during the system’s life cycle; machine learning approaches can help develop optimal strategies for maintenance actions. this paper proposes and depicts an optimization model imported from the machine learning field and developed to find optimal preventive maintenance strategies. the main objective of this developed optimization model is to minimize the downtime and allow the system to take autonomous decisions. in this work, the maintenance strategy is modeled as a markov decision process (mdp). mdp is a classical forming of sequential decision-making problem. reinforcement learning (rl) model is then developed to solve the problem interactively. rl uses the mdp to define the interaction between the learning agent and the environment. the final output from this method in an optimal policy allows providing optimal actions in different situations.",,"The objective of this work aimed to find an optimal PM strategy, using RL area imported from the machine learning. This maintenance strategy minimizes the downtime of the systems. The proposed solution in this work to this problem is to develop RL model that could be solved by SARSA (λ) algorithm. First, the challenges related to the maintenance problem are described with the limitations of the available models. Mainly these limitations are both the need and the high dependency of the available models on the input parameters and their values. The proposed model overcomes this limitation. In the proposed solution the problem was modeled as MDP, the developed model was based on the reliability of the system. The Reliability was obtained using the Kaplan-Meier estimate. Then an optimal solution to the problem was founded by the SARSA(λ) algorithm. The problem was solved without the need for the transition probabilities matrix. In addition, the proposed model is not dependent on any parameters as the failure distribution function, tp or tf. These capabilities of RL as a nonparametric data-driven model enable it to solve real-time problem of autonomous decision-making. To evaluate the performance of the proposed model, a numerical comparison between the original model and the proposed model through discrete event simulation was performed. The proposed model outperformed the original model in two different cases, as the proposed model provides T* that yield less downtime when used to perform PM actions. Areas for further research are: i. solve the limitation related to failure allowance as in case of the brake. ii. extend the model for the multicomponent systems, so all the components are considered together in the same model. iii. extend the model to include minimizing the maintenance cost explicitly in the objective.","mina mikhail mina.mikhail@polymtl.ca soumaya yacout soumaya.yacout@polymtl.ca mohamed-salah ouali mohamed-salah.ouali@polymtl.ca department of mathematics and industrial engineering, polytechnique montréal, canada",

224,Implementation Of Association Rule-Market Basket Analysis  In Determining Product Bundling Strategy: Case Study Of,"the increasing retail industry in indonesia makes competitiveness among retail businesses even higher. therefore, a good marketing strategy is important to do. retail z is a retailer that sells handphone (hp) and electronic accessories, which want to increase sales with limited capital. one of strategy that can be done is product bundling. however, a product bundling strategy that is incompatible with customer needs will be in vain. therefore, a technique is needed to determine which product will be bundled. by using one of the data mining methods namely association rule-market basket analysis it can be determined which products are often purchased simultaneously by taking into account the parameters of support and confidence. results obtained with the help of rapidminer software, department 5 and department 2 are departments whose products are often purchased simultaneously. this is indicated by lift ratio 1.029, confidence 0.852 and support 0.397. so that product bundling can be done by giving discounts to buyers who make product purchases in department 5 and in department 2 simultaneously.","association rule, product bundling, data mining","Based on the research that has been done on Retail Z using the AR-MBA method, it can be concluded that by using a minimum value of Support which is 0.3 or 30% and the minimum value of Confidence 0.6 or 60%, there are 6 rules based on the output of RapidMiner. From the 6 rules obtained, only 1 rule can be said to be valid, namely the sixth rule that describes the associative relationship between items in Department 5 (Memory & Games) will be purchased simultaneously with items in Department 2 (HP Support Accessories) with a confidence level of 85 % and supported by 39% of all data. Therefore, the proposed solution to increase sales with product bundling based on AR-MBA analysis in Retail Z is that the customer gets a discount if buying items included in department 5 (Memory & Games) and department 2 (HP Supporting Accessories) , for example, the customer will get a discount when buying a hard drive with a charger simultaneously.","retail businesses in indonesia zakka ugih rizqi department of industrial engineering islamic university of indonesia yogyakarta, indonesia ugihzakka@gmail.com",
225,Longitudinal Effects Of Team-Based Training On Students’  Peer Rating Quality,"this paper examines peer rating result data for two consecutive core team-based first year engineering courses. engineering students will be expected to work in teams, and the ability to effectively cooperate and communicate is increasingly recognized by technical corporations. teamwork is an important outcome included in the accreditation criteria of abet, and is also progressively integrated into engineering courses. however, the effect of the length of students’ exposure into team-based projects training is not well studied. given the ad-hoc experience, which is the more students experience teamwork, the better they perform in teams, we hypothesize that peer evaluation behaviors for the second team-based course will be better on average comparing to the first team-based course. this study will further help better bridge college students with industry in terms of teamwork competency. it will also inspire university administrators and instructors to design curriculums that help engineering students improve teaming skills.","teamwork, peer evaluation",,"siqing wei, daniel m. ferguson, matthew w. ohland, behzad beigpourian, chuhan zhou department of engineering education purdue university west lafayette, indiana, usa wei118@purdue.edu, dfergus@purdue.edu, ohland@purdue.edu, bbeigpou@purdue.edu, zhou818@purdue.edu",

Four governorates and years were included to distinguish the differences between them with respect to traffic accidents that resulted in 287983 crashes, rollovers, and run-over accidents. The statistics showed that the accidents decreased through the four years. In addition, governorate the had the higher rate of traffic accidents during the selected years was identified which was Hawally. For the rollover accidents, Al Ahmadi was recognized as the governorate that had the highest rollovers accidents compared to other governorates. Run-over accidents were significantly higher in Al Farwaniya governorate. Afterward, a multinomial logit regression was applied to identify the significant predictors and determine the correlation between independent variables and the dependent variable. The results showed that both the location and time were significant variables related to traffic accidents types occurrence. The applied model confirmed that Al Ahmadi governorate had a higher probability of having rollover accidents compared to other governorates. Moreover, 2017 had higher odds of having run-over accidents compared to the other three selected years. All in all, this study can be considered as a baseline for future studies that concern with traffic accidents in Kuwait due to the lack of similar studies. This study can help policy-makers, related institutions, police departments and ministry of interior in locating the area that is correlated with the three traffic accidents types. Additionally, this study can help in evaluating the newly established rules regarding mitigating and lessening traffic accidents through the selected time-period and locations in Kuwait. 168","civil engineering department, college of engineering and petroleum, kuwait university, p.o. box-5969, 13060, safat, kuwait. sharaf.alkehder@ku.edu.kw, f.alrukaibi@ku.edu.kw, ahmad.aiash@grad.ku.edu.kw","References

228,Delegation Versus Control Under Competition And  Bargaining Power Distribution In Supply Chain,"this paper studies the optimal strategies of procuring components in a three-tier supply chain setting, including two competing original equipment manufacturers (oem), a contract manufacturer (cm) and a supply market. the oems sell substitutable products in the same market. the oems are dependent on the cm to perform significant manufacturing tasks or customized processing services. the cm also needs a key component for performing its task; this key component should be procured from an upstream supplier. to procure the key component, each oem has two options; it can either procure directly through the supply market or delegate procurement process to the cm. the oems procurement game has been analyzed under a nonstrategic supplier case where a quantity discount schedule is exogenously given. the optimal component procurement strategy has been characterized at different levels of quantity discount rates offered by the upstream supplier.","procurement, delegation",,"procurement parisa rahimi industrial engineering department iran university of science and technology tehran, iran rhm.parisa@gmail.com ehsan bolandifar business school the chinese university of hong kong, hong kong ehsan@baf.cuhk.edu.hk rassoul noorossana industrial engineering department iran university of science and technology tehran, iran rassoul@iust.ac.ir delegation versus control under competition and bargaining power distribution in supply chain procurement",
229,A Discrete Event Simulation Logic For Semiconductor  Production Planning And Control Within Industry 4.0,"the recent advancement in digital technologies has encouraged manufacturers to adopt intelligent data analysis and decision-making support tools to leverage their competitiveness. they have become challenged by the need for more flexible and complex manufacturing systems. this complexity and flexibility cannot be handled efficiently with traditional production management paradigms, such as lean management. semiconductor industry is an example of a complex production, in which high level of flexibility is required to meet a continuously changing customer demand. this limits the efficiency of static modeling approaches and it reflects negatively on the overall production yield. in this research, we propose a discrete event simulation logic for assessment of several challenging production management-related problems at a semiconductor manufacturer. the logic includes scheduling and processing a large variety of products, while respecting relative priorities and customers’ needs. it also accounts for production resources, equipment and operators, with variable availability. our simulation logic is data-driven, in which data that drives the different actions taken within the execution of the simulation, is compiled. consequently, the model is highly flexible to continuous changes in the model’s parameters. the proposed logic provides a quick and risk-free tool for capacity planning and reliable experimentation with different ‘what-if’ scenarios.",complex production,"and Future works The semiconductor industry is an example of a complex production due to the manufacturing technologies and the flexibility required to satisfy customer requirements. The manufacturers always seek for reaching production performance improvement in order to keep a high level of competitiveness. This implies the implementation of untraditional production management strategies that can handle the increased level of production complexity. Such problems are addressed by the applications of the Industry 4.0 concepts that adopt the IoT technologies and synchronized system models which copies the actual system continuously. The basis of having a good representative model is selecting proper methodology and type of modeling that is able to simulate the behaviors of the actual system. Nevertheless, it should be continuously monitoring the actual system to adapt for any modifications that may occur. We proposed a methodology for modeling a production system for semiconductors using discrete-event simulation model that is both Data-driven and Agent-based. The proposed logic is easily applicable using Arena® simulation software. Our logic included the flexibility for accepting any updates in the model parameters with no need for rebuilding the model. This was realized while keeping the modeling as simple as possible to be easily assessed and validated. Future work for this research involves conducting design of experiments with the model results for real input data to understand different relationships between model outputs and different model parameters and inputs. This would help solving different problems and improving the general production performance of the actual system.","paradigm ahmed h. sakr mathematics and industrial engineering department école polytechnique de montréal montréal, canada ahmed-1.sakr@polymtl.ca soumaya yacout mathematics and industrial engineering department école polytechnique de montréal montréal, canada soumaya.yacout @polymtl.ca samuel bassetto mathematics and industrial engineering department école polytechnique de montréal montréal, canada samuel-jean.bassetto@polymtl.ca",
230,Merging Logical Analysis Of Data Models  Osama Elfar And Soumaya Yacout,"logical analysis of data (lad) is a classification algorithm known for its high accuracy and interpretable results, but it has relatively long computational time, which makes it unsuitable to treat big data. in this paper, we propose a platform for improving the computational efficiency of lad especially in large scale and big data applications. we develop an approach based on a merging operation of two different lad models. the proposed approach is ideal to develop incremental learning platform based on lad. in addition, it enables lad to be performed in parallel computing environments. the suggested operation determines the intersection between each pair of patterns from the two models. each intersection is a new pattern in the new merged model and its characteristics are inherited from its parent patterns. numerical experiments are conducted by using an industrial data set. the experiments demonstrate the trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency of the proposed approach and the classical implementation of lad with a sole run on the whole data. the proposed approach resulted in a maximum accuracy reduction of 5% and computational time reduction of 87% from the accuracy and computational time of the classical implementation of lad, respectively.",merging lad models,"In this paper, we developed an efficient merging operation for different sets of patterns which are produced by performing LAD on different data subsets. The motivation behind this operation is developing incremental learning framework using LAD and allowing LAD to process big data sets in parallel computing environments. We evaluated the proposed technique in terms of pattern’s quality, accuracy and computational time. Overall, the quality of the patterns is reduced in terms of the degrees and weights comparing to the patterns produced by a single run of LAD, but the accuracy and the computational time are promising to apply the proposed technique in an incremental learning platform and parallel computing environments. In the future research, we plan to modify the merging operation for the incremental learning platform by adding some tuning parameters to reduce the noise of new chunks of data until building a robust model. In addition, LAD will be implemented on different parallel computing systems using this merging operation and will be evaluated using various data sets.","mathematical and industrial engineering department école polytechnique de montréal montréal, québec, canada h3c 3a7 osama.elfar@polymtl.ca, soumaya.yacout@polymtl.ca hany osman systems engineering department king fahd university of petroleum & minerals, kfupm dhahran, 31261, kingdom of saudi arabia hanyosman@kfupm.edu.sa said berriah research and development department r2 intelligent technologies montréal, québec, canada, h2y 3x7 said.berriah@r2.ca",

For the manufacturers who are looking for embracing the new paradigm, the opportunities are as follows (Andrews, 2017): • An opportunity to tackle the complex problem of rapid changes of customers’ requirements and the obligation to answer to these requirements in a short time interval, and with high product’s quality. The use of information technologies and the internet has been proven highly efficient in all aspects of our lives. It is thus logical to expect the same result of efficiency when large volume of heterogeneous information is rapidly gathered from all the processes of an industrial network, then smartly analyzed to support smart the decision making. • The cost and the variety of the available information technology are more affordable than ever, whether it is the cloud-based services, the open-source artificial intelligence tools, or the sensors that can track the tools and equipment states around the factory. • Many governments and coalitions are alerted to the importance of this change of paradigm, and are willing to invest for upgrading their industries. For example, the German government invested 500 million Euros to encourage research into Industry 4.0. In the USA, technology firms, manufactures, suppliers, government agencies and universities have formed the Smart Manufacturing Leadership Coalition, a not-for-profit- organization funded by 140 million $ of public and private investments. In the UK, the government had announced that 4.7 billion pounds would be available for research and development into areas such as robotics, artificial intelligence, 5G mobile and smart energy. However, the new paradigm of Industry 4.0 presents some challenges for the Industry (Andrews, 2017): • Since Industry 4.0 is a disruptive concept by nature, and people usually resist any changes, it is expected that some high and middle management officers and employees will adopt a conservative attitude, and express concerns about the required changes. • It is already clear that it is hard to find people having the required qualifications and digital skills to run the new systems, and to adapt them to the future technologies. 226","soumaya yacout department of mathematics and industrial engineering polytechnique montreal, montreal, quebec, h3t1j4 soumaya.yacout@polymtl.ca","References

238,Developing A Framework For Evaluation Of A Digital  Maintenance Management System,"the increasing demand for productivity, quality and availability is driving the need for the effective management of physical assets. the depletion of traditional cost cutting, the disadvantages associated with rapid growth and the management of change has caused companies to explore more effective and efficient options. not only do organisations have to meet customer needs and improve the availability and performance of equipment, organisations also need to do so while also reducing operational costs. these factors have led to the increasing concentration on reliability within the business sector, specifically strategic maintenance management. digital maintenance management systems are software-based systems used for managing and controlling plant and equipment maintenance in modern manufacturing and service industries. many companies make use of such systems to ensure the effective management of physical assets, which plays an enormously important role in maintaining a proﬁtable business. historically, selecting a digital maintenance management system was simple and required minimal research, however, as markets become saturated with various types of maintenance software and technologies become more advanced, selecting digital maintenance management systems is becoming more complex. the main objective of this research is to develop of a framework for evaluating and selecting digital maintenance management systems. the research approach for this study applies a combination of various methods. results analysis focuses on the current status of the maintenance management system, business needs and priorities. the results indicate that the toolset developed is effective in evaluating and selecting digital maintenance management systems that are of best practice and cater to the specific needs of the business.",evaluation toolset,"The outcome of this research answers the following research questions; what is the international best practice in terms of maintenance management systems and what methods are used to evaluate and/or select maintenance management systems. For this study, data is extracted by means of a literature survey. In the literature survey, various methods for evaluating and/or select maintenance management systems are discussed and the standardized approach, which is the most common and simplest approach, mixed with other methods is used. This then answers the research question, what methods are used to evaluate and/or select maintenance management systems. The data gathered on best practice maintenance management systems, which answers the research question, what is the international best practice in terms of maintenance management systems, is used is develop an engagement toolset. This toolset/framework is then tested on a set of employees to establish its effectiveness in extracting data required for optimal selection or evaluation. The results from the test indicates that a fully integrated system does exist for the majority of functionalities relative to best practice. There are some aspects however, that are not integrated and still function independently. This specific business should pay close attention to maintenance strategies, linking resource demand to criterions, effectiveness of the tools used for scheduling work orders, remote monitoring as well as KPI generation. From the result it is also apparent that the toolset developed is effective in evaluating and selecting digital maintenance management systems that are of best practice and cater to the specific needs of the business. This in evident in the amount relevant and useful data that was extracted from the test. Having such a system in place has the potential to contribute significantly to business proﬁtability. A toolset such as this, aids in ensuring that the maintenance management system put in place, meets all the unique needs of the business and ensures the efficient management of physical assets thus reducing operational costs and improving the availability and performance of physical assets. This enables the business to secure a vantage point over competitors and puts the business in a better position to manage challenges associated with the increasing demand on productivity, quality, availability, advances in technology and competition.","maleho m and telukdarie arnesh post graduate school of engineering management university of johannesburg auckland park, 2092, south africa mmaleho75@gmail.com, arnesht@uj.ac.za",

Operational data comprised of maintenance and financial values for LHD fleet operating at the underground hard rock mine. The outcome of this study suggests that LHD fleet in question is operating with components or subsystems which are in the middle of the wear out stage in the bathtub curve (research question 1). It is evident that the expansion project maintenance team does not employ condition monitoring techniques to detect possible failures in order to apply preventive maintenance techniques. There is a correlation between four of the top twenty percentile subsystems which accounted for eighty percent of LHD fleet failures and associated cost thereof. The maintenance team must concentrate the effort in attempting to improve reliability and optimization of maintenance strategy as per the following priorities (http://www.au.af.mil/au): • Priority one – Common top twenty percent subsystems as determined in Figure 4 and 5, such subsystems comprise of fittings and hoses, electrical subsystem, engine and transmission. • Priority two – the remainder of top twenty percent subsystems presented in Figure 4 (Pareto analysis of subsystems failures), but do not form part of top twenty percent subsystems presented in Figure 5 (Pareto analysis for system maintenance spend), such subsystems comprise of air conditioning and brakes. • Priority three – the remainder of top twenty percent subsystems presented in Figure 5, but do not form part of top twenty percent subsystems presented in Figure 4, such subsystems comprise of OEM special maintenance cost and the boom. 279","mpho manenzhe, telukdarie arnesh and medoh chuks post graduate school of engineering management university of johannesburg auckland park, 2092, south africa mtmtman1@gmail.com, arnesht@uj.ac.za, medoh6001@gmail.com","References

An electoral structure developed on the basis of 4IR implementations enables electorate view the electoral process as a process and not an event. This limits manipulation, fraud, security anxieties, and violence. Exploring best practices relative to the measures electoral process dynamics is evaluated is critical in enhancing electoral reforms, democratic principles and realizing a genuine representation. This research focused on exploring the implications of the electoral system in Nigeria as a subset of the African context based on fourth industrial revolutions. 4IR implementations are the big unexploited current technological trends relative to the electoral structure. This research document is a significant tool for developing countries relative to electoral assessment and implementations. Electoral stakeholders must rethink and redevelop strategies to align the electoral process with the 4IR implementations. This research output seeks to mitigate the skepticism and mistrust experienced by electorates relative to the electoral process effectively representing democratic and civic interests.","post graduate school of engineering management university of johannesburg auckland park, 2092, south africa medoh6001@gmail.com, arnesht@uj.ac.za",
242,Exploring Industry 4.0 Technologies As Drivers Of Lean And  Agile Supply Chain Strategies,"the present global competition is forcing companies to expand and connect their “internal improvement processes” with “external customers and suppliers”. ensuring success in the face of fierce competition requires careful adoption of supply chain (sc) strategies alongside innovative capabilities such as industry 4.0 technologies to enable such sc strategies. to improve organization’s competitiveness and performance, modern day businesses are exploring the integration of sc strategies. lean and agile are two critical strategies because the former ensures efficient use of resources while the latter involves matching supply with demand in turbulent/unpredictable markets. several studies have considered integration of different strategies/paradigms and their associated impact on sc; however, few have considered how industry 4.0 technologies could enable these sc strategies for improved performance. this study presents a conceptual model that matches various principles/practices of lean and agile sc with industry 4.0 technologies (as drivers) for overall performance improvement. the conceptual model provides a decision supporting tool for practitioners at identifying potential industry 4.0 technologies in the context of lean-agile by way of motivating them on specific pillars of industry 4.0 to adopt for specific lean-agile strategies in achieving overall organizational goals. other managerial and theoretical implications of the work are highlighted.","industry 4.0, lean practice",,ibrahim oluwole raji and tommaso rossi school of industrial engineering liuc - università carlo cattaneo castellanza 21053 (va) italy iraji@liuc.it; trossi@liuc.it,"References

245,"Barriers To Bdpa Applications In Sustainable Hsc Practices  Surajit Bag, Telukdarie Arnesh","big data and predictive analytics (bdpa) research in humanitarian supply chain operations has gained popularity for its ability to manage disaster risks. bdpa approach not only aims to predict future events, but also concentrates on current events and further prepare for the future events. however, review of prior studies shows this area is highly diverse and fragmented. further, bdpa driven approach in hsc operations is complicated due to presence of multiple barriers, whose interrelationships are yet to be documented for purpose of enhancing existing knowledge base. the gaps in existing literature motivated to pursue the current study and aim to identify the leading barriers and further categorize them and finally develop the contextual interrelationships using popular fuzzy total interpretive structural modeling (tism) approach. fuzzy tism is a well expressed mental model interpreting both the nodes (indicating ‘what’) and links (indicating ‘how’ and ‘why’) which serves as the basis for theory building process. the tism model shows that the fifteen barriers have achieved eight levels and decision makers must aim to remove the bottom level barriers for achieving sustainability in humanitarian supply chain operations.",barriers,,"post graduate school of engineering management university of johannesburg auckland park, 2092, south africa surajit.bag@gmail.com, arnesht@uj.ac.za",
246,Allocation Of Natural Gas To Consumption Sectors Through  Differential Price Paths,"reliable energy supply is a vital and crucial role of any country and affects its economic and social development. energy subsidies in many countries, while enhancing welfare levels, cause over-consumption of energy, lead to supply insecurity and environmental effects. energy pricing is a key factor in controlling energy demand on one side, and incentivizing supply, on the other side. this paper develops a mathematical model for natural gas supply and demand system to study how differential pricing of natural gas leads to an optimal allocation of it to various demand sectors. the consumer prices of natural gas in each sector affect the sectors’ demand according to its elasticity to the price. on the supply side, optimal pricings affects providing financial resources for natural gas development and supply. the optimal price path of each sector, which maximizes the net present value of net income, maximizes the net present value of underground resources value at the end of planning horizon, and minimizes co2 emission are proposed using a system dynamics model. the model is applied to a case study. the optimal price paths determine a different allocation of natural gas to demand sectors compared to the business as usual case.","natural gas, pricing, energy policy, supply and demand","Ensuring a reliable energy supply with minimum cost is one of the main priorities of each country, and a prerequisite for economic and social development. Among energy resources, natural gas has the prospects to be one of the most growing energy resources of future and to be replaced with more polluted fuels like coal and oil products due to its lower pollution. In this paper, we presented a system dynamics model to study supply and demand reactions in response to pricing policies for each demand sector. The relationships between price and demand, price and supply, and supply and demand are modeled in a dynamic way. Using simulation optimization methods, the optimum price paths that guarantee supply security, maximize the net annual income, and minimize CO2 emissions are proposed in the model. The model is used to forecast the future natural gas supply and demand in the case study of Iran with more than 60% share of natural gas in the primary energy supply mix. The model forecasted a gap between supply and demand before 2025, if the current pricing policies for domestic sectors continued. It is concluded that the current pricing does not provide enough capital for future investments in natural gas development. According to this forecast, the optimum price paths are determined using various objective functions. These price paths indirectly affect how natural gas should be allocated to various demand sectors optimally. The results for the case study show that the highest increase should be for natural gas allocated to export and the lowest growth is related to the natural gas allocated to the residential sector.","farzaneh daneshzand†, ali elkamel, michael fowlerϯ, and mohammad reza amin- naseriϯϯ department of chemical engineering, khalifa university of science and technology, san campus, p. o. box 2533, abu dhabi, united arab emirates ϯdepartment of chemical engineering, university of waterloo, waterloo, ontario, n2l 3g, canada ϯϯindustrial and systems engineering faculty, tarbiat modares university, tehran, iran fdaneshz@uwaterloo.ca, ali.elkamel@ku.ac.ae, mfowler@uwaterloo.ca, amin_nas@modares.ac.ir",
247,Big Data And Machine Learning Based Approach To Gas  Processing: A Case Of Condensate Stabilization,"gas condensate recovered from the natural gas is a valuable liquid product. it must be processed or treated to a commercially acceptable form for its storage or export. the treatment of gas condensate generally involves the separation of any dissolved gases such as light hydrocarbon components (i.e., methane and ethane) along with decreasing the acid contents (i.e., h2s, mercaptans, etc.), water and salt contents to the desired standards in order to make it environmentally safe for storage and transportation purposes. the process of stripping the light end components from the heavier hydrocarbons is referred as condensate stabilization which is primarily performed to reduce the vapor pressure of condensate liquids to avoid the generation of vapor phase when transferring them to atmospheric tanks. condensate stabilization can be achieved by either flash vaporization or fractionation. however, condensate stabilization by fractionation is a popular choice in industry as it has the capability to produce condensate liquids of desired vapor pressure in a single tower process. it is a complicated chemical process, thus requires significant efforts to develop accurate and reliable models with the objective to minimize the operational costs. lately, the modeling approach that deals with input-output operating data has gained significant attention. machine learning has been emerged as a proven and alternative modeling approach that based on operating data, which is readily available. this work therefore employs artificial neural network (ann) in order to build a model that can predict the performance of the condensate stabilizer unit. a large dataset of an industrial condensate stabilizer, comprising of operating data of input-output variables, is used to evaluate the developed model. to develop the ann model, inlet gas flowrate, inlet gas temperature, column temperature, column pressure, condensate flowrate, condensate temperature, reboiler temperature and steam flowrate are implemented as model inputs, whereas rvp, h2s contents and water contents are used as network outputs. the dataset is split randomly into two subsets for the purpose of training and testing the model. the training subset of data is employed to train the network by developing the network weights whereas the testing subset is used to estimate and compare the output of developed model against the independent operating data. the main objective of developing this ann model is to predict the important parameters of the final stabilized liquid, which are rvp, h2s contents and water contents. the predictions from the developed model are compared with the testing subset of operating data. to evaluate the model performance, mean squared error (mse) and coefficient of determination (r2) are investigated. the results obtained from this case study show that the developed model has the potential to offer reliable and accurate predictions. as future work, an integrated framework will be developed where data-driven surrogate models will be integrated into optimization framework to find the optimal values of the variables corresponding to the minimal operational costs or energy demands. the integrated framework will be able to help the gas industry to simultaneously achieve the process efficiency, profitability and safety.","machine learning, big data, gas processing",,"muhammad rizwan1, mohammed alkatheri2, falah alhameli2, ali elkamel1,2 and ali almansoori1 1department of chemical engineering, khalifa university of science and technology, san campus, p. o. box 2533, abu dhabi, united arab emirates 2department of chemical engineering, university of waterloo, waterloo, ontario, n2l 3g, canada muhammad.rizwan@ku.ac.ae, mohammed.alkatheri@uwaterloo.ca, falhamel@uwaterloo.ca, ali.elkamel@ku.ac.ae, ali.almansoori@ku.ac.ae",
248,Data-Driven Power Generation Design And Operation Under  Demand Uncertainty,"a data-driven stochastic optimization framework that leverages big data in design and operation of power generation units is proposed. a k-means clustering algorithm is adopted to generate uncertainty scenarios for the stochastic optimization framework. in order to do this, the power generating design and operation problem is formulated as a two-stage stochastic programming model. the first stage variables are associated with design decisions, whereas the second stage variables are associated with unit commitment operation (i.e. scheduling). the historical demand data was first collected and reprocessed. after that, the processed electrical demand (uncertain parameter) is processed and recognized using unsupervised machine learning. k-means clustering algorithm is used to produce electrical demand scenario profiles. these scenarios are used as inputs to the stochastic model. the proposed model is formulated as a mixed integer linear programming (milp) and solved using gams. the stochastic data driven method enjoys the following features: it is based on information derived from real data without explicitly knowing the data distribution and it applies the recent advances of data analysis tools (e.g. machine learning) to generate a reduced size data set (i.e. clusters) integrated into mathematical model (i.e. design and planning model) that leads to a computationally tractable problem. 1. introduction deterministic process design and operation models can help ensure an optimal solution for certain process parameters (e.g. demand, fuel price) where it satisfies the constraints associated with that parameter (i.e. product should be greater than or equal to demand). as most real-life problems involve some sort of uncertainty, deterministic models are incapable of resolving them. in reality, most model parameters are uncertain, such as the availability of renewable energy and power demand are not known with certainty and are hard to predict. there exist a considerable number of studies from industry and academia on optimization under uncertainty (sahinidis 2004, grossmann et al. 2016, ierapetritou et al. 1996). however, these approaches do not take advantage of the recent advances in machine learning and big data analytics to leverage uncertainty data for optimization under uncertainty. hence, the goal of this paper is to propose a data- driven stochastic decision-making framework that integrates machine learning methods to uncertainty data with the design and operation of power generation problem. traditional models of decision-making under uncertainty assume perfect information which means either accurate values for the system parameters or specific probability distributions for the random variables. nevertheless, such exact knowledge is rarely available, prior knowledge on uncertain parameter distribution is unknown and fitting random variables (uncertain parameter) into a popular distribution is complicated and impractical (bertsimas and thiele 2006). furthermore, it is mathematically intractable to deal with erroneous inputs (all sets of uncertain data) and this could lead to infeasible solutions or exhibit poor performance when implemented (bertsimas and thiele 2006). therefore, in this paper we propose a data-driven stochastic approach for power generation design and operation optimization that can efficiently utilize the available historical demand data through advances of data analytics tools such as k-means clustering (a machine learning tool) by doing this, data-driven power planning is achieved against uncertainty realization. 345",,,"mohammed alkatheri1, muhammad rizwan2, falah alhameli1, ali elkamel1,2, ali almansoori2, and peter douglas1 1department of chemical engineering, university of waterloo, waterloo, ontario, n2l 3g, canada 2department of chemical engineering, khalifa university of science and technology, san campus, p. o. box 2533, abu dhabi, united arab emirates mohammed.alkatheri@uwaterloo.ca, muhammad.rizwan@ku.ac.ae, falhamel@uwaterloo.ca , ali.elkamel@ku.ac.ae, ali.almansoori@ku.ac.ae, peter.douglas@uwaterloo.ca","References

Conclusion In this paper, the humanitarian supply chain design has been represented in the form of a stochastic optimization model. The proposed model has been applied to specific data and conditions in the northern regions of Tehran. Decision variables of this model include the location of commercial storage centers and distribution centers, and the amounts of allocated commodities from commercial storage centers to distribution centers, and from distribution centers to demand centers. The effect of various scenarios of occurring disasters, the probability of capacity loss in both commercial storage centers and distribution centers and different transportation modes from commercial storage centers to distribution centers and from distribution centers to demand centers on the travel time have been analyzed in this model. 8.2. Future Recommendations Considering pre-disaster phase, perishability of relief commodities (such as drugs), uncertainty in the delivery time of commodity, shortage and the ability to add or remove transportation modes can be considered as the potential future research directions.","parmis emadi and zbigniew j. pasek department of industrial engineering university of windsor 401 sunset ave, windsor, on emadi@uwindsor.ca, zjpasek@uwindsor.ca",
