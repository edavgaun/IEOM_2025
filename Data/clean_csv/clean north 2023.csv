0,A New Formulation Of Quadratic Assignment Problem  (Qap),"different formulations of qap (such as linear integer formulation, milp formulation, formulation by permutations, trace formulation and graph formulation) are given in loiola et. al. (2007). different linearization of qap are summarized in singh and sharma (2008). we give here a new qap formulation and describe its advantages. for many different contributions to layout problems refer to sharma (2019, 2019, 2020, 2020, 2021 and 2022). in this paper we give a new formulation of qap. problem qap min sum over (i,j,k,l): x(i,j)*x(k,l)*d(j,l)*f(i,k) (a) sum(i), x(i,j) = 1 for all j (b) sum(j), x(i,j) = 1 for all i (c) x(i,j) = (0,1) for all i and j (d) x(i,j) = 1 if facility ‘i’ gets into ‘j’ th slot, d(j,l) is the distance between ‘j’ th and ‘l’ th slot and f(i,k) is flow between facility ‘i’ and ‘k’. here we give a new formulation of qap. we put following constraints. x(i,j) + m*(1 – y(i,j)) >= 1 for all i,j (e) x(i,j) - m*(y(i,j)) <= 0 for all i,j (f) y(i,j) = (0,1) for all i,j (g) and add (h) in place of (d) x(i,j) >= 0 for all i,j (h) when x(i,j) is 1, then y(i,j) = 1; and when x(i,j) is 0, then y(i,j) is 0. any x(i,j) in open interval (0,1) is infeasible (say x(i,j) = 0.5 is infeasible with either y(i,j) = 0 or 1). thus though x(i,j) is real >= 0, it acts like binary due to (e), (f) and (g). then new formulation (nf_qap) of qap is (a), s.t. (b), (c), (e), (f), (g) and (h). it has n2 real, n2 binary and 2*( n2 +n) constraints; and has quadratic objective function in real variables. these are the merits of our new formulation of qap. for a detailed comparison see singh and sharma (2008). similar formulations are possible in dplp (dynamic plant layout problem) also.",,,rrk sharma department of ime iit kanpur 208016 india rrks@iitk.ac.in,"References

1,Proposing A New Promising Constraint To The Single Stage  Capacitated Warehouse Location Problem (Sscwlp),"in this work, we advance the solution approach to the single stage capacitated warehouse location problem (sscwlp) problem. we took six formulations given by sharma and berry (2007) for sscwlp with various constraints combinations and added a new promising constraint (∑capj * yj ≥ 1). the computations done after additional constraint results in statistically better results reduction in number of nodes searched as well as in cpu time taken to solve the problem. we created random 50 samples of problems of size 15x15x15, 30x30x30 and 50x50x50 size problems and solved using gams software to show the computational advantage even in such large magnitude problem. we performed paired t-test on all the six pairs of results to observe statistical significance of improvement with the new constraint. results with new constraint were observed statistically significant and better at two-tailed t- test with 95% confidence interval.",,"In this work, we add one new promising constraint in the various formulations proposed in the style of Sharma and Sharma in the quest of finding the strength and computational benefit of the new constraint added. All formulations were solved on GAMS with Branch and Bound algorithm. After performing the statistical analysis it can clearly be established that the formulations having the new added constraint (∑capj.yj≥1) take less no of node searched also can be executed in lesser computational time as compare to their counterpart formulations, not having this constraint. This was statistically evident in both small as well as large size of problems taken. However, we couldn’t go beyond 50X50X50 size problem because of the termination of program run on the GAMS due to low processing capacity of the system but the strength of this constraint can further be checked on problems having size of 100X100X100 and beyond. In whole of the analysis, we considered single commodity problem but this work can be extended to multi commodity problems as well.","rrk sharma department of ime, iit kanpur 208016 india email: rrks@iitk.ac.in ajay jha department of operations management jaipuria institute of management, lucknow, 226010 india email: ajayjha.knp@gmail.com priyank dubey kanpur divisional office indian oil corporation ltd, kanpur 208001 india email: rehanr94@gmail.com kk lai president, cyut taiwan laikk.tw@gmail.com",
2,Impact Of Workload Balancing On The Sustainability Of  Processes In A Manufacturing Company,"nowadays, manufacturing companies are looking to improve their sustainability in the market. however, there are several factors that negatively affect it, such as workload imbalance among workers, defective parts, and customer complaints, to name a few. this paper presents a case study of a workload imbalance in a global customer complaint follow-up process in a manufacturing company, generating lagged complaints (no follow-up), which has negatively impacted the sustainability of the process. due to this, the objective of this project is to increase the sustainability of the process by reducing the number of delayed complaints. to do this, the causes of the problem are identified. then, an analysis of the process flow map is performed to see the current distribution of the workload among the different plants of the company. moreover, corrective actions are implemented and followed up. subsequently, the process is standardized, transferred by parts to the different plants, monitored for control, and the effectiveness of the actions is measured. as a result, there was an increasing trend in terms of compliance in the capture of complaints, starting with 84% and reaching 97%. similarly, the total number of complaints received showed a decreasing trend. finally, zero delayed/indefinite complaints (no follow-up) were obtained. therefore, it is concluded that workload balancing has a positive impact on the sustainability of processes in manufacturing companies.","delayed complaints, social",,"arturo realyvásquez-vargas, perla maría larrañaga, karina cecilia arredondo-soto, guadalupe hernández-escobedo, amalia carmina salinas-hernández department of industrial engineering tecnológico nacional de méxico/instituto tecnológico de tijuana tijuana, baja california, mexico arturo.realyvazquez@tectijuana.edu.mx, perla.larranagam201@tectijuana.edu.mx, karina.arredondo@tectijuana.edu.mx, guadalupe.hernandez@tectijuana.edu.mx, asalinas@tectijuana.edu.mx","References

3,A New Approach For Solving Simple Plant Location  Problem (Splp),"the simple plant location problem (splp), an np-hard combinatorial problem, is used extensively to decide the minimum number of plants with unlimited production capacity to serve a certain set of markets demand. the objective function is to minimize the sum of fixed costs of locating the plants and variable cost of transportation of moving goods from plants to markets. strong formulation of splp gives better bounds than weak formulations of splp. hence in a branch and bound method, we find that strong formulation processes lesser number of nodes. but the number of strong constraints are quadratic (number of weak constraints are linear); hence at each node we take more time to process the node (sharma and verma (2012)) and weak formulation does better in terms of cpu time to give optimal solution. we add few most promising constraints to weak formulations and see that weak + few promising strong constraint formulation of splp performs the best.","np hard, valid inequality","After analysing the above discussion and tables we can conclude that the model B1 is the best model among models A1, A2, A3, B1 and B3. . Model B2 is as good as B1. So the contribution in form of most promising constraints holds good in solving SPLP.","r.r.k. sharma industrial & management engineering iit kanpur, india rrks@iitk.ac.in ajay jha jaipuria institute of management, lucknow, india ajay.jha@jaipuria.ac.in abhay pratap singh industrial & management engineering iit kanpur, u.p., india abhayraj03560@gmail.com",

7,Learning-Curve Applications For Emerging Products And  Services,"a learning curve is a powerful tool for companies producing large lots or cutting-edge products, enabling them to negotiate cost savings. new products and services are crucial for the growth of any business, particularly in the technology sector. however, they also come with inherent risks. one of these challenges is the learning curve associated with new offerings. companies can assess the cost savings of acquiring new skills by applying the learning curve. a common mistake is to price new products solely based on their initial manufacturing costs. however, if businesses utilize the learning curve effectively, it can be a valuable tool for estimating costs, improving productivity, and achieving long-term profitability. understanding and implementing the learning curve empowers companies to make informed pricing, resource allocation, and project management decisions. it allows them to optimize their processes and identify opportunities for cost reduction and improved performance. the study aims to determine the learning rate for emerging or exceptionally large-scale products where traditional learning curve theory may not readily apply. this research will show how large corporations and defense organizations can effectively use the learning curve to manage extensive projects involving emerging products and services.","learning curve, learning rate","The proposed model will improve the perception of the learning curve as the Effect of learning efficiency, cognitive learning, and productivity, as most people usually get better at repeated processes. The learning-Curve Effect as a negotiation tool requires careful analysis of data and a clear understanding of the efficiencies gained over time. By highlighting experience, a company can negotiate based on efficiency gains and negotiate better deals and agreements. Continued improvement could be used as a negotiation tool to estimate the project cost. This example illustrates how the learning curve effect can be applied to calculate the cost of producing the next product unit based on the cumulative production volume. The provided tables show an example of shipbuilding data and the results of the learning curve model. The R-squared value of 0.9 indicates a strong relationship between the hours and the shipping number, demonstrating the learning curve effect. The estimated parameter b, obtained from the linear regression, represents the learning rate. In this case, the expected learning rate falls within the typical range for shipbuilding projects (around 88.4%). A human phenomenon is that an employee gets quickly in performing repetitive tasks and becomes proficient over time. The study showed that the learning curve could be used to predict the cost of production during large-scale production. This information was helpful to the company in making decisions about how to develop and launch large- scale emerging products such as a new containership or super tanker. A high learning curve indicates that the initial cost is high, but the tasks might be intensive to employee training. As the learning curve has many applications, a company can identify the significance of dedicated training for new procedures, allocating employees' time, or allocating costs across a new product or an extensive unit and use the information for negotiation. Future research direction is how a project manager or industry leader can use various learning curve applications to derive financial forecasts, estimate the budget, anticipate due dates, and meet customer demand.","mohammad rahman and daniel kirby school of engineering, science, and technology central connecticut state university new britain, ct 06053, usa rahman@ccsu.edu, kirbyerd@ccsu.edu",
8,The Risk Management For Infant Formula Milk Supply  Chain Based On Ahp Model For Risk Mitigation And,"the first product in a baby's diet that makes a difference in their health is infant milk. infant formula milk (ifm) has experienced many turbulences throughout history and has always been a target for smugglers and those attempting to make illegal high profits. the biggest scandal in chinese ifm trading occurred in 2008, and the recent massive recall of ifm products in the us in february 2022 following the recognition that the products contained microbial contamination. among the bacteria found are salmonella newport and cronobacter sakazakii. throughout this study, the objective is to identify the most critical risks that may affect the quality of ifm in the supply chain and determine mitigation strategies to improve the performance measurement of ifm in the supply chain. we are developing a model to reduce adulteration and contamination rates in the ifmsc and maximize safety. the steps to achieve the study objectives include: 1) identifying the importance of ifms for infant nutrition and their risks. 2) establishing mitigation criteria for evaluating the performance of the ifmsc to maximize its quality; and 3) analyzing each mitigation criteria to maximize the safety of ifms. based on pairwise comparisons conducted by professionals in food supply chain (fsc) decision-making, the analytic hierarchy process (ahp) model is used to analyze and prioritize mitigation alternatives. according to the contamination quality risk agent, the mitigation alternative (qr.m2) ranks highest. it illustrates how important it is to avoid risk when dealing with public health, especially the health of infants, and how ifm must undergo precise testing and quality checks at every stage of the supply chain to ensure its quality.","infant formula milk, milk quality, supply chain risks",,"maximize the safety mona haji logistics and supply chain management department college of science and engineering hamad bin khalifa university doha, qatar mhaji@hbku.edu.qa",

14,The Impact Of Working Capital Management On Future  Profitability In Japanese Companies,"working capital management is a very important element of financial management because many firms require large amounts of cash for working capital and hold large amounts of short-term debt as a source of financing. the cash conversion cycle is the time lag between the expenditure for the purchases of raw materials and the collection of sales of finished goods. it can be obtained by adding the number of days inventories to number of days accounts receivable and subtracting number of days accounts payable. what is the relationship between working capital management and profitability? in other words, does the profitability of a firm increase the more efficiently it manages its working capital? one of the factors that may affect the profitability of working capital management is that working capital management is efficient when inventories are sold quickly, leaving the firm with a large amount of cash. in such a situation, the company can use the cash to purchase and sell more profitable products and services. studies that have demonstrated whether ccc and its components increase profitability have found that ccc has a negative impact on profitability. however, the results are not consistent, with half of the previous studies showing a positive impact of number of days accounts payable on profitability and the other half showing a negative impact. in addition, with the exception of one study, the validity of the results in other previous studies remains problematic due to small sample sizes. furthermore, previous studies have examined the relationship between ccc and profitability in the same period, and it is not clear which is the result, and which is the cause. the purpose of this study is to determine how firms' working capital management affects their profitability. specifically, we examine the relationship between working capital management in period t and profitability in period t+1 using data from 20,236 (firms/year) firms listed on the tokyo stock exchange. regression analysis of working capital management in period t and profitability in period t+1 shows that ccc, number of days accounts receivable, and number of days inventories are statistically significant for profitability in period t+1. however, number of days accounts payable is not statistically significant. therefore, in order to shorten ccc and increase profitability, it is better to shorten number of days inventories and number of days accounts receivable.",,,"koshiro shiba, ayuko komura, and hirohisa hirai department of industrial engineering and management kanagawa university kanagawa, japan r201903844iu@jindai.jp, komura-a@kanagawa-u.ac.jp, hirai@kanagawa-u.ac.jp",
15,Building A Model For The Detection Of Fraudulent  Accounting Using Textual Information From The Md&A,"accounting fraud is defined as ""the intentional material misstatement of financial statements or financial disclosures (in notes to the financial statements or sec filings) or the perpetration of an illegal act that has a material direct effect on the financial statements or financial disclosures"". detecting accounting fraud at an early stage is important, because fraudulent activity reduces public reliability in capital markets and hinders economic development. therefore, studies have been conducted to establish a model for the detection of accounting fraud using quantitative data, such as accounting and financial information, and qualitative data, which are descriptions in security reports, such as form 10-k. previous studies employed quantitative data to develop a fraudulent accounting detection model using logistic regression, with factors affecting the occurrence of accounting fraud as variables. in contrast, one study used random forest (rf) to create a list of words with high predictive power in association with accounting fraud (e.g. a list of words related to merger activity or legal issues). these words were used as input variables to build a fraud detection model using a support vector machine (svm). previous studies have confirmed that text data are an effective indicator in the construction of fraudulent accounting detection models. however, to the best of our knowledge, no accounting fraud detection model using text analysis exists in the context of japanese companies. therefore, the objective of this study was to construct a fraudulent accounting detection model using textual analysis for descriptions in the md&a section of japanese companies' annual securities reports. following the procedure of previous studies, a fraudulent accounting detection model using rf and svm was constructed for companies listed on the tokyo stock exchange from 2011 to 2017. firstly, rf was used to determine the rank order of words that can effectively discriminate between fraudulent and non-fraudulent accounting firms. next, based on the top 200 words, svm was used to estimate fraudulent and non-fraudulent accounting companies. accounting fraud and non-fraud firms were also estimated using rf as a baseline model. our study indicates that the estimation results using svm had a geometric mean (the geometric mean of the true positive and true negative rates) of 74.29% and a sensitivity (the accuracy of the accounting fraud firms) of 64.58%, showing a higher accuracy than the results obtained when using rf.","accounting fraud, textual analysis",,"section of japanese companies keisuke miyago, natsuki sato, ayuko komura, and hirohisa hirai department of industrial engineering and management kanagawa university kanagawa, japan r201903815ya@jindai.jp, r202170129yo@jindai.jp, komura-a@kanagawa-u.ac.jp, hirai@kanagawa-u.ac.jp",
16,A Comparison Of Students' Learning Experience In  Undergraduate Engineering Programs Using Face-To-Face,"the availability of high-speed internet systems and more advanced digital mediums provided better opportunities for transforming knowledge and aiding teaching and learning over the past decade. academic institutions have been encouraging and incentivizing their faculty to collaborate with the technical staff to utilize digital technology in the classrooms and to report and present their challenges. with the arrival of the covid pandemic in early 2020, institutions rushed to use digital mediums to transform their delivery methods from face-to-face or in-person to synchronous or asynchronous, depending on the institution's readiness. texas a&m university and one of its two satellite campuses in qatar adopted the same policy. texas a&m university is one of the few universities successfully establishing an international campus. the qatar campus started its operation in the fall of 2002. since its inception, the campus has offered four abet-accredited engineering programs in chemical, electrical, mechanical, and petroleum engineering, and by may 2022, over 1,300 received engineering degrees. the campus has consistently been well regarded for its innovative approaches to teaching and learning methods in the middle east and north africa (mena region). this article presents the results of an empirical study conducted at texas a&m university in qatar and texas a&m university in college station, texas, in two undergraduate courses taught on these two campuses. this study also compared students' participation and academic performance during remote in-class (synchronous) and face-to-face learning.",delivery methods,"There were some commonalities in the comments given by undergraduate students from the two institutions. The ability to use information technology (IT) effectively is essential for synchronous learning. High-speed internet accessibility had an impact on how students interacted with their peers and participated in class. However, because neither the academic institution nor the course instructors had any influence over the network's uploading or downloading speed, no questions about this issue were included in the questionnaire. It is also important to note that theoretical classes were favored to have access to course instructors and receive face-to-face training because these methods might hasten the learning process. The survey results also revealed that students in classes that included laboratory components were less supportive of synchronous remote learning.

21,The Development Of A Dual-Channel Warehouse And  Inventory Management Model With Stochastic Demand And,"every industry is competing, especially retail, to transition or increase its sales channels not only through physical stores, but also through online channels. likewise, warehouses are required to be able to participate in the order fulfillment process both through stores and online. this research develops an inventory model for dual channel warehouses with limited warehouse space and product returns. with the warehouse divided into two parts, namely for offline order fulfillment and for online order fulfillment. the development of this model also considers demand uncertainty and delivery lead time. the warehouse space constraint is convex nonlinear programming and uses karush-kuhn-tucker analysis in solving it. a closed-form solution was developed using normal distribution in the case of no limited warehouse space constraints, and an iterative algorithm using bisection method for the case with limited warehouse space constraints. numerical analysis was conducted directly on a warehouse in a sports retail company to get a real-world view of the proposed model. the results show that warehouse space greatly affects the size of the order quantity. the sensitivity analysis conducted also shows that the proposed model offers an optimal solution for the size of the order quantity and reorder point and can also minimize the total warehouse cost.","uncertain demand, product returns","and Future Research This research has developed a model to determine the number of orders and reorder points for dual-channel warehouses, namely offline and online. The model was developed based on Alawneh and Zhang’s (2018) dual-channel warehouse inventory model by applying the warehouse capacity. The development of the model lies in the presence of offline and online product returns and eliminates backorder costs because it does not fit the situation in sports retail companies. The developed model considers the fulfillment of storage on offline and online shelves or channels, warehouse capacity, order costs, storage costs, and product return costs. It also considers the minimum total warehouse cost. The model also considers demand uncertainty and delivery lead-time. A closed-form solution is developed using the normal distribution in the absence of limited warehouse capacity constraints and an iterative algorithm using the bisection method for cases with limited warehouse capacity constraints. The products used as research objects were products in class A, with 562 items in the warehouse. Under the condition of a normally distributed demand and deterministic lead time, a lower total warehouse cost of Rp. 2,249,728,439.03 is obtained when compared to when the demand conditions are normally distributed with stochastic lead time or uncertainty, namely Rp. 3,185,060,398.47. Under the conditions of normal distributed demand and deterministic lead time, for class A items, the total number of order sizes (Q) on offline channels is 107,582 pcs with a reorder point (R) of 98,604 pcs. On the online channel, there are 21,904 pcs for the total number of order sizes (Q) and 1,510 pcs for the reorder point (R). Meanwhile, under conditions of normally distributed demand and stochastic lead time, for class A items, the total number of order sizes (Q) on the offline channel is 107,582 pcs with a reorder point (R) of 188,954 pcs. On the online channel, 21,904 pcs for the total number of order sizes (Q) and 1,510 pcs for the reorder point (R). The results of the calculation of all class A items for normally distributed demand with deterministic or stochastic lead times did not exceed the capacity of the warehouse provided. In addition to determining the optimal inventory policy for a dual-channel warehouse, the sensitivity analysis also shows that the proposed model offers an optimal solution and provides a tool for decision support for companies operating in the context of dual-channel warehouses. Future research could develop models using conditions that do not have historical sales, can compare the results between single- and dual-channel accompanied by an analysis from an economic point of view, so that it can be a more accurate input to help companies make decisions and can add other constraints, such as limited warehouse capacity, the cost of returning goods, backorder transportation, or even a dual- channel warehouse that is sustainable and environmentally friendly.","return products in sports retailer multazam bagus harto, dendi p. ishak industrial engineering department, faculty of engineering university of indonesia depok, jawa barat, indonesia multazam.bagus@ui.ac.id, dendi@ie.ui.ac.id",
22,The Impact Of The Information Of Management Forecast  Achievement On Japanese Investors' Decision-Making,"a company announces financial results to investors and analysts and discloses information on the status of its operating results and financial performance. therefore, announcements of financial results are important for investors and analysts in making investment decisions. in the financial results announcement, the company reports its performance for the current period (including the details of performance and the financial situation during the period) and announces the earnings forecast by the company's management (referred to as the management forecast). management forecasts are particularly important for investors' decision-making because they are published by managers who hold inside information. a previous study tested the counting heuristic in an experimental study of mba students. the counting heuristic is the theory that investors make investment decisions based on the number of times analyst eps estimates are achieved, rather than on earnings surprises. the performance surprise is the difference between the actual eps and the analysts’ forecast eps. their results showed that the number of times analysts achieved eps estimates had a strong influence on investors' decisions. the purpose of this study is to clarify how information on earnings surprises and the number of times management- forecast eps are achieved affects investors' investment decisions when analyst forecast eps is changed to management-forecast eps. we hypothesize that given information on earnings surprises and the number of times management forecasts are achieved, investors will give more weight to information on the number of times management forecasts are achieved compared to earnings surprises in assessing (a) the common stock valuation of the firm, (b) the desirability of the firm (as an investment), (c) the future prospects of the firm, (d) the competence of management, and (e) trustworthiness of management. an internet experiment was then conducted with japanese investors. first, the hypotheses were partially supported by the results on stock evaluation and managerial competence, as the results tended to focus on the number of times management forecasts were achieved rather than performance surprises. the results on corporate desirability and future prospects showed equal importance in the number of achievements and performance surprises. these results did not support the hypotheses. finally, the reliability results showed that the number of times management forecasts were achieved was more important than performance surprises, and the hypothesis was supported. therefore, it is important for firms to achieve management-forecast eps to increase their common stock valuation, management competence, and trustworthiness. it is also important for firms to focus on achieving and significantly exceeding management forecasts to increase the desirability of the firm as an investment and the future prospects of each firm.",experimental study,,"kaori ojima, ayuko komura, and hirohisa hirai department of industrial engineering and management kanagawa university kanagawa, japan r201903786ze@jindai.jp, komura-a@kanagawa-u.ac.jp, hirai@kanagawa-u.ac.jp",
23,The Impact Of The Explanatory Variable Patterns And  Learning Techniques Used On The Real Estate Price,"hedonic methods have been widely used in real estate price estimation. however, hedonic methods use multiple regression analysis, which makes it difficult to consider many of the complex motivations and preferences that shape real estate prices due to multicollinearity. neural networks (nns) have attracted considerable attention in recent years as an analytical method that compensates for the shortcomings of hedonic methods. an advantage of the proposed approach is that, by using nns, there is no need to assume explicit functions between the input and output of the studies, because the nn learns directly from the observed data. as research on the nn methodology in real estate price estimation has progressed, many studies have compared the accuracy of hedonic methods with nn. one of the representative studies compared the accuracy of hedonic methods and neural network models for estimating house prices in turkey and showed that nn can be a better alternative to hedonic methods. however, there are some problems with the study of real estate price estimations using nns. first, the choice of explanatory variables for the model has not been examined sufficiently. previous studies often employ only micro variables as explanatory variables in their models, and few studies employ macro variables in their models, even though macro variables such as gdp have a significant impact on the formation of real estate prices. previous studies constructed neural network models with microdata and environmental factors (macro variables) such as air pollution as explanatory variables. as a result, they reported that a model incorporating macro-variables related to the environment was more accurate. current studies on real estate price estimation using nns in japan often consider only micro variables. therefore, this study aims to clarify the impact of the explanatory variable patterns used in the model by comparing two variable patterns: one in which only micro variables are used as explanatory variables, and the other in which both micro and macro variables are used. we also identify which of the three methods (hedonic methods, nn, and deep neural network (dnn)) is best suited for these two cases. the results show that models with both micro and macro variables as explanatory variables are more accurate than the ones with only micro variables. the results also show that using a dnn is more accurate than using hedonic methods or an nn. however, the method used should be considered on a case-by-case basis, as nn may be more accurate in cases with only micro variables as explanatory variables.","hedonic methods, neural network",,"estimation models in japan tsubasa isogai, ayuko komura and hirohisa hirai department of industrial engineering and management kanagawa university kanagawa, japan r201903778hy@jindai.jp, komura-a@kanagawa-u.ac.jp, hirai@kanagawa-u.ac.jp",
24,Determining Optimum Maintenance Interval Of Critical  Equipment In Geothermal Power Plant Based On Reliability,"geothermal industry unit capital cost and electricity tariff has been competing with lower-cost power generators. this situation has challenged all people that work for the industry to optimize their plant reliability, increase revenue, and reduce cost. maintenance activities can be considered a critical process which can be very costly if those activities are not managed properly. part of maintenance management is to determine the optimal maintenance interval with the lowest maintenance cost. this paper determines the optimal maintenance interval of the most critical subsystem in a big-scale geothermal generation facility in indonesia. the most critical subsystem of the facility is chosen based on reliability value. one of the tools chosen in the industry as a framework for evaluating system reliability is reliability block diagram (rbd). based on rbd, the most critical sub-system is the cooling tower structure system which consists of two equipment, the cooling tower fan, and the cooling tower structure. the optimum maintenance of the cooling tower fan was calculated using the total cost model equation. sensitivity analysis is also carried out in this paper to determine the cost ratio at which maintenance cost and failure cost calculations must be calculated in detail. to obtain optimum maintenance intervals with a certain confidence interval value, the data resampling with the bootstrap method is applied to the equipment failure data due to the limited amount of data. the difference in maintenance interval value between the original data and the bootstrapped data is relatively small with a maximum of 5.1% difference.",,"With this research, it is possible to select the critical subsystem and equipment based on its reliability value and the target value of the reliability of the whole system. This research provides an alternative on how to determine the optimum maintenance interval and provides a method for determining the maintenance interval in a certain range with a predetermined confidence interval. One of the critical equipment in the geothermal power plant is Cooling Tower Fan. The Cooling Tower Fan has an optimum maintenance interval is 412 days with a cost ratio of 6.896. Based on bootstrap data resampling, the range of optimum maintenance interval is 391-410 days with a 95% of confidence interval. As a continuation of this research, future studies about the different resampling methods, higher confidence interval of data resampling, combination with the condition monitoring and inspection interval and total cost of all maintenance strategies (Predictive, Preventive, and Corrective), will make essential contributions to the maintenance and reliability organizations. 7.","value and cost ratio diva erenst nataprawira and zulkarnain department of industrial engineering universitas indonesia, jawa barat, indonesia",

31,Developing And Validating Mathematical Model For  Electricity System Transition Planning,"the transition from marginal to dominant renewable energy systems in electricity generation globally has posed new challenges in terms of intermittency, variability, uncertainty and low-reliability. this situation has led to a significant supply-demand gap in terms of temporal mismatch (times of supply and demand) and quantity mismatch (high supply with low demand, and vice versa). these mismatches lead to several issues, including surplus or insufficient electricity generation, erratic grid operation, etc. hence, the electricity planners have to match “dynamic supply with dynamic demand.”. in managing such a transitioning electricity system, the planning from the electricity supply side requires efficient management of existing electric power systems, on rationalizing generation portfolios. therefore, to address these decisions, we have developed a generic linear programming-based optimisation model that dynamically balances supply and demand at least cost. in addition to achieving this objective of dynamic supply-demand balance, the model is designed to evaluate all the supply-side options and arrive at a least-cost generation portfolio. this would enable an re dominated electricity taking in to account the inherent challenges associated with renewable energy integration. the model is validated using data from the electricity system of karnataka, india where actual data was compared to modelled outputs for the calendar year 2019. precision metrics, which measures standard error, were used to assess the model's accuracy. the results indicated that the standard error ranged from ±10%, which is within acceptable limits. this model can be effectively used for electricity transition planning and can provide critical inputs to policy makers.",,,"varun jyothiprakash, p balachandra and abhishek das department of management studies indian institute of science bengaluru -560012 varunj@iisc.ac.in, patilb@iisc.ac.in, abhishekdas1@iisc.ac.in samridh sharma inter-disciplinary centre for energy research, indian institute of science bengaluru– 560012 samridhs@iisc.ac.in",

From this dimension met, even in isolated processes, the Manufacturing dimension (Production and Operations), with all technological maturity items, can be implemented. Both are the main dimensions in this industry. Of course, the Strategy dimension must be considered, once that it will take some time for all these technologies to become truly accessible. But the steel industry can prioritize critical, since high value to deploy all services can be a barrier of I4.0. Other dimensions could be applied but not I this time, because its dimension are related with suppliers or customers and, how this kind of industry is very big, involving many suppliers and customers, it is hard to have whole supply chain with I4.0 implemented. This work shows that the assessment models can be applied in steel industry, since to evaluate the stage of I4.0 implementation as to have the role to guide this implementation. The dimensions have to be defined in correct way as well as maturity levels. It is worth mentioning that the proposal presented represents an initial investigation of maturity assessment models for the implementation of I4.0 and its applicability in the steel industry. Finally, recommendations for future work basically consist of: promoting more detailed modelling studies and proposing a model structure more suitable for the industry segment proposed here for study.","4.0 readiness alexandre pimentel sampaio phd program of department of economics, management, industrial engineering and tourism, university of aveiro aveiro, portugal ap.sampaio@ua.pt ana maria pinto de moura govcopp, university of aveiro aveiro, portugal ana.moura@ua.pt ricardo henriques leal director of innovation agency (agir) university of federal fluminense (uff) niterói, brazil rhleal@id.uff.br",
37,Happy Campus: How To Make Universities A Better  Place To Work And Study In India,"campus can be stressful. the transition away from home, the financial and academic pressure, conflicts with peers, and post-graduation planning can all contribute to stress among college students. when managing an increase in responsibilities and changes, many students might forget to contribute intentionally to their own self-care and well-being. health and happiness go hand in hand. since the body and mind are so connected, taking care of physical health is helpful for mental health. making intentional healthy changes to our lifestyle can boost our wellness in meaningful ways. good friends bring fun in the good times and support in the bad times. they share in your joys, celebrations, hardships, and sorrows, and help keep your happiness quotient and spirits high. having meaningful connections with others significantly reduces stress, boosts self-confidence and a sense of belonging, and can even improve the immune system and physical health. friends see, understand, and accept us for who we are. college is a time of immense personal growth. it’s also a time where you can make genuine best friends. we all know that the obligations that come with being a college student can be difficult, so it’s good to have a helping hand when you’re dealing with that exhausting research paper or are having a bad day. we all need someone to lean on from time to time. and, students who make an effort to form relationships in college are more likely to succeed academically and graduate on time. this paper highlights what makes a campus a happy campus and what the universities and higher education institutes should do to make it a better place to study and work.","happy campus, university, india 292",,"dr. g p dinesh, professor, vsk university, ballari and dr. divyabharathi, associate professor bitm, ballari",
38,Data Driven Worker Routing For Irrigation Monitoring  Sara Masoud,"survival and thrift in a globally competitive market strongly depend on the improvement of production quality while monitoring the pricing for grafting nurseries. real-time monitoring of irrigation quality is a necessary yet cumbersome task for propagation facilities. even for indoor facilities with automatic irrigation systems, this task remains bothersome due to the large greenhouses. the main goal of this paper is to propose an irrigation monitoring system to increase production productivity by minimizing the time workers spend on responding to irrigation monitoring calls. here, a two-stage data-driven approach is proposed, where the traveling salesman model is implied on a reduced spatiotemporal network provided by bayesian analysis to optimize workers routing for irrigation monitoring. the proposed approach is the final piece of a dynamic data-driven simulation-based optimization framework. the results over synthetic data demonstrate a potential reduction of 11.60% in traveled distance per worker per call.","traveling salesman, bayesian modeling",,"assistant professor industrial and systems engineering wayne state university detroit, michigan, 48201, usa saramasoud@wayne.edu young-jun son james j. solberg head and ransburg professor industrial engineering purdue university west lafayette, in 47907, usa yjson@purdue.edu","References

39,Airport Electricity Consumption Demand Forecasting  Model Using Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated,"electric load forecasting, also known as probabilistic load forecasting (plf), has played a role in the electric power industry. forecasting the electricity consumption in business is necessary for planning power system operations, stability, and energy trading. many business entities, such as commercial airports, require electric load forecasting to meet service and regulatory needs. therefore, forecasting is needed to become a reference in determining strategic management energy. this research aims to forecast the electricity consumption of soekarno-hatta international airport using the seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (sarima) model. the study uses daily historical data collected from airport operator companies from 01 january 2022 to 31 december 2022 to build and evaluate the model's performance. the findings show that the sarima model (1,1,1)(0,1,1)7 has the best model accuracy with a mape of 4.62%. the study conclusions highlight the potential of the model to support energy management practices at soekarno hatta international airport and other similar facilities.","forecasting, airport, sarima, electricity demand","This research introduces an ARIMA model that including the seasonal patterns of the time series called Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA). The model was applied to analyze the daily electrical consumption data of Soekarno Hatta International Airport (CGK), a seasonal SARIMA (1, 1, 1) (0, 1, 1)7 model is built with MAPE 4.62%. The findings demonstrate that the proposed model exhibited a good fit to the data, effectively capturing the stochastic seasonal fluctuations with the exception of a few extreme values. The predictions derived from this model suggest a gradual increase in electricity consumption for the upcoming month, aligning with the observed weekly seasonal patterns. This changing trend could be a recommendation for airport management to make proper energy and financial management strategies in response to electricity demand.","moving average afwan heru cahya and zulkarnain industrial engineering department, faculty of engineering university of indonesia, depok, west java, indonesia afwan.heru@ui.ac.id, zulkarnain17@ui.ac.id",
40,Production Quality Improvement Of Duplex Carton  Packaging For Aa Products Using The Six Sigma And Seven,"to survive in today's increasingly stringent manufacturing market, every business must strengthen its production quality control. pt. phi is a manufacturer specialized in offset printing and packaging, and one of its products is the duplex cardboard aa duplex carton packaging. the objective of this study was to reduce the occurrence of the most frequently recurring types of defect and improve production quality using the six-sigma method through the dmaic stages (define, measure, analyze, improve, and control) and in the improve stage using multiple tools from the seven new quality tools method to recommend improvement proposals. based on the outcomes of data analysis and processing, the three most common forms of defect are 58.9% unclean ink, 17.3% pond tilt, and 12.6% spot faults. the calculation yielded cp values of 0.84, cpk values of 0.60, dpmo values of 5861.14, and sigma level values of 4.02. after doing fmea analysis and implementing seven new quality tools, it was determined that the biggest causal variables for each type of defect were associated with subpar production machine parts. the recommended changes are routine maintenance of industrial machinery, increased monitoring of production, and enhancements to standard operating procedures.","quality control, six sigma, defect","After conducting research and processing data, several conclusions can be drawn, including the fact that, based on observations, there are six categories of defects, with unclean ink accounting for 58.9%, pond tilting accounting for 17.3%, and freckle defects accounting for 12.6%. Process capability calculations determined that production control was inadequate, with a DPMO value of 5861 units and a sigma level of 4.02. The results of the analyze phase indicate that there are primary factors, with the most common defect problems being associated with suboptimal production machine tools. On the basis of the results of the improve stage analysis using the seven new quality tools method, it can be concluded that the proposal to increase the production quality of duplex cardboard packaging for AA products is based on priority levels, namely the ability to create SOPs for quality inspection of pond knives, preventive maintenance check sheets, SOPs and checklists for incoming material quality, and product quality reports, and also implement quality report meeting.","new quality tools methods mohammad agung saryatmo; helena juliana kristina and raditya pradana putra department of industrial engineering universitas tarumanagara jakarta, indonesia mohammads@ft.untar.ac.id; julianak@ft.untar.ac.id; raditya.545190058@stu.untar.ac.id",
41,A Hybrid Nsga-Ii Approach To Solve A Bi-Objective Multiperiod Assembly Inventory Routing Problem,"this study develops and solves a bi-objective optimization model for an inbound assembly inventory routing problem (irp), considering carbon emission control, stochastic supply failure risks, and uncertainty in customer demand. an assembly plant needs three different components to assemble a product based on a particular bill of materials (bom). these components are outsourced from various geographically dispersed suppliers. a depot provides light, medium, and heavy-duty vehicles to pick up product components from these suppliers during a particular period. the first objective function of the mixed-integer nonlinear model is to minimize the total irp network cost. the second objective function is to reduce the total carbon emission. the model also considers constraints to achieve a minimum service level in each period and avert purchasing from high-risk suppliers. the best near-optimal pareto fronts of problem instances are obtained using a hybrid non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-ii (hnsga-ii). the best near- optimal pareto solution is determined using multi-criteria decision-making (mcdm) techniques. the impacts of different vehicle fleet types on the inbound irp network's performance are also investigated. finally, the sensitivities of important time-varying parameters are reported using a full factorial-designed experiment, and several insights and recommendations are provided.",heterogenous fleet,"In this study, a bi-objective inbound IRP model was formulated considering stochastic supply failure risks, carbon emission control, product assembly, uncertainty in customer demand, and a minimum service level constraint. The model was solved using a HNSGA-II. Moreover, the impacts of different vehicle fleet types on the inbound IRP network's performance were studied. Finally, the influence of critical time-varying parameters on key performance indicators of the inbound IRP network was studied. The key findings of this study can be highlighted as follows: (i) A near-optimal solution scenario indicated that LDV and MDV are used more frequently for product component collection. (ii) A heterogeneous vehicle fleet should be used if the priority is to reduce the total network cost. (iii) If the priority is to reduce carbon emissions, a homogeneous fleet of MDVs is recommended. (iv) Carbon emissions and network costs can be reduced in a scenario of low demand variation or high supply risks. (v) The performance of the inbound IRP network is insensitive to variations in the travel cost per unit distance. Moreover, the following are some important future research directions: (i) Verify the applicability of the proposed model using real-life case studies. (ii) Develop and verify a robust decision-making framework under the uncertainty of several parameters (e.g., demand, fuel price, vehicle travel cost per unit distance, base prices of product components).","satya prakash and indrajit mukherjee shailesh j. mehta school of management indian institute of technology bombay-400076, india satya.prakash@iitb.ac.in, indrajitmukherjee@iitb.ac.in",

Three phases of this continuous improvement project have been enacted to solidify the process on the A&D side and gather data to see if there was any truth to this feeling. After reviewing the data, it was determined that it was impossible to tell if checkout times were increased based on how inconsistent checkout times were. The first step needed to be to improve consistency of checkout times. Phase four is the next step in improving the checkout process, which will be to implement Gantner’s module template feature of GI.Bench along with an SOP of how to apply the templates. Phase five has also already been planned and will be implemented upon completion of phase four. Phase five will be development of a connecting adapter for quick interchange between modules; thus, reducing the transition time between verification of each module. This project came to fruition after the release of the new Gantner X.Series product line. Therefore, another future improvement phase could be to brainstorm and develop improvements on reducing the learning curve of future new product or hardware launches.","kayla j. buczkowski applications service engineer at a&d technology and masters of engineering management and masters of industrial engineering candidate of the college of engineering lawrence technological university southfield, mi 48075, usa kbuczkows@ltu.edu",

47,Design Of Assessment Of Customer Order Acceptance Using  Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis Method In Companies,"the production system in the manufacturing industry is divided into two types, namely the make-to-stock (mts) and make-to-order (mto) strategies which are distinguished by the time orders are received and the execution of the production process. in the mto system, the customer's order becomes a trigger for the next process and becomes a critical point of the system. the decision to accept and reject incoming orders is the most important activity because it will have a long-term impact on the overall profitability and reputation of the company. this activity is a very strategic action, so support is needed in this activity. this study investigates how the method of receiving orders in the mto strategy is carried out and designs an assessment of order acceptance using the multiple criteria decision analysis method so that it can be used as a support in making orders for acceptance decisions. the ahp method was used in this study to obtain priority order criteria and risk probabilities of receiving orders with data obtained from expert interviews. the results of ahp show the order of importance in receiving orders, namely the availability of raw materials, prices, production capabilities, market situations, customers, targets, order fulfillment, and external conditions, also the probability of the risk occurring. expected monetary value is calculated for each criterion and risk which is then used to help make the right decisions in accepting orders. the entire methodology in this study is explained by using cases in the steel coating industry in indonesia. the case study shows that emv and ahp can be used to provide a feasibility assessment of orders received.","make-to-order, order acceptance","Even though the target of the company is to make a profit, the price factor is not a major factor in the decision to accept customer orders. The most dominant consideration factor for the company when receiving an order is the aspect of availability of raw materials. In the AHP calculation that has been carried out, the raw material criteria have the highest weight of 17.20%. While the price criterion ranks second with a weight value of 14.26%. Therefore in making decisions when receiving customer orders, the first thing to consider is the availability of raw materials and then the price factor. Other consideration factors then follow, such as production capability and allocation, market conditions, consumer conditions, target fulfillment, order fulfillment, and external conditions. Calculation of risk by using EMV can be done to calculate the risk of orders received even though the value of the expected marginal profit by the company is different from the risk value calculated by EMV. This EMV calculation does not replace the price calculation carried out by the company, but this EMV calculation can be used as a tool to complete the assessment of the feasibility of the price of the order to be received. To reduce the risk of incoming orders, a new customer order acceptance flow recommendation has been made. The company should try to implement this flow and set EMV standards/limits for orders received. Therefore it can be easier to evaluate incoming customer orders. Measuring the performance of evaluating customer order acceptance with EMV can be carried out again or periodically after the proposed strategy has been successfully implemented by the company. This is useful to see whether the proposed improvements that have been implemented can improve the company's performance in terms of receiving customer orders or not. Suggestions for improvements to weight, opportunity, and impact on EMV calculations can be made by looking at the existing conditions to continue to get better EMV calculation results. Recommendations for further research can be carried out, especially in other industries that implement MTO to obtain a comparison of the results of EMV assessment performance and also continuous improvement for companies in industries that implement the MTO system.","using make-to-order systems andi nugraha, and maya arlini puspasari, department of industrial engineering, university of indonesia, depok, jawa barat, indonesia andi.nugraha@ui.ac.id ; mayaarlini@ui.ac.id",

50,The Cutting Stock Problem With Diameter Conversion In The  Construction Industry,"solving the one-dimensional cutting stock problem (1-d csp) has been widely integrated in construction industry for better managing cutting reinforcement steel bars (rebars). to provide the required tensile strength to the structure, the structural designer determines the diameter sizes of rebars, which can be adjusted as long as the rebar to concrete area ratio remains constant. the decision-maker has the option to alter the diameter size to optimize cutting patterns, thereby reducing raw material usage. in our study, we address the cutting stock problem by considering not only the cutting patterns but also the diameter sizes, with the objective of minimizing raw material usage. unlike the classical cutting stock problem, where the number of pieces to be cut is known in advance, in this case, the number of pieces is not known until the diameter sizes are selected. to tackle this challenge, we propose a solution that employs a pseudo-polynomial formulation. our computational study shows that converting diameters could enhance the 1-d cutting stock problem's solution quality by up to 6%.",,"The construction industry has many improvement opportunities by leveraging Operations Research methodologies. One of the most significant cost components in construction is reinforcement steel bars. Although the 1-D CSP has been extensively studied in literature and can provide efficient cutting patterns for rebars, incorporating diameter convertibility into the decision-making process can lead to even better patterns and reduced trim loss. In this paper, we introduce a new problem in the construction industry that considers both diameter selection and cutting pattern generation. Our computational experiments, which utilize real data from construction projects, show that project properties such as item count and minimum length have a significant impact on solution quality. Additionally, we propose a solution approach that involves rounding up length sizes to reduce network size and increase the effectiveness of the reflect formulation in attacking the 1.5-D CSP. Our results demonstrate that incorporating diameter convertibility can lead to cost savings of up to 6% for the 1.5-D CSP.","deniz altinpulluk, nur banu altinpulluk department of industrial and systems engineering wayne state university 4815 4th st, detroit, mi 48201, usa deniz@wayne.edu, nurbanu@wayne.edu haldun sural department of industrial engineering middle east technical university universiteler mahallesi, dumlupınar bulvari no: 1 06800 cankaya, ankara, turkey hsural@metu.edu.tr",
51,"The Heuristic Methods For Production Scheduling With  Unrelated Parallel Machine, And Joband Machine-","this study focuses on production scheduling problems in metal pipe manufacturing, where customer orders differ in terms of type, thickness, and quantity. each order is considered a job with a processing time that varies based on the machines involved in the production process. to produce the next job, there is a setup time required that depends on the machine, which is assigned to, and the current job being processed on that machine which is referred to as a job- and machine-sequence-dependent setup time. since it is not possible to obtain an optimal solution for a large scheduling problem by using the mathematical programming approach, a heuristic method is a preferable choice to handle this. therefore, this paper aims to illustrate the application of heuristics that features dispatching rules to solve the aforementioned scheduling problem through a numerical example. these rules, which explicitly consider the job- and machine-dependent setup time include the shortest job completion time, shortest job completion time based on the longest processing time, and shortest job completion time based on the earliest due date, and shortest job completion based on the minimum slack. a comparison regarding the effectiveness of these rules is also conducted. the results show that the shortest job completion time based on the minimum slack yields the best performance concerning the makespan and the second-best performance in terms of total tardiness. in addition, the shortest job completion time based on the earliest due date produces the best performance for both total tardiness and the number of tardy jobs.",heuristic methods,"In this paper, four heuristics are proposed to solve the unrelated parallel machine scheduling problem with the job- and machine-sequence-dependent setup time. Their effectiveness is evaluated according to three performance metrics, i.e., makespan, total tardiness, and the number of tardy jobs through a numerical example. The results indicate that SC-Minslack is the most effective heuristic method for minimizing makespan, while SC-EDD provides the best performance for both total tardiness and the number of tardy jobs. Although SC-LPT is the second-best heuristic method for minimizing makespan, it produces the worst results for both total tardiness and the number of tardy jobs. For future research, developing metaheuristic algorithms may be a promising avenue to obtain schedules that offer a better trade-off among the three measures of performance.","sequence-dependent setup time prasal soeurn school of manufacturing systems and mechanical engineering (msme) sirindhorn international institute of technology thammasat university pathum thani, thailand m6422040474@g.siit.tu.ac.th pham duc tai school of manufacturing systems and mechanical engineering (msme) sirindhorn international institute of technology thammasat university pathum thani, thailand tai.pham@siit.tu.ac.th jirachai buddhakulsomsiri school of manufacturing systems and mechanical engineering (msme) sirindhorn international institute of technology thammasat university pathum thani, thailand jirachai@siit.tu.ac.th",
52,Simulation-Based Modeling For Min/Max Ordering Policy  For Repairable Items Inventory Systems,"the inventory system of repairable items is a managerial tool used to integrate all information concerning on-hand inventories and movements for new and repaired items. the paper describes developing a simulation model for managing the inventory of repairable items for a manufacturing system where faulty items are sent to a repair shop with uncertain failure rates, lead times, and repair times. the proposed model imitates processing and controlling the on-hand inventory of repaired items and replenishing the inventory of new items using the minimum/maximum ordering policy in a flexible and risk-free environment. we exhibit the appropriateness and effectiveness of the suggested simulation model using a demonstrative case problem. the developed model can be relied on as a tool for estimating healthy on-hand inventories of new and repaired items, downtime, and back-ordered items due to the unavailability of repaired items.","repairable items, inventory system, simulation","Simulation modeling has become a promising method for investigating real-world processes. This paper described the development of a simulation model. The proposed model's objective is to investigate the utilization of the maximum/minimum inventory level strategy for ordering new repairable items in a flexible and risk-free manner. We presented a case problem of inventory of repairable items to exemplify the proposed simulation model's applicability and suitability. The key outcomes are the valuable model for maximum/minimum ordering policy, as just building a simulation model into the complex inventory system of repairable items is instructive regardless of results. The proposed model provided promising managerial insights about maximum/minimum ordering policy that would further be compared with other ordering strategies as a future study. These managerial insights are vital for achieving organizations' objectives, such as minimizing inventory costs and maximizing service levels. 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 500 550 600 1 day 3 days 5 days 7 days 10 days 12 days 15 days 20 days Max New Items On-hand Inventory Max Repaired Items On-hand Inventory Max No. of Orders Max No. of Backordered Items Max Unavailability 461","mojahid f. saeed osman department of industrial and manufacturing engineering north dakota state university fargo, north dakota, usa","References

53,An Efficient Simulated Annealing Algorithm For The Joint  Order Batching And Picker Routing Problem In Manual,"order picking is the process of collecting products from the warehouse to fulfill specific customer orders, which is known to be labor- and time-intensive. order picking significantly determines the warehouse's performance, contributing 50% to 75% of operational costs. therefore, the efficiency of the order-picking process also affects the supply chain performance. this study investigates two of five main order-picking problems jointly, which are classified in its day-to-day operational problem: order batching and picker routing. the algorithm to solve the problem is developed using metaheuristics, the simulated annealing algorithm. the algorithm avoids local optimization to find better solutions. the algorithm is validated through preliminary testing against problem instances of online grocery shopping cases with 1560 products where each order can consist of many items. the proposed algorithm has proven to be more efficient than the previous approach, which gives quality solutions using less run-time, especially for larger problem instances.","order batching, picker routing, order picking","This paper developed an efficient 2-stage simulated annealing algorithm to solve the JOBPRP, especially for large problems, in manual order picking systems for multi-blocks warehouses. Order picking, specifically order batching and picker routing contributes significantly to warehouse and supply chain costs and performance. Even though the order batching and picker routing problems in order picking have received much attention from researchers, some limitations exist, providing the gap to be filled by this paper. The algorithm was developed using simulated annealing metaheuristics in 2 stages, first for providing initial solution from the batching decision, continued with routing for each batch. Preliminary testing results show good algorithm scalability in solving large instances of up to 30 orders with a great variety in each order. In addition, comparison with the previous branch-and-cut algorithm (Valle et al., 2017) shows a significant improvement in computational time reduced, unfortunately at the cost of reduced solution quality of an average of 13%. This tradeoff is still reasonable, considering the significant reduction in computation times. The main contribution of this study is developing an efficient algorithm that can provide quality solutions with significantly short computational times compared to the previous algorithm. The study’s main limitation lies in the increased objective function compared to previous literature. Thus, future research can be done in order to enhance the algorithm by incorporating methods to improve the computational results.","order picking systems felicia nathania and komarudin department of industrial engineering universitas indonesia depok, west java 16424, indonesia felicianath10@gmail.com, komarudin01@gmail.com",

57,Strategic Analysis Of Digital Technologies In The Healthcare  Sector Through The Application Of Multiple Preference,"digital technologies are including many different technologies that enable information to be collected, stored, and easily accessed when needed. the use of digital technologies is also increasing in the health sector, where service processes are intense and complex. strategic considerations would be appropriate to analyze the use of these technologies. for this reason, in this study, a strategic evaluation was made on digital technologies in the health sector. with the swot analysis, the current situation analysis regarding digital technologies in the health sector was made. then, the weights of swot factors were determined with the multiple preference relations (mpr) integrated dematel method. subsequently, alternative strategies were determined and prioritized with mpr integrated topsis method. the mpr technique is aimed to analyze the uncertainties and reach more accurate and reliable results by gathering the evaluations of experts in different formats or incomplete opinions under a single group decision. the proposed methodology integrated with swot analysis on digital technologies in the health sector constitutes the originality of the study. in line with the results obtained from this study, both researchers and managers will be able to create and use more effective digital technology strategies for the health sector.","swot analysis, dematel, topsis, healthcare","Today, the use of innovative technologies is seen as an important determinant in increasing the quality of health services and patient safety. Along with the strengths that the use of these technologies will bring, their weaknesses and opportunities/threats should also be analyzed, and progress should be made in line with appropriate strategies. SWOT analysis is the most prominent strategic evaluation methods in the literature. When the literature is examined, it was seen that SWOT analysis was not performed with MPR integrated DEMATEL and TOPSIS in the field of the use of digital technologies in the health sector. For this reason, in this study, a SWOT analysis of the use of digital technologies in the health sector was made. SWOT factors were evaluated with the MPR DEMATEL method, and alternative strategies were prioritized with MPR TOPSIS. It is one of the results of the study that importance should be given to the strengths it will provide for the effective use of digital technologies. In addition, in order to benefit from technology in the most effective way, it will be important to create a development roadmap first. In the future, this study can be expanded by taking the opinions of more experts, and a more detailed study can be made by increasing the SWOT factors.

58,Evaluation Of Digital Transformation Success Factors In Air  Cargo Industry Using Ifcm Approach,"in the last few years, the world has witnessed major events. while the world was struggling with the effects of covid- 19, on the other hand, people and companies tried to adapt to digital transformation (dt) with the acceleration in technological developments and the needs brought by covid-19. the pandemic process has accelerated the world's adaptation to this transformation. the pandemic process has increased the growth rate of e-commerce, which is already growing rapidly, and increased its influence in the air cargo market. moreover, market growth is not the only challenge facing the air cargo industry. just as it affects every industrial area, dt has started to show its effects in this area as well. at this point, the competition has become fiercer than ever before. air cargo companies need to adapt to dt to compete in the growing market, maintain or increase their market share, generate profits, and enable their sustainability. therefore, air cargo companies must consider critical success factors to successfully implement the transformation. for this purpose, some critical success factors are collected through a literature review process and expert opinions. a case study is conducted using an intuitionistic fuzzy cognitive map (ifcm) approach to analyze these factors in the turkish air cargo industry. furthermore, an ifcm model of these factors is presented. the study results show that the most critical success factors are supply chain visibility, digital twin, and piece centricity among these interrelated factors.",air cargo industry,"and Perspective DT is an undeniable reality of today. The impact of technology on both human life and the business world will be even greater. This situation has begun to affect all sectors from end to end. One of these sectors is the air cargo industry, which keeps the supply chain in the world alive and makes great contributions to the economy of both countries and the world. The air cargo industry, which has grown in line with the demands and needs, has turned into an ecosystem where competition is intense with the DT. Therefore, it's more important than ever to focus on the successful sustainability of the transformation. In this study, some of the critical factors that need to be considered for the successful implementation of DT are investigated and analyzed by the IFCM approach on a real case in the Turkish air cargo industry. The obtained results are in line with the points emphasized by the companies in their research reports. Scenario and sensitivity analyses can be performed in future studies. The scope and the number of the evaluation criteria can be expanded. The results can be compared by making calculations based on different extensions. Results from analytical techniques based on the assumption of independence of criteria can be examined. Acknowledgements The authors would like to give sincere gratitude to industrial experts.

59,Conceptualization Of The Servuccion In Outpatient Care In  Level 3 Health Companies Under Lean Healthcare,"this article aims to conceptualize the manufacture of outpatient services in a level 3 entity of the health sector, under a lean healthcare approach. for the development of the proposed objective, it was necessary to characterize the system from the analysis of waiting lines due to the variable and non-deterministic behavior commonly observed in service systems. the phases of the characterization are composed of a general description of the processes that make up the outpatient service, followed by an economic-operational diagnosis, where productivity measurement was used with a value-added approach (mpva) and a questionnaire to evaluate compliance with criteria of the lean philosophy. using the kolmogorov-smirnov test, probability functions are determined and from this the process of outpatient care is conceptually proposed.","lean healthcare, servuccion","• As described in the statistical analysis, the behavior of the outpatient consultation process of the entity providing health services Ltda., object of study shows a great randomness and variability precisely due to the diversity of specialized medical services manufactured, which greatly hinders to develop an optimal operations management, supported by a process management and a standardized structure. • Given the randomness and variability of patients and symptoms treated in the entity providing health services, the production system developed by the organization is framed in a structure by projects where the service is made in a personalized way and tailored to each patient, which largely makes it impossible for care times to be the same for each patient, but nevertheless by government guidelines and for the sake of To guarantee coverage, accessibility and timeliness to the health care service, standardized care times of between 15 – 20 minutes per patient have been established. • Another mitigating factor in the manufacture of medical services offered by the entity providing health services is the availability of specialized medical personnel, as can be seen in the schedule the use of the system is not 100% which greatly impacts the opportunity in the allocation of appointments. • From the measurement of productivity with a value-added approach, it can be affirmed that the company shows healthy finances, is a company that responds positively to its social interest groups and that operationally speaking behaves appropriately and adjusted to the behavior of the health system. • From the diagnosis of the lean approach, it can be established that an organization that does not focus its work on the reduction of waste, given the variability of medical services, symptoms that attend and diversity of patients is difficult to standardize processes but nevertheless it would be possible to organize and / or synchronize in a better way its activities in order to continuously improve its levels of quality and productivity and therefore its profitability. • It should be noted that the proposed conceptual model serves as an initial framework for future research such as the development of simulation models using software such as Flexsim and / promodel as the object of validating their behavior and thus proceed to make the respective adjustments and changes in the medical protocols that to date are working in the institution. 531","approach: case study hernando garzón saenz ciptec research group - faculty of engineering - industrial engineering program - technology in industrial production fundacion universitaria tecnologico comfenalco cartagena de indias, colombia hernando.garzon@tecnologicocomfenalco.edu.co andrés redchuk etsii. department of computer sciences. university rey juan carlos. madrid. spain. director of operational excellence and process improvement institute. school of engineer. university of lomas de zamora. argentina. andres.redchuk@urjc.es josé manuel solana garzón ciptec research group- faculty of engineering - industrial engineering program - technology in industrial production fundacion universitaria tecnologico comfenalco cartagena de indias - colombia jsolana@tecnologicocomfenalco.edu.co gustavo adolfo ortiz piedrahita ciptec research group- faculty of engineering - industrial engineering program - technology in industrial production fundacion universitaria tecnologico comfenalco cartagena de indias - colombia gortizp@tecnocomfenalco.edu.co","References

60,Autonomy Selection In Self-Driving Vehicles By An  Integrated Spherical Fuzzy Todim,"technological improvement for the safe and efficient use of self-driving vehicles continues at full speed. the development in this area in the coming years seems to affect human lives significantly. by the progress in industry 4.0, products and hardware developed with software can exchange smart da-ta to ensure their management and optimization. it is possible to say that there will be much work about this technology shortly, even if they are not yet widely used. the investments of giant companies in this technology al-so support this development. however, the benefits and costs of autonomous vehicles are still mostly hypothetical. self-driving cars layer their autonomy into six categories according to the capability of different levels of self-driving. deciding on the autonomy of self-driving vehicles is a complicated procedure that requires various attributes to consider. multi-criteria decision making (mcdm) techniques are built to assist these kinds of decision-making problems. fuzzy extensions aim to define judgments of decision-makers more explicitly and informatively by building on membership functions having three distinct dimensions. a new extension of ordinary fuzzy sets has been developed recently based on generalized three- dimensions called sfss (spherical fuzzy sets). in this study, the aim is to apply sf-todim (spherical fuzzy tomada de decisão interativa multicritério) mcdm method to evaluate autonomy selection in self-driving vehicles problem in a group decision making environment. the autonomy selection in self-driving vehicles is assessed with five layers of autonomy using six criteria in order to demonstrate the applicability and validity of the developed sf-todim approach.","autonomy selection, mcdm, todim","The main objective of this study is to evaluate autonomy selection in self-driving vehicles problem in a Group Decision Making setting by considering a set of evaluation criteria. The evaluation of automation requires an examination of diverse qualitative and quantitative factors. MCDM techniques are scientific methods that can evaluate qualitative and quantitative factors together. That is why, TODIM, which is one of the distance-based MCDM methods, has been used to evaluate the alternatives of self-driving automation layers. In order to select the best suitable level of automation, identification of decision criteria needs to be taken into account. An extant review of the literature and three DMs are used to do it suitable. The SFS TODIM MCDM method is applied to evaluate all candidate levels by the light of the given attributes. The SFS environment is chosen as an objective world to assess and rank the automation level for the given problem. The SFS has shown explicit advantages in handling uncertainty over crisp or fuzzy sets to depict DMs’ evaluations, allowing for a more representative decision-making. Besides, it is chosen to derive the A1 A1 A1 A1 A1 A2 A2 A2 A2 A2 A3 A3 A3 A3 A3 A4 A4 A4 A4 A4 A5 A5 A5 A5 A5 A6 A6 A6 A6 A6 Case 1 Case 2 Case 3 Case 4 Case 5 538","gülçin büyüközkan industrial engineering department, galatasaray university, ortaköy, istanbul, turkey gulcin.buyukozkan@gmail.com fethullah göçer industrial engineering department, kahramanmaraş sütçü i̇mam university, onikişubat, kahramanmaraş, turkey gocer.fethullah@gmail.com","References

61,Visualizing A Local Food Bank’S Chronic Health Disease  Population,"food insecurity hinders individuals from the healthy and sustainable life they truly deserve. unfortunately, food insecurity and chronic health diseases affect millions of people across the united states. food banks are constantly fighting the uphill battle against food insecurity to supply adequate, relevant, healthy meals to those who need them. oftentimes hunger relief organizations lack data and software tools that could aid strategic decision-making. a local food bank faces this exact problem and is struggling to find clients that face chronic health diseases in their service area. this study uses data from the local food bank to develop visualizations that investigate the health considerations of the population they serve. the results easily found a specific county with the largest number of health considerations and a zip code with the highest number of individuals facing hypertension. dominant chronic health considerations highlight the importance for food banks to diversify their food selections. it is important for the local food bank to know what foods are essential within each county and zip code area to provide services that will be valuable to those who need them. this study benefits food banks so they can yield better service to the community.","food insecurity, food bank","Eating healthy foods and having access to healthy foods should be the same for everyone. Hunger relief organizations play a huge part in serving and feeding our communities. People are food insecure, and it is also clear that people across the country are facing health diseases. These chronic diseases can be mitigated with access to healthy foods, which is why there needs to be a push for healthy access. For these food banks to serve, they need to be equipped with the knowledge and easy-to-use tools to help them assist others. This research was able to provide a solution to the local food bank’s needs. The products of this study, specifically the dashboard comprised of data visualizations, can offer several benefits to the local food bank. This organization can save money, make data-driven decisions, and become more responsive to the needs of the community. First, the food bank can optimize its distribution strategies by identifying the specific counties and zip codes people face chronic diseases. The local food bank can ultimately save money since they can focus on areas with higher needs, ensuring that the right amounts of food are provided to underserved communities. This targeted approach will ultimately reduce waste and efficiently allocate resources which will lead to cost savings for the organization. 547","mikaya hamilton, steven jiang, and lauren davis department of industrial and systems engineering north carolina agricultural and technical state university 1601 e market st., greensboro, nc 27411, usa","References

62,Improvement Proposal To Standardize And   Increase The Production Of A Spinning Company,"in the present research paper, proposals for improvement related to lean manufacturing will be analyzed with the aim of standardizing production and increasing productivity in the production area of a spinning company, using automation and plant layout tools. initially, a high variability in production time was identified within the fiber preparation and mixing area, which caused instability and decreased productivity in the zone. after a preliminary analysis, it was found that increasing the amount of fibers used in the process (e.g. from 2 to 3 fibers) resulted in an increase in total production time. subsequently, a comprehensive evaluation was carried out in the selected company, observing the production processes in order to select the most critical stage of the process within the area to implement an improvement. finally, different improvement proposals were compared, and it was determined that the most effective and viable ones were automation and a new distribution of the work area. after implementation, an average reduction of 31% in production time was achieved, circulation time was reduced, and monthly production in the area was stabilized.","lean manufacturing, automation, textile industry, productivity","As demonstrated by the results obtained, following the implementation of the improvement proposal, a 31% reduction in production times was achieved at the fiber preparation and mixing station through the automation of manual operation at the ""workstation"" (fiber weighing, initial fiber opener, cake formation, and ensiling spray) and a reorganization of the plant with the new machinery. Through this automation, standardization of production in the aforementioned station is achieved due to the constant work of the machine (being a programmable device, it does not incur fatigue, downtime, or idle time) and in conjunction with the distribution of the plant and the savings of meters in the productive path (which can be translated into time), compliance with the regularization and increase in production in the fiber preparation and mixing station is achieved. In this way, it can be affirmed that the problem of the research is solved, giving as true the principal and specific hypotheses initially proposed since the process was standardized and the production of the area was increased through the application of lean manufacturing (automation and systematic layout), providing flexibility in the production area so that the production process can adapt to the different and varied types of orders that presented problems initially due to the low flexibility and high dependence on labor (identified root causes), which could be quantitatively justified through the indicators presented in the previous chapters.","through lean manufacturing juan carlos chiroque seminario and sergio crosato oyarce facultad de ingeniería y arquitectura, universidad de lima lima, perú jcchiroque@gmail.com; scrosato99@gmail.com ávalos - ortecho edilberto miguel facultad de ingeniería y arquitectura, universidad de lima, lima, perú eavalos@ulima.edu.pe",
63,Research On The Future Distribution Industry Using  Artificial Intelligence,"artificial intelligence has begun to be applied to various industries such as manufacturing, medical care, and transportation, and the distribution industry is one of the fields where artificial intelligence is applied at the forefront. in retail, artificial intelligence can be applied in virtually any area where businesses need to make strategic decisions, such as store location selection, staff recruitment, sales forecasting, and inventory management. artificial intelligence will also change the shopping environment perceived by consumers. this shift can be seen in the shopping search and purchase process, shopping site design, and the rise of artificially intelligent robots serving as skilled salespeople. these ai-led changes can be summarized as reading and adapting to customers minds, and are expected to fundamentally change the future of the distribution industry. considering the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology, domestic retailers are far behind, so it seems that more attention and investment in the field of artificial intelligence will be needed in the future.",ai,"The application of artificial intelligence in the distribution industry is only at the beginning stage, and considering the speed of development of artificial intelligence technology, it is expected that the landscape of the industry will fundamentally change in the future.

64,Convolutional Neural Network Architectures   Analysis For Image Captioning,"the image captioning models with the attention method have developed significantly compared to previous models, but it is still unsatisfactory in recognizing images. the early image captioning models were built by combining cnn as an encoder and rnn as a decoder, making them susceptible to the influence of each cnn and rnn model. in particular, the cnn network has shown performance differences over time, which affects the rnn model used as a decoder. in this paper, we experiment with various cnn architectures to improve the performance of image captioning based on the cnn architecture as a reference. we analyze the performance of image captioning based on the performance of various cnn architecture models. we compared seven different cnn architectures, according to batch size, using public benchmarks: ms-coco datasets. all cnn architectures used in this study are pre-trained networks on the imagenet dataset. in our experimental results, densenet (huang et al. 2017) and inceptionv3 (szegedy et al. 2016) got the most satisfactory result among the seven cnn architectures after training 50 epochs on gpu.","deep learning, computer vision, image captioning","In this paper, we experimented with seven pre-trained CNN architectures on the ImageNet, to improve the CNN encoder for Image Captioning. Among them, DenseNet, and InceptionV3 showed the best results with a loss of about 15% and a training time of around 160 seconds per epoch in the MS-COCO dataset. Interestingly, the other five CNN architectures, which performed similarly well to DenseNet and InceptionV3, exhibited unstable training losses and irregular fluctuations depending on the batch size. We argue that this may be due to poor compatibility between certain CNN encoders and the LSTM decoder used in our Image Captioning model.","jun seung woo, shin dong ho, student and professor, my paul school 12-11, dowontongmi-gil, cheongcheon-myeon, goesan-gun, chungcheongbuk-do, republic of korea eavatar@hanmail.net",
65,A Study On Whether Artificial Intelligence Can Have Artificial  Emotions,"this paper discusses the feasibility and potential risks of artificial emotions. it is an era of worrying about the overtaking of artificial intelligence from a cognitive point of view, which is considered to be a human domain, and people are now trying to find out human nature with emotion, not reason. recently, the task of infusing emotions into artificial intelligence robots is emerging as a new topic. first, let's take a look at the development of emotional robots and their main motivations, and why robots' emotions matter. in order to examine whether a robot possessing true emotions is possible, we do not define emotions a priori, but introduce some important roles that emotions play and propose criteria for giving emotions to certain objects. against these criteria, true emotional robots are unlikely to become a reality in the near future. however, even before robots possessing emotions appear, unilateral emotional communication with robots with a certain degree of autonomy is potentially dangerous, and it is thought that it is good to prepare for it.","ai, deep learning, economic","Due to the rich emotions that humans experience, we live a human life. However, artificial emotions or emotional robots are not a logical contradiction. It would not be necessary to fundamentally rule out the possibility that artificial objects such as robots could one day have not only intelligence but also emotions. If an artifact with intelligence at or beyond human intelligence could have some kind of mental state, the discussion of the possibility that it might even possess emotions would not be just nonsense. However, in order to determine that an object possesses emotions, difficult conditions must be met. Only actors who can act adaptively by evaluating the value of stimuli given to them in a complex and sometimes hostile environment for their survival and homeostasis can be said to have the basic conditions for possessing emotions. In order for artificial intelligence to evolve into a being with real emotions beyond merely recognizing and mimicking human emotional expressions, it may have to possess a body like an organism. I'm not sure we want such AI. Before discussing true artificial emotions that may occur in the future, it is necessary to anticipate and prepare for potential risks that one-sided emotional sympathy with emotional robots may bring.","lee ji yun, shin dong ho student and professor, my paul school 12-11, dowontongmi-gil, cheongcheon-myeon, goesan-gun, chungcheongbuk-do, republic of korea eavatar@hanmail.net jeongwon kim student, department of economics, college of economics, nihon university, 3-2 kanda-misakicho, 1-chome, chiyoda-ku, tokyo, japan eavatar@hanmail.net",
66,Future Prospects Of Governance And Democracy Using  Artificial Intelligence,"artificial intelligence is shaping the future of politics through a digital political revolution. in this context, we look at the impact of artificial intelligence on democracy in terms of freedom, equality, and political action. artificial intelligence has a positive aspect of expanding the realm of human freedom through citizen's political participation, the spread of digital liberalism, and the improvement of human capabilities. on the other hand, artificial intelligence violates individual freedom by depriving human spirit, intuition, free will, and autonomy by replacing human self- improvement, human authority with algorithms, and labor with robots. artificial intelligence is more likely to fall into the trap of digital dictatorship by falling into dataism as it focuses on procedural democracy rather than substantive democracy. algorithms tune the human mind and emotions to create an orwellian monitor that continuously observes every individual. algorithms are likely to give control to a small elite, and new forms of authoritarian control will emerge. ai governance is based on whether citizens will actively participate in politics to overcome the problems of modern representative democracy and restore democracy, or go to digital totalitarianism by a group of data elites. in order to achieve a new alternative political system beyond digital dictatorship, civil society must secure the right to control data, and human authority must not be replaced by data authority.","ai, deep learning","Artificial intelligence governance can present a bright digital future through data transparency and efficient prediction through various information, but the dark digital future caused by algorithmic governance is more prominent. Algorithmic democracy plays a greater role as an institutional device for obtaining power through voting than the normative aspect of democracy or the practical meaning of democracy. The acquisition of power and the emphasis on procedural aspects will accelerate the programmation of politics and make politics automatable. Such automation will more easily delegate political issues and social debates to algorithms rather than to human intellects, value judgments, and social consultations. With the development of algorithms, the axis of political power will be transferred to artificial intelligence from humans centered on citizens. In addition, artificial intelligence will pollute political activities and the election environment by illegally collecting data, manipulating public opinion, and influencing elections and voting in various ways, destroying trust in public institutions and trust in free and fair elections. AI governance is the reality of complex systems, the demand for a sustainable society, and the request to overcome the crisis of capitalism. It will continue to develop in tandem with citizens' personalized desires. A government that controls algorithms can control human minds and emotions, make people love themselves and hate their enemies, and citizens cannot resist the regime. If algorithms are concentrated in a small elite class, a new type of authoritative governance structure will be formed because the general public cannot escape the elite's influence. In order to achieve a new alternative political system, there must be a way to strengthen social power, such as civil society and community, over data power under human control, without human authority being replaced by data authority. As a way to strengthen social power, two aspects, institutional and individual, should be considered. First, an artificial intelligence-based algorithmic democracy platform is institutionally established, and by using artificial intelligence technology, citizens can make decisions directly or realize ideas for solving social problems in policies. Second, a strategy for coexistence between artificial intelligence and human beings is needed to protect human dignity by maintaining individual autonomy and free will at the individual level. The biggest problem in artificial intelligence governance is to hand over the quantified ego and human decision-making power that self-recognizes through 0 and 1. To solve this problem, it is to improve the ability and judgment to be able to control the algorithm and interpret the output produced by the algorithm. Education and institutionalization that can cultivate the ability to derive appropriate implications for the results produced by humans and artificial intelligence must be centered on citizens, and future politics will ultimately be driven by data and people. 598","jung ji-seok, shin dong ho student and professor, my paul school 12-11, dowontongmi-gil, cheongcheon-myeon, goesan-gun, chungcheongbuk-do, republic of korea eavatar@hanmail.net jeongwon kim student, department of economics, college of economics, nihon university, 3-2 kanda-misakicho, 1-chome, chiyoda-ku, tokyo, japan eavatar@hanmail.net","References

68,A Statistical Approach To Reduce The Manufacturing  Process Qualification Cost And Sample Size,"process qualification is a common norm in the manufacturing/ consumer electronics industry. with product lifecycle becoming shorter , we see new product introductions at a rapid pace today than anytime before. new products means setting up more and more new processes ,machines, and production lines. with product quality becoming the centre of attention for most organisations, there has been increasing demand for optimization of statistical process qualifications. generally, to qualify a new manufacturing process, the quality engineers follow a statistical approach by measuring the performance of a specific quality of parts. however, in some scenarios like in high volume manufacturing, we might encounter lots of new processes under multiple product configurations which make statistical qualifications a huge cost adder given so many quantities to test plus they also are a cause of manufacturing waste if the parts are not intended to be customer shipped. in this paper, we propose a new solution that leverages a 2 step testing method mainly based on binomial distribution and the main idea is if there is a process that sees early failures, we may be able to identify it with initial samples without the need to undergo complete qualification. further, we also prove through results that we can achieve 18-25% reduction in samples while keeping same statistical confidence. 606",,,"angad arora manufacturing data scientist, google inc angadarora@google.com",

71,A Spatial Analyze Approach For Determining The Best  Possible Locations Of Police Stations In Azaz,"in the context of sustainable urban planning, identifying an optimal land use location plays a crucial role in effectively managing land distribution. therefore, a comprehensive evaluation of various factors influencing the choice is necessary to determine the most suitable site. this paper aims to identify an appropriate location for a police station in azaz city using geographic information systems (gis). a novel approach is proposed by integrating service area analysis and multi-criteria analysis to minimize emergency response time. the evaluation process focuses on travel time from the existing police station within the study area. three critical zones were generated using network analysis, each representing coverage within a one-minute travel time. these critical zones were ranked and assigned weights based on their proximity to high-crime areas and travel time from other essential facilities. the facilities were categorized into three groups, namely education, health, and tourism services. a suitability map was created to determine the priority of alternative locations, and the highly suitable area was overlaid with an aerial photograph to assess land availability. finally, facility location-allocation techniques were utilized to select the optimal site for establishing a police station. this approach offers valuable insights for governmental bodies and urban planners seeking to make informed decisions regarding site selection.","spatial analysis, police station","The Risk-prone map can serve as a valuable tool for planners, insurers, and emergency services in selecting optimal sites for new police stations. The study highlights the role of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) in decision- making and optimal planning, emphasizing the importance of considering travel time and distance from facilities, as well as hotspot trends of crime to improve service delivery and increase safety. By integrating service areas in network analysis and multi-criteria analysis, the study provides a clear understanding of high-risk zones where minimizing response time is crucial. These high-risk zones are identified as suitable areas for candidate locations. Location- allocation analysis is then applied to choose the best location among the candidate facilities, considering cost and 627","m. radwan mouket department of industrial engineering gaziantep university gazianep, turkey radwanmouket@gmail.com alptekin durmuşoğlu department of industrial engineering gaziantep university gazianep, turkey durmusoglu@gantep.edu.tr","References

72,Turret Punch Time Estimate For Sheet Metal Parts Using  Machine Learning Approach,"turret punch machines have been used to produce parts in sheet metal shops since the 1950s. it is common to place multiple parts of different sizes and designs from multiple customers on one sheet blank to manufacture. however, this practice poses challenges in accurately calculating the fabrication time and subsequent manufacturing cost of each part. this is because turret punch machines only display the total machine run time per entire sheet blank, whereas the punching process depends not only on the parts themselves but also on the punching tools used and punching routes undertaken. this paper proposes a machine learning approach to solve this longstanding punching time distribution problem by using the punching tools’ hitting counts, the moving distances of sheet blanks and the number of tool changes during production time. 425 sheet blanks of parts with various designs and sizes are processed, and machine run times for each sheet blank are recorded from a turret punch simulation program. five common types of turret punching operations (“hit”), such as nibbling, single hit, line shearing and etc., along with transverse and longitudinal moving distances of sheet blanks and tool changes are considered in this research. every part on the sheet blanks is broken down into its component geometric entities (e.g. line, arc, hole, etc.). geometric entities are then grouped by the kind of punching hit and/or assigned punching tool itself. three supervised machine learning models, namely linear regression, ridge regression, and lasso regression are used and compared using 10-fold cross-validation process each consisting of 383 (90%) sheet blanks for training and the remaining (10%) for validation. the preliminary results indicate that the proposed machine learning approach is viable and consistent in determining the fabrication time for every part on sheet blanks manufactured by turret punch machines. the approach can be integrated with real-time data collection of the counts of punching hits, parts’ geometry, sheet blank’s motion and machine run time on any turret punch machines to determine the fabrication time and subsequent manufacturing cost of each part in the industry 4.0 era.","machine learning, time estimate, automation","A new approach is proposed to distribute the machine run time of sheet blanks to the parts on sheet blanks for all turret punch machines. It adopts the Machine Learning method and incorporates the counts of punching operations, transverse and longitudinal moving distances of sheet blanks, tool changes, and machine’s special commands as the modeling features. A punching simulation program is developed to provide a non-deterministic simulated machine run time for the sheet blanks. It also relates the punching tools, operations, routes and sequences to the parts on sheet blanks and retrieves applicable modeling features. 425 training sheet blanks are executed to train the Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, and Lasso Regression models. Using the 10-fold cross-validation procedure, the training result shows that all three models can achieve 99% accuracy scores. Furthermore, one test sheet blank is executed to verify the viability and consistency of the proposed approach. Our results demonstrate that the proposed approach is viable and consistent to provide machine run time and subsequent manufacturing cost for parts of various geometries and sizes on sheet blanks. It can replace the subjective estimation or simple calculation currently used in industry, and can be automated with real-time data collection in the era of Industry 4.0. The approach can be expanded to incorporate laser cutting machines and develop a more comprehensive and versatile model for the laser-turret combination machines.

74,Ergonomic Design Of Driver’S Workstation For Modern  Jeepney Of Abc Transport Service And Multi-Purpose,"the jeepney is the most popular kind of public transportation in the philippines for its accessibility and affordability. over the years, the features of jeepneys have improved through modernization, yet there are still issues, particularly in the workstation design, that need to be addressed to reduce the vulnerability of jeepney drivers to work-related musculoskeletal disorders. in this study, the working condition of modern jeepney drivers at abc transport service and multi-purpose cooperative was assessed through observations with ten (10) drivers using the rapid upper limb assessment and rapid entire body assessment (focusing on the major processes involved such as driving, reaching, and payment), interviews with twenty (20) drivers using the nordic musculoskeletal questionnaire, and the gathering of anthropometric measurements of thirty-seven (37) drivers. results from rula and reba showed that medium risk was present, requiring further investigation to implement the necessary changes, while the nmq results revealed that 46.11% of the drivers experienced discomfort in at least one body part, of which 46.99% of them had trouble during the last seven days prior to the interview. spearman rank-order correlation analysis showed no significant relationship between the nmq scores and the rula and reba scores of the three major positions involved—driving, reaching, and payment. the results of these assessments, as well as the anthropometric measurements of the drivers, served as the basis for creating an ergonomic design for the workstation that provides greater comfort and safety.","drivers, modern jeepney","ABC Transport Service and Multipurpose Cooperative has two types of models for modern jeepneys. The movement of the driver slightly varies with the model of the unit the driver is using since the location of some controls differs from one model to the other. However, the researchers identified that with both models, reaching some controls is one of the problems encountered by the drivers during their work. The analysis found that one of the main reasons why the drivers experience work-related musculoskeletal pain and perform unsafe postures such as reaching is due to the existing design of the workstation, which is not based on the wide range of anthropometric measurements of the drivers. From the scores of the Rapid Upper Limb Assessment (RULA) and Rapid Entire Body Assessment (REBA), the result shows that further investigation and changes are needed to be implemented. Meanwhile, the Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire results revealed that 46.11% of respondents experienced trouble with at least one body part, while 46.99% of that number had trouble during the last seven (7) days prior to the interview. The researchers determined that there is no significant relationship between the result of the assessment using RULA and REBA and the physical discomfort experienced by the drivers using the NMQ when correlated.","cooperative jullian jessica p. libre, justine r. modomo, karl justin n. bariga, dr. james louie r. meneses and engr. jerico r. amago college of engineering manuel s. enverga university foundation lucena city, quezon, philippines jullianjessicaa@gmail.com, modomo.justine@gmail.com, karljustinbariga25@gmail.com, jameslouie.meneses@mseuf.edu.ph, j.amago@mseuf.edu.ph",
75,Decision Engineering And The Digital Twin Of An Acquisition  Program A Cumulative Case Study,"the regulatory environment of a major defense acquisition program changes throughout its life cycle, challenging generations of leaders to be custodians of corporate knowledge, and make decisions across an enterprise, sometimes without a comprehensive view of factors influencing their programs. tools such as digital twins, digital engineering, model-based systems engineering, and modeling & simulation have utility, but their value to managers is often illusive. this paper explores if program decision making can be digitally transformed by applying principles of decision science, theory & methods of systems engineering, and practices from business program management, to engineer decisions. this cumulative case study describes the background, purpose, method, and conclusions from four projects. a digital twin of a project can be constructed by modeling organization processes, digitalizing documents, linking live cross functional data, and connecting decisions to data to process. the resulting system has transparent processes, dynamic and relevant data models, and useful decision aids. this repository is an enduring, usable body of knowledge, linking decisions to the data required, and the business processes that create it. a program digital twin supports decision engineering: it identifies decision points, data required for those decisions, and processes necessary to produce the data.","digital twin, strategy, data model","The proper goal of digitalization is to make better decisions using quality data from lean processes. It is easy to see digitalization merely as a problem of new applications, or the introduction of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into processes, or new data models depending upon personal perspective or experience. However, none of those solutions alone will have sustained or meaningful impact. New models may be better, but may not result in better decisions if disconnected from a unified data model. A web services firm may be able to house petabytes of data for decades, but if it is not designed for people to use in conjunction with their digital supply chain, its customer value is limited. Using AI as support infrastructure to communicate with customers is common, but without integration with the business process, it may not deliver value. Entities have known they should digitalize, but did not know what or how to implement it. A program digital twin supports decision engineering: it identifies decision points, data required for those decisions, and processes necessary to produce the data.","stephen waugh, dba, timothy davis, phd, matthew tillman, phd, and justin shoger, m.s., phd (candidate) jhu/apl lexington park, md 20653, usa stephen.waugh@jhuapl.edu, timothy.davis@jhuapl.edu, matthew.tillman@jhuapl.edu, justin.shoger@jhuapl.edu",
76,Correlational Analysis Of Physical And Cognitive Workload  Factors To Musculoskeletal Discomfort Experienced By,"with the goal to increase production due to the growing demands in the construction industry, small businesses that manufacture hollowblocks utilize semi-automatic machines (to support the molding and compacting process) which is more financially feasible than adapting large-scale and fully automatic equipment. however, the process still requires intensive manual labor and operators exposed to such tasks experience discomfort often manifesting as muscle pain, fatigue, and stress. understanding the discomfort experienced by these workers in relation to physical and cognitive workload factors helps in designing work that maximizes productivity while also promoting occupational safety and health. in this study, the researchers used the cornell musculoskeletal discomfort questionnaire to assess worker discomfort, the fatigue assessment scale and cycle time measurement to describe physical workload, and the nasa-tlx and physiological measurements associated with stress level (pulse rate and blood oxygen level) to describe cognitive workload. results of the spearman rank-order correlation analysis show that cmdq scores are higher in those workers with higher physical workload measurements [fas score with rs=0.465 (p=0.06) and cycle time with rs=0.486 (p=0.048)]. meanwhile, when correlated against cognitive workload factors, cmdq scores are found to have a positive relationship with raw nasa-tlx score (rs=0.959; p=0.000) and pulse rate (rs=0.435; p=0.081), and a negative relationship with blood oxygen level (rs=-0.65; p=0.005). to mitigate workplace hazards and ergonomic risks that were found in the semi-automated hollowblock manufacturing sites, the researchers then developed an action plan implementing engineering and administrative controls focusing on modifications on the equipment, workplace layout, and operating procedures.","physical workload, cognitive workload, sand","Physical and cognitive workload factors were found to have correlation to the experienced musculoskeletal discomfort of machine operators in semi-automated hollowblock manufacturing sites – implying the importance of addressing these risk factors to achieve holistic improvements that can promote occupational safety and health during labor- intensive processes.

80,Analysis Of Factors Influencing The Usage Of Online Food  Delivery Applications Based On Utaut2 Model,"online food delivery applications are one of the fastest growing mobile applications sectors. during the pandemic, many traditional food delivery services have moved to online platforms, and there are new companies taking advantage of this opportunity to engage in online food delivery operations or move to digital platforms. this study aim to examine the relationships between variable that influences the usage of online food delivery applications by developing a conceptual model based on the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (utaut2) model with customer satisfaction and advocacy as an additional variable in our analysis. data were collected from 366 respondents using an online survey and analyzed using pls-sem. 9 hypotheses were developed, of which eight were accepted, and one were rejected. our findings can be used to help online food delivery companies to understand the factor that might influence the continuance intention of customer to the food delivery app and it will have implication for the design and marketing of these services in the indonesian market.",utaut2,"can be drawn: 1. Performance expectancy (PE) has a significant positive effect on satisfaction (SA) (Coefficient = 0.179, p < 0.05). 2. Effort expectancy (EE) has a significant positive effect on satisfaction (SA) (Coefficient = 0.260, p < 0.05). 3. Social influence (SI) does not have a significant effect on satisfaction (SA) (Coefficient = -0.026, p > 0.05). 4. Facilitating conditions (FC) has a significant positive effect on satisfaction (SA) (Coefficient = 0.146, p < 0.05). 5. Hedonic motivation (HM) has a significant positive effect on satisfaction (SA) (Coefficient = 0.208, p < 0.05). 6. Price value (PV) has a significant positive effect on satisfaction (SA) (Coefficient = 0.207, p < 0.05). 7. Habit (HA) has a significant positive effect on satisfaction (SA) (Coefficient = 0.116, p < 0.05). 8. Satisfaction (SA) has a significant positive effect on continuance intention (CI) (Coefficient = 0.585, p < 0.05). 9. Satisfaction (SA) has a significant positive effect on advocacy (AD) (Coefficient = 0.518, p < 0.05). Therefore, the hypotheses H3, H2, H1b, H1f, H1a, H1e, H1g, and H1d are accepted, indicating significant relationships between the respective variables. However, hypothesis H1c is rejected as the relationship between social influence (SI) and satisfaction (SA) is not significant. These findings provide insights into the factors that influence customer satisfaction, continuance intention, and advocacy in the context of online food delivery applications. 5.2 Graphical Results In addition, the majority of respondents in our study were graduates or bachelor degree holders, indicating a certain level of education among online food delivery application users. Furthermore, the occupation distribution shows a significant number of private employees and students among the respondents. Regarding the usage of specific online food delivery applications, Gojek emerged as the most popular choice among respondents, followed by Grab and Shopee. This highlights the dominant presence of these platforms in the online food delivery market in Indonesia. The data also revealed that the frequency of application usage varies, with a substantial portion of respondents using the application multiple times a week. This indicates a frequent and habitual use of online food delivery applications among the respondents. In terms of income, a significant portion of respondents reported having an income between 5 to 10 million rupiah, followed by an income of more than 10 million rupiah. This suggests that online food delivery applications cater to a diverse range of income levels. The average expenditure on the applications in a month was found to be relatively low, with the majority of respondents spending less than 500 thousand rupiah. This indicates that online food delivery applications offer affordability and cost-effectiveness to users. Overall, these findings paint a positive picture of the popularity, adoption, and satisfaction with online food delivery applications among consumers in Indonesia. The widespread usage and positive experiences reported by respondents emphasize 737","aditya prayudhi and zulkarnain industrial engineering department, faculty of engineering universitas indonesia, depok, west java, indonesia aditya.prayudhi11@ui.ac.id, zulkarnain17@ui.ac.id","References

Caldera et al. (2019) developed a 3P model for lean and green strategy that presents four steps for SMEs to engage in sustainable business practices. The authors conducted case studies with potential SMEs in Queensland and found that the model, which includes a 3P matrix, can guide SMEs to use the best tools and processes based on their circumstances and aspirations. The four steps include exploring, prioritizing, investing, and monitoring and evaluating. The model can be used iteratively, and senior decision makers in the case studies emphasized that it should be inspired by the PDCA cycle. The authors conclude that their model provides a useful guide for SMEs to engage in sustainable business practices and to address strategic work areas through systematic trialing and integration of tools. Table 2. highlights the key models, frameworks, and approaches discussed in this article regarding the implementation of LM in SMEs. Each model or framework is accompanied by a brief description, implementation phases or steps, and the approach used to measure the success of LM implementation.

82,Aligning Manufacturing Flow Control Techniques With The  Product-Process Matrix: A Review For Research,"many manufacturing flow control techniques (mfcts) have been proposed, and selecting an appropriate one to implement can be challenging. comparing their performances could also be tricky because, by design, many are not likely to perform similarly under different conditions. this work aggregates and maps the mfcts to a standard planning and control artefact to provide guidance on selection and implementation of the techniques. it builds on a previously published work. the hermeneutics double loop review procedure with snowballing approach was the overarching method, initiated using partial umbrella review. the product-process matrix was used as the basis for alignment of the mfcts to the manufacturing processes. mfcts were summarised into a few groups using the characteristics of the production system, products and demand pattern. mapping the groups to the product-process matrix enhances the selection of appropriate control techniques for manufacturing environments. it also helps in anticipating the performance of the techniques under specified manufacturing conditions. leading mfcts and their notable variations considered to be representative of others were selected based on literature. all variants were grouped using characteristics considered important from literature. there may be some other ways of creating the groups. the only work known to have linked the mfcts to processes was published in 1989, and there has been many new techniques and variants of existing ones since then. this work expands on this foundation to provide a more comprehensive mapping, thereby helping researchers and practitioners to achieve a more structured implementation of the techniques and compare their performances.","card-based control, kanban",,"olufemi adetunji department of industrial and systems engineering university of pretoria, pretoria 0002, south africa olufemi.adetunji@up.ac.za",
83,From The Foundational Theories To The Prospects Of The  Ddmrp: A Review And Research Agenda,"a review of the principles and techniques for manufacturing flow was made from the earlier reorder point (rop) to the demand driven materials requirement planning (ddmrp). the hermeneutics double loop review procedure was used to progressively analyse and build the body of knowledge, following a chronology of key events and challenges leading from rop to ddmrp. some key principles of the ddmrp were presented in response to some of these challenges, followed by a discussion of opportunities for research that exists in the implementation of ddmrp. findings show that there are opportunities to strengthen the theoretical underpinning of this technique rather than depending mainly on the experiential judgment of those implementing it. also, more efforts need to be invested in how to understand the similarities of the different mfc techniques so as to create a more integrated and responsive approach, rather than focusing on their differences as seems to be currently done in most research. in addition, making inventory decisions independent of extant capacity considerations (and vice versa) is unlikely to produce an optimal result, hence, the need for a more integrated approach to the planning and control of the manufacturing system. the main limitation to this research is that not all existing mfc have been reviewed, but only those that may be considered as foundational to the evolution of the ddmrp logic, hence, the motivation for the selection of the review approach as well. this can be expanded in subsequent studies, where more comparative studies can be done.","reorder point, demand driven mrp","This research traces the evolution of the major philosophies of operations management from RoP to DDMRP using the hermeneutics approach for literature review. It clarifies that the RoP logic is still very relevant as the reliable model for the estimate of Safety Stock and LT demand in all inventory management environments. It discusses organisational slacks and their relevance for stability due to demand and process variations, and their interchangeability when buffering to support material flow in a production planning environment. It emphasises that research emphasis should be on integration of the philosophies rather than differences in performance that seems to be the current focus with the superiority being flaunted based on possibly selective performance measures.

It identifies key characteristics of the philosophies that may foster their integration and suggests which areas researchers may consider to provide theoretical bases for such integration.","olufemi adetunji department of industrial and systems engineering university of pretoria, pretoria 0002, south africa olufemi.adetunji@up.ac.za",
84,The Impact Of External Business Environment On The  Performance Of Business Organization And The Moderating,"the aim of this research assessed the impact of internal business factors and the external operating environment on the performance of business organisations. the external and internal resource factors were modelled as higher-order factors, and the impact of the moderating effect of the internal business factors on the relationship between external factors and the performance of business organizations was analysed. the survey questionnaire was sent to over 380 companies. 146 responses (38 percent) were received. the data was analysed using smart pls 3. the results indicated that external resources have a direct and positive impact on the performance of business organisations and that the internal organisational resource factors have a positive moderating effect on the relationship between the external business environment and the performance of business organisations in south africa.",competitiveness,"To the best knowledge of the researcher, this is the first empirical study conducted to analyse the moderating effect of internal factors on the relationship between the external business environment factors and the performance of business organisations in a developing country, where South Africa was taken as a case study, using integrated porter’s diamond model and the RB theory factors as designed in the study’s operative model. The findings suggested that external factors, such as market demand conditions, related and supporting industries, and social capital, have a direct and positive impact on the performance of organisations. In addition, the study indicated that the internal business factors of an organisation have a direct effect on how the external factors are leveraged to drive business performance.

Technically, the increase in photovoltaic production had a beneficial impact on the system. Economically, more storage is needed because the price of the excess in our case is not taken into account. It should also be noticed that the economic parameter 𝐸𝐸𝑐𝑐 can change, especially the formula in other countries, especially with the existence of feed-in tariffs. The feed-in tariffs and net metering processes are still being developed and improved (Wonsuk et al. ,2019, Zander et al.,2021) (Rehman et al., 2020, Le et al. 2022).","meriem andam, jamila el alami, younes louartassi laboratory for system analysis, information processing, and integrated management (lastimi) high school of technology-salé, mohammed v university in rabat, morocco meriand.11@gmail.com, alamijamila1@gmail.com, younes.louartassi@um5.ac.ma rabie zine school of science and engineering, al akhawayn university in ifrane, morocco r.zine@aui.ma",

88,Fundamentals Of Quality Concept: Literature Review  Zaizoune Marouane And Khadiri Hassan,"quality is defined predominantly as one of the companies’ key processes. it’s declined on many structural levels and interacts necessarily with other functions in order to achieve the overall performance of the system. the purpose of quality management is to maintain a desired level of excellence in production and services in order to satisfy the customer. however, the concept of quality as we know it today has not been the same, it has undergone enormous changes starting with quality control and focusing today on achieving the global excellence of the company. in this context, this paper will describe the evolution of quality control as a key factor in the company and how we can transform this concept to global performance by using fuzzy logic as a new approach for reasoning and taking into account operator experience and uncertain information to describe a manufacture system and then optimize its performance in term of product quality and process reliability.",quality control,"Quality has undergone enormous changes since its appearance from the first civilities. It has moved from the pursuit of compliance to the pursuit of excellence in rapidly changing industrial fields. Quality in the company is considered as a process that fits into the different structural levels of the company. At each structural level, this process brings together a set of quality activities that take place either in the design level of this process or in its operational one. These quality activities are supported by the implementation of quality approaches, methodologies and methods which, in general, represent means to operate the activities. However, the past decade has seen significant advancements in connectivity, mobility, analytics, scalability, and data. There is even talk of the fourth industrial revolution, or industry 4.0, the industry has digitized its operations and, in doing so, transformed its efficiency, the performance of the supply chain and innovation.

92,Advancing Humanitarian Logistics Design Through  Linguistic Decision-Making Based Quality Function,"this paper proposes an innovative approach to designing effective humanitarian logistics systems based on linguistic decision-making. the authors aim to create a detailed roadmap for such systems by carefully considering the key needs that must be addressed. to accomplish this, they utilize the house of quality (hoq) method of quality function deployment (qfd), which establishes clear relationships between the various needs of humanitarian logistics and the specific requirements for designing effective systems. the inherently chaotic and complex nature of humanitarian logistics presents a significant challenge to effective design. however, the use of linguistic variables, combined with fuzzy logic-based techniques, can help to handle the vagueness and ambiguity of the field. the paper suggests using the 2-tuple linguistic (2-tl) model in combination with qfd technique to create more effective roadmaps that can be followed even in the face of uncertainty and unexpected events. this paper contributes to the existing literature by proposing a linguistic-based design approach to prioritize the design requirements for humanitarian logistics systems. this approach can guide practitioners to generate relevant strategies to address critical design requirements. the paper also presents a case study from türkiye to develop the proposed qfd models for humanitarian logistics design and provides further discussions and analysis at the end.","2-tuple linguistic, qfd",,"deployment gülçin büyüközkan professor, department of industrial engineering galatasaray university ortaköy, istanbul, turkey gbuyukozkan@gsu.edu.tr deniz uztürk department of management, business research center galatasaray university ortaköy, istanbul, turkey duzturk@gsu.edu.tr","references:

93,Embedding Social Determinants Of Health Into Ambulatory  Clinic Standard Work,"the ability of patients to successfully manage their own healthcare can have challenges outside the clinical realm. food insecurity can impact the physical and psychological state of an individual, and many patients feel the need to choose between paying for food and paying for medication. transportation to and from healthcare sites can be challenging, as delays or missed encounters for care contributing to negative clinical outcomes. these and other social determinants of health (sdoh) have a significant impact on the ability of a clinical best practice to achieve its desired outcome at the patient level. this poster strives to educate on how the university of texas medical branch is working to make the questions for sdoh a part of standard work to better identify and support those patients in need.","health, clinic, ambulatory",,"susan seidensticker and rebecca castro department of community and population health university of texas medical branch, usa smseiden@utmb.edu",
94,An Mcdm Approach To Smart Contract Adoption In Indian  Electronic Industry,"remember internet boom of 1990s and how its usage changed the way we look at world? blockchain technology (bt) is the internet of present time. studies highlighting ways to leverage the benefits of bt are being carried out aggressively and it's of keen interest for major industries and industrialists. every new research in the area indicate various benefits of bt related to performance improvements. therefore, to evaluate the enablers of blockchain adoption in smart contracts becomes essential and of great importance. for consumer driven economy like india, where implementation and adoption of bt has been sluggish, bt implementation can give strategic advantage to any industry, making it relevant to evaluate the feasibility and the importance of blockchain smart contracts in the electronic industry, which occupy a large share of the market. there are different enablers for bt adoption in different industries, and this study focuses on identifying and establishing the relationships between the enabler in the electronic supply chain. eight enablers were considered after conducting a survey of the literature before applying the interpretive structural modelling (ism) technique to understand the complex relationships between the identified enablers. the result of the detailed analysis, highlighted traceability as the most significant enabler among others for bt-related smart contract adoption for the electronic industry. this result is of immense importance for managers in identifying and developing policies and strategies related to bt implementation for the firm.","mcdm, smart contract","Supply chain contracts have been widely adopted by a large number of organisations and industry practitioners to deal with the complexities and uncertainties in the supply chain. The degree of flexibility and the required technologies to be adopted depends on a number of situations. This paper studies the enablers of blockchain to adopt smart contract for the short life cycle products. Eight enablers of blockchain that impacts smart contract adoption in the supply have been identified based on literature review and co-occurrence analysis of the corpus extracted from Scopus database. Various direct and indirect interrelationships between the enablers are identified using ISM and a hierarchical model is developed based on their driving and dependence powers. The MICMAC analysis is used along with ISM for classifying the enablers into four categories viz. autonomous, dependent, linkage and independent. A large number of enablers are positioned in the independent category as well as dependent category indicating that most of the enablers are not highly interlinked with each other. The results from the ISM can be used to identify which enablers to focus on to help in faster and smoother adoption of smart contract for the short life products. The research framework adopted in this study can be extended to other industries for future research. Different enablers can also be identified for analysing the feasibility and importance of smart contracts in the supply chains. Similar research can also be done using a combination of other MCDM techniques to support the findings of this study.","imnatila pongen and pritee ray department of operations management indian institute of management ranchi jharkhand-834008, india imnatila.pongen19ph@iimranchi.ac.in, pritee.r@iimranchi.ac.in",
95,Applications Of Federated Learning In Manufacturing:  Identifying The Challenges And Exploring The Future,"in manufacturing settings, data collection and analysis are often a time-consuming, challenging, and costly process. it also hinders the use of advanced machine learning and data-driven methods which require a substantial amount of offline training data to generate good results. it is particularly challenging for small manufacturers who do not share the resources of a large enterprise. recently, with the introduction of the internet of things (iot), data can be collected in an integrated manner across the factory in real-time, sent to the cloud for advanced analysis, and used to update the machine learning model sequentially. nevertheless, small manufacturers face two obstacles in reaping the benefits of iot: they may be unable to afford or generate enough data to operate a private cloud, and they may be hesitant to share their raw data with a public cloud. federated learning (fl) is an emerging concept of collaborative learning that can help small-scale industries address these issues and learn from each other without sacrificing their privacy. it can bring together diverse and geographically dispersed manufacturers under the same analytics umbrella to create a win-win situation. however, the widespread adoption of fl across multiple manufacturing organizations remains a significant challenge. this study aims to review the challenges and future directions of applying federated learning in the manufacturing industry, with a specific emphasis on the perspectives of industry 4.0 and 5.0.","federated learning, iot, industry 4.0, industry 5.0, cloud","With the growing availability of time-series data, the manufacturing industry is increasingly moving towards real- time and sequential learning through edge devices and the cloud (Raihan & Ahmed, 2019). However, small-scale manufacturers still do not possess the capability of collecting enough data by themselves or analyzing them in the cloud for a real-time decision. Although FL offers a potential solution to address this issue without compromising data privacy, its implementation remains rare in the manufacturing industry. In this study, we attempted to provide a discussion of FL and its potential applications across the diversified manufacturing industry. We also discussed the applications FL from the context of Industry 4.0 and Industry 5.0. Moreover, the challenges associated with adopting FL in the manufacturing industry are extensively reviewed and categorized in this work. Based on the analysis, it can be concluded that most of the challenges relate to technical readiness, including software and hardware. Therefore, the focus for future research should be on addressing these technical challenges, while simultaneously promoting a shift in organizational culture to prepare the industry for the adoption of FL and drive improved outcomes.

96,Path Optimization Of Multi-Tool Drilling Using Genetic  Algorithm,"this paper presents an improved approach to minimize tool path length in multi-tool drilling operations using a genetic algorithm. hole drilling is prevalent in manufacturing processes, particularly in computer numerical control machines. holes often vary in size, necessitating tool switches during drilling. as the number of holes and tools increases, finding the optimal path becomes an np-hard problem. the proposed approach employs genetic algorithms to optimize the tool path for both multi-tool and single-tool drilling. a comparison of the proposed method with existing techniques reveals a reduction of up to 17% in total path length, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.","path planning, optimization, genetic algorithm",,"mohamed b elnoor department of electrical and computer engineering university of maryland college park, md 20742, usa melnoor@umd.edu ebisa d wollega school of engineering colorado state university pueblo pueblo, co 81001, usa ebisa.wollega@csupueblo.edu","References

98,A Logistics Planning Tool For E-Waste Collection:  Streamlining Sustainability And Efficiency,"we have developed a vehicle routing problem (vrp) optimization tool aimed at improving the efficiency of e-waste collection and logistics systems. given the geospatial dispersion of electronic waste (e-waste), an effective reverse logistics system is crucial for successful recycling efforts. our tool combines guided local search and k-opt algorithms to optimize travel routes for fleets of heterogeneous vehicles. to ensure accurate calculations, the tool utilizes the open street map api, which provides actual road network data for calculating travel distances and time. furthermore, we have incorporated a comprehensive emission model that accurately quantifies vehicular emissions. by doing so, we can generate optimized solutions with an average optimality gap of 2.2% compared to known best solutions of benchmark vrps within a time limit of 30 seconds. it also generates an interactive map showing color-coded vehicle routes and collecting nodes’ information. the effectiveness of the tool has been tested with real data from our industry partner. out developed vrp optimization tool comes with a graphical user interface that can provide optimized routes and quantify—environmental emissions, actual travel distance, and cost within a reasonable amount of time. it has been released as an open-source software. the tool can potentially be utilized for minimizing carbon dioxide emissions from commercial vehicles to mitigate greenhouse gas impacts.","logistics, vrp, e-waste, recycling","The use of electrical and electronic devices is growing day by day and hence increasing the need for recycling. In this study, we developed a vehicle routing tool to help e-waste recycling companies establish a cost-effective collection and logistics system. The key features of the tool can be summarized below: • The tool uses real road network data for calculating travel distance and travel time as opposed to other works where a straight line or Euclidian distance has been used. This feature makes the tool suitable for practical logistics applications. • While most of the previous works utilized a constant factor for the calculation of emissions, we integrated a comprehensive emission model into the tool. The emission model considers vehicle mass, collected e-waste weight, road speed, and a wide range of vehicle attributes for accurately estimating emissions. • The tool can generate results within minutes even for large-scale problems and the quality of the solutions is satisfactory. The average optimality gap we found for the well-known benchmark problems is only 2.2%, making the tool reliable. • We tested the tool with real-world data from our partnering e-waste recycling company and included different features based on their feedback. • The tool can calculate transportation costs by considering fuel costs, driver salary, vehicle capital, and operational costs. This is useful information for the users. • One of the key features of this tool is the development of the graphical user interface. Logistics people can use the capability of the tool without any need for mathematical or programming knowledge. Previous works lack this feature. The transportation sector is responsible for the largest share of greenhouse gas emissions. Our developed route planning tool can potentially be utilized for minimizing carbon dioxide emissions from commercial vehicles and hence mitigating greenhouse gas impacts.

The model establishes a set of criteria and relevant sub-criteria for the context of the studied problem. These criteria allow the evaluation of these sites using both objective and subjective metrics, which are possible to be incorporated into the model because the AHP method can support subjective judgments, according to a scale suggested by the developer of the method, which has been widely used in recent decades. Results show the viability of the model in the sense of allowing, in a relatively simple way, to select the best online freight intermediary. The flexibility of the Expert Choice software allows you to any user to establish their individual preferences for peer-to-peer judgments, thereby inducing custom ranking solutions. 919","carlos ernani fries and fernanda christmann department of industrial and systems engineering federal university of santa catarina florianópolis, sc brazil carlos.fries@ufsc.br, fe.christmann.fc@gmail.com","References

101,Developing An Entrepreneurial Small Business’ Strategic  Plan By Shortened Systematic Strategic Planning (Ssp),"as many sources exhort managers to “think strategically,” only a few addresses how to make this happen. where strategic analysis tools are explained, this is most frequently done conceptually rather than their actual application in strategic planning. shortened systematic strategic planning (ssp) consists of a pattern of step-wise procedure for straight-forward planning, and the fundamentals involved in any strategic planning project. the use of shortened ssp is more suitable for the development of strategic plans for small- and medium-size businesses (smes). the intention here is to provide a new perspective and benefit for the strategic planners by introducing this new systematic methodology and demonstrating its implementation on an entrepreneurial and new business called cga tech. accordingly, let shortened version of ssp easily understood and universally applied to any small- and medium-size businesses. the data that are used in this case are fictitious and only help for this study. though, the given case does not cover all the sections of a typical strategic plan and use all the recommended techniques, it still reflects the basics.","strategic planning, strategy","The aim of Systematic Strategic Planning (SSP) is to force a consider the future and therefore provides an opportunity to influence the future, or assume a proactive posture, to provide better awareness of needs and environment, to help define and focus on the objectives of the organization. SSP—shortened version consists of a pattern of six steps for straight forward planning, and the three fundamentals (competitive advantages, scenarios and strategies) involved in any strategic planning project. The use of shortened SSP version is more suitable for the development of strategic plans for small- and medium-size businesses. Here, we have provided a new perspective and benefit for the strategic planners by introducing the shortened version of SSP and demonstrating its implementation on an entrepreneurial and new business called CGA Tech. This will help SSP users to easily understand and apply this new methodology to any small- and medium-size businesses’ strategic planning project. Though, the given case did not cover all the sections of a typical strategic plan and use all the recommended techniques, it still reflected the basics. Figure 9.

102,Centralized And Decentralized Organizational Structure:  The Impact On Employee Satisfaction And Performance,"the topic of this paper is team-based work structures: hierarchical decision-making authority in an organization. the research question is: “how is employee satisfaction, behavior, and performance impacted by a decentralized vs. that of centralized structure of an organization?” within this research, the goal of the paper will be to explore the positive and negative factors of an organization where a top-down approach to decisions and operating procedure are in place compared to an organization design where the teams are given latitude to formulate plans and carry out project deliverables based on expertise and collaboration. decentralized compared to that of a centralized structure of an organization is researched and aspects of employee satisfaction and the impact on individual and organizational performance are analyzed.","decentralized, centralized, organization","On the surface, it seems that decentralization may be the choice for achieving the highest employee satisfaction that would influence desired performance. However, as different needs drive strategy of organizational structure, so does the requirement to consider different levels of integrating decentralized forms of business units even at times within a centralized governance model (Andrews et al., 2009). This literature review was aimed at better understanding centralized vs. decentralized organizational models and corresponding employee satisfaction, behaviors, and performance in each. Eight different industries including automotive, construction, government public sectors, healthcare, industrial equipment, private firms across an entire country, shipping ports, and technology were reviewed and the countries of Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, Denmark, Japan, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, and the United States were represented on topics in this paper. It has been learned through this study that decentralization does increase autonomy, allow better input to the decision- making process, and contribute to higher levels of employee satisfaction (Stuart, 1984). Performance, however, is more complex. As mentioned, it depends on the needs of the company and is closely related to the strategy of carefully structuring an effective plan of centralization, decentralization, or a combination thereof (Chen & Eriksson, 2019). 4. Implications and Limitations 4.1 What are the implications of the findings? Although decentralization is found to be an important ingredient in engaging the employee into the decision-making process, it is management that must be proactive in coming to an agreement of what the effective strategy in which the company will operate. Maybe the entity operates in a government public sector, healthcare, or industrial equipment industry where some centralization is needed, yet creative solutions can be established for maximizing employee and stakeholder input at the department level. Maybe it is a stand-alone manufacturing facility, individual private firm, or construction site where leadership has the flexibility to maximize the expertise and innovation of the workforce through a highly decentralized governance model. Lastly, it is learned that a hybrid of centralized combined with decentralized business units like that in examples discussed in the paper of a shipping port, or technology company is possible. 4.2 What are the limitations of this study? Although several industries and countries of economy were explored, it is acknowledged that this paper took a sample of what is available across all industries and the global economy. A deeper study looking at all continents, cultures, norms, and performance measurements would paint a more complete picture of how strategy of structuring an organization leads to high levels of employee satisfaction and how performance is impacted. 4.3 Can the findings be generalized? The findings in the paper are difficult to generalize. As Frederick Herzberg’s two-factor theory suggests, it would be a risk to generalize the factors for what influences employee satisfaction and eventual performance as it relates to either centralized or decentralized governance model (Stuart, 1984). It is therefore important for any leader to recognize the needs of the organization, team members, and engage the workforce in ways that are consistent with company cultural norms and consistency to succeed within the strategic organizational structure.

104,A Policy For The Conservation Of Bara Katra In The Old  Dhaka Industrial Area,"a medieval caravanserai called ""bara katra"" has been found in ancient dhaka, bangladesh. the historic monument bara katra's momentous cultural identity is a hallmark of dhaka, still standing today and crying for proper conservation attention. it stands for social value, artistic beauty, emotional value, and the architectural history of bangladesh. the history of the old dhaka, both industrial and architectural, has become better known. in addition to the various state efforts, populous stakeholders in bangladesh have come forward with concern for the preservation and restoration of monuments and historic sites. the initiatives have been designed to conserve bangladesh's ancient heritage and culture for future generations. the artifact bara katra, which was the most magnificent architecture during the mughal era, is deteriorating and has experienced numerous unintended adjustments over the years. the majority of the building's components have been demolished, except its southern wing. as a response, it requires special attention to take the necessary actions to preserve its heritage and cultural value for the civilization that values its legacy and cares about future concerns. due to old dhaka's extensive ancient narrative, there are many opportunities to promote cultural tourism and tourist attractions in this neighborhood. this paper aims to demonstrate a conservation management plan technique with potential recommendations for bara katra, including necessary measures and adaptive reuse. the management policy likewise involves collaboration with the relevant authorities for conservation.","bara katra 2, heritage 3","Bara Katra is the heart of the significant Chawk Bazar of old Dhaka, an area of special cultural value and significance. As a reflection of Mughal architecture, this unique building has undoubtedly made a profound contribution to the socio-cultural history and heritage of Bangladesh, which has created a strong and glorious image of the past. Currently, this historic monument in old Dhaka is trying to survive in the face of rapid development of the city, immoral use and negligence. In order to attain sustainable development of this site, an implementing conservation management plan (CMP) and a decision must be taken to conserve and manage the artifact, that is holistic approaches to revitalization of Bara Katra that consider social, economic and cultural revitalization with physical revitalization together be developed. In this context, the authors proposed a comprehensive contextual action plan with management policies for the architectural conservation of the historical building with respect to the values of the building with documentation and assessment.

107,Factors Affecting The Consumers’ Willingness To Pay For  Sustainable Fashion Products (Study Case: Natural Dyed,"due to globalization and the fast upkeep with fashion trends, the number of imported cheap textile products and fast fashion products are increasing in developing countries especially in indonesia. this can suppress the development of local industries that are oriented towards green products. lately, many indonesian fashion industries are starting to apply sustainable concepts and some of them are in the batik sector. natural dyed batik production process goes through several stages, in which overall need a long coloring process and expensive costs. this what makes natural dyed batik is relatively more expensive than the synthetic dyed batik as well as other types of fashion. the issue of consumers' willingness to pay for environmentally friendly products has begun to be widely discussed in research, especially in relation to the existence of eco-friendly fashion industries. this research primarily aims to identify the factors that influence consumers to buy environmentally friendly products. the method used is a review of literature studies related to the context of eco-friendly textile products. the findings of this study revealed that there are six factors that influence consumers' willingness to pay for natural dyed batik products, such as value orientation, cognitive knowledge, aesthetics, demographics, attitude towards green products, and green purchase intention.","literature review, natural dye batik","Based on the literature review that has been done, it can be concluded that many studies have proven that demographic, cognitive knowledge, and value orientation are significantly related to willingness to pay. However, there are not many studies that include aesthetics as a variable, when aesthetics is one of the most important aspects of sustainable fashion since it plays a crucial role in attracting consumers. Sustainable fashion or natural dyed batik is frequently seen as dull or unappealing compared to the other types of batik, and buyers may be reluctant to buy eco-friendly options if they do not feel aesthetically satisfied. If natural dyed batik can offer aesthetically pleasing and trendy options, buyers are more likely to switch to sustainable and eco-friendly fashion. Therefore, aesthetic is essential in creating natural dyed batik that is both attractive and long-lasting. From the results and discussion that has been conducted, that there has not been much research discussing natural dyed batik products. Then further research is needed to discuss consumers' willingness to pay related to natural dyed batik as a form of support for authentic Indonesian sustainable fashion products, with the hypotheses and the research model that have been obtained in this study.","batik) almira zana pratama master program of industrial engineering department, faculty of engineering universitas sebelas maret surakarta, indonesia almirazp@student.uns.ac.id eko liquiddanu industrial engineering department, faculty of engineering universitas sebelas maret surakarta, indonesia ekoliquiddanu@staff.uns.ac.id eko pujiyanto industrial engineering department, faculty of engineering universitas sebelas maret surakarta, indonesia ekopujiyanto@ft.uns.ac.id",

These goals must be integrated into one goal: safety through training. Goals focusing on backing up incident reduction and goals focused on how to train employees to meet these reduction goals are vital. These goals should be lofty and are necessary, but also need to be realistic. Proper training of employees on the implementation and utilization of back up cameras and standard operating procedures will reduce the incident rate.

109,Internal Logistics Improvement Of Automotive Parts In An  Assembly Plant,"overprocessing in the internal logistics of an automotive assembly plant occurs in the part sorting process identified at two sorting levels: the first level involves forklift drivers sorting parts at the skid level. in contrast, the second level entailed operators manually sorting box parts by assembly line addresses which supply by electronic car drivers via limited electronic cars and fixed routes that are unstable workloads and are inoperative under cycle time. this paper provided an approach to redesign internal routes with the google operation research tools (or-tools) to optimize route grouping for a balanced workload under cycle time. the simulation technique is applied to evaluate the performance of electronic car loaded capacity utilization and working under cycle time. the consequence of the calculation is the new route supply, which requires two modifications, i.e., to assign suppliers to allocate the parts boxes on the skid at a ratio of 1 skid per 1 new route to eliminate the manual box sorting process and to design the layout in transfer areas by new route for using the automatic guided vehicle (agv) system that instead of box parts sorting worker with lean manufacturing principles. the work finally concludes with a summary and outlook for the future.","internal logistics, automotive parts, assembly plant, or-tools","This paper presented a four-step implementation approach to eliminate overprocessing in the manual box sorting process. It has been identified that there is a need to improve the cooperation between departments, particularly between the production planning and the parts planning department. These two departments are responsible for managing the automobile parts ordering for the assembly plant, which is directly affected. The assembly plant must design a new electronic car route to supply parts to assembly line addresses to address this issue. To develop a new route supply per skid sent to the part planning department to coordinate with the supplier to arrange box parts on skids as specified by the assembly plant. The proposed approach can eliminate the manual sorting process at the part box level. All departments must agree to this requirement together. New internal route data needs to be added in part ordering data. It will impact multiple departments, particularly the suppliers, who need to adjust their operations. We recommended studying the effect on each department and implementing a pilot phase to lead to a smoother transition and better overall outcomes. The simulation results confirm the feasibility of the new internal route that works under cycle time. Workload balance is efficient in routes, mainly when calculating based on volume demands. The electronic car-loaded capacity utilization is significant for evaluation. In conclusion, balancing the workload in each route is essential for optimal electronic car-loaded capacity utilization. We need to understand the current situation before operation improvement. In this case, the study parts condition is managed by another department. We consider internal factors regarding the assembly plant in the current situation. The assembly plant needs to eliminate a manual box sorting process and change direct supply to lineside if we have a precise requirement. We can generate ideas for improvement. 1011","patipath maneerath master of engineering program in industrial engineering chulalongkorn university bangkok 10330, thailand patipath.m@outlook.com","References

110,Using Machine Learning To Risk Prediction As Safety Risk  Management Implementation In Aircraft Maintenance,"machine learning has been successfully applied to different fields, including aviation industry. there is a large amount of knowledge and data accumulation in the aviation industry which divided into reactive and proactive method in safety risk management concept. nowadays, those groups of data are collected as safety data and are used to predictive approach where potential unsafe events and precursors are identified beforehand, and mitigation strategies are implemented to prevent incident/accident. this study aims to predict incident/accident events on aircraft in the mro industry based on investigation event data so that mitigation can be carried out to reduce the impact of aircraft damage and even prevent more fatal things from occurring. from the prediction model built, it is hoped that the factors or variables that can determine the risk index category in an incident/accident event can also be identified. the processing data using several algorithms namely svm, naïve bayes, decision tree, and random forest. the accuracy results are random forest (94.29%), decision tree (91.43%), naïve bayes (91.43%) and svm (83%).","machine learning, risk prediction","In this paper, an aviation maintenance safety risk prediction model based on incident/accident investigation event database is proposed to build safety risk prediction for improving the learning accuracy of sample safety data. The processing data using several algorithms namely SVM, Naïve Bayes, Decision Tree, and Random Forest. The highest accuracy value is 94.29% using random forest. The second is using decision tree with accuracy 91.43%, then followed by naïve bayes with value 91.43%. The lowest accuracy value is 83% using SVM. Due to random forest having the highest accuracy, it is indicating that random forest has excellent generalization ability and can effectively predict the risk index using incident/accident investigation database with small amount of samples. Further research on data processing using different or ensemble algorithms is needed to achieve better accuracy for risk reduction, because the predictions made in this category of risk index are more accurate based on the results obtained. Also, having sufficient safety data may affect the accuracy of safety prediction. In addition, prediction modeling cannot only use safety data from investigation results but can use other safety data such as audit results, surveillance results, occurrence reports, and others.","industry nur laily haryanti and komarudin department of industrial engineering, faculty of engineering university of indonesia depok, west java, indonesia nur.laily11@ui.ac.id, komarudin@ui.ac.id",
111,A Robust Hybrid Anfis-Wavelet Approach For Pattern  Recognition,"lately, accurate recognition of process control chart patterns (ccps) has been considered one of the significant tactics for supervising manufacturing processes in order to achieve better control and to improve products quality. in addition to the single patterns, a huge work has been done to recognize concurrent ones that are usually due to the presence of two or more single patterns. feature-based approaches are more efficient in pattern recognition especially in the case of concurrent patterns. furthermore, a selection of an optimal set of features can significantly reduce the diagnostic search process. in this paper, a new approach based on a combination of adaptive neuro‑fuzzy inference system (anfis), wavelet analysis (wa) and principal components analysis (pca) is used to recognize concurrent patterns anfis has proven to show high accuracy in pattern recognition. wa is used in this paper to improve the characteristics of the patterns to facilitate the recognition process by adding frequency features to the original pattern. then, thirteen statistical features are extracted and pca reduces their number to the most important three. anfis is used for training and testing the data based on the three extracted features as inputs and the patterns as target outputs. extensive performance evaluation was carried out under normally and various non-normally distributed data. the non-normality of the inputs is based on two gamma and beta distributions. results indicate that the proposed approach performs with high accuracy even in the case of non-normally distributed patterns.","pattern recognition, wavelet analysis","Due to the importance of statistical process control charts and their essential role in monitoring and controlling the quality of a manufacturing process, it is necessary to develop better methods to recognize accurately abnormalities and irregular patterns in the process. In this research we focused mainly on concurrent patterns due to the difficulty in detecting them by many approaches. This difficulty lies in non-stationarity behavior of these patterns which increases the difficulties of detection. In that respect we proposed to use Haar wavelet transform and use signal frequency characteristics with some selected statistical and shape features along with wavelet coefficients energy as input to the ANFIS classifier. In this approach, statistical and shape features of the input data were selected using PCA and their robustness was tested for different random distributions. Based on the results obtained, we can conclude that this classifier provides better results with concurrent CCPs. The combination of statistical, shape and frequency features with wavelet energy assures high accuracy and consistency in detecting concurrent patterns over different random distributions. The use of PCA to reduce the number of features not only reduced ANFIS complexity, it also improved accuracy of the classifier. In future work, we will verify the performance of this approach with real manufacturing processes. In addition, further work will take place to evaluate the effectiveness of the neuro-fuzzy approach to statistical control chart pattern recognition for concurrent patterns containing more than one unnatural pattern, such as stratification and increasing trend. mean APM MAD Energy Coordinate Value Normal+Normal Normal+Cyclic Normal+Systematic 1043","adil akaaboune school of business and administration al akhawayn university, ifrane, morocco a.akaaboune@aui.ma","References

Despite the advances made in the lab, the number of successfully completed large-scale efforts is still quite low. One of the main issues with this technology is the lack of standardization in terms of material combinations, equipment, and essential features. • For successful 3D printing of concrete, the mixture should satisfy physical, rheological, and mechanical properties. These properties can be satisfied by making the mixture extrudable, buildable, flowable, open time, optimum strength, and strong adhesion. • The choice of material, material strength, and interlayer bonding all affect the way 3D printed concrete conducts heat. The increased air concentration in foaming agent material mixes results in better heat resistance. The printed wall or structure, however, fails the thermal test because of the gaps in the layers if the interlayer connection is weak. • Creating the ideal mixture for 3D printing is a huge challenge that depends on taking into consideration a number of factors, including strength, rheology, and thermal properties. If this technology is used to its maximum capacity, it might drastically reduce risks and costs associated with the construction industry while speeding up projects. • Researchers undertook several tests to create a combination distinct from conventional concrete compositions. Researchers introduced or eliminated components like retarders, superplasticizers, additives, etc. depending on the desired qualities. Many researchers have also looked at creating 3D printing mixtures utilizing building debris. Despite studying several mixes, it is challenging to identify the one perfect composition. Every mixture fits the conditions of the experiment and fails for others. Therefore, standardization is essential to knowing the optimum needed features and materials.","amaal al shenawa and poonam mahadev karoti construction management department college of architecture and construction management kennesaw state university marietta, ga aalshena@kennesaw.edu; pkaroti@student.kennesaw.edu",

114,Crispr Solution To Cure Acute Myeloid Leukemia Shrinidhi Kulkarni,"leukemia is a type of cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow, the spongy tissue inside bones where blood cells are produced. in leukemia, there is an overproduction of abnormal white blood cells, which are produced in the bone marrow and accumulate in the blood, disrupting normal blood function. the abnormal white blood cells, called leukemic cells, are unable to perform their usual function of fighting infections and protecting the body from diseases, and instead, they crowd out healthy white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets, leading to anemia, infections, and bleeding. there are several types of leukemia, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia (all), acute myeloid leukemia (aml), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (cll), and chronic myeloid leukemia (cml). all and aml affect immature white blood cells that have not fully developed, while cll and cml affect mature white blood cells that have developed more fully. all is more common in children, while aml is more common in adults. leukemia can be acute or chronic, depending on how quickly the disease develops and progresses. in acute leukemia, the abnormal white blood cells multiply rapidly, and the disease progresses quickly, sometimes over a matter of weeks or months. acute leukemia requires immediate treatment because the uncontrolled growth of leukemic cells can quickly lead to life-threatening complications. in chronic leukemia, the disease develops slowly, sometimes over many years, and the abnormal white blood cells accumulate gradually. chronic leukemia may not cause symptoms for a long time, and it may be discovered incidentally during a routine blood test. acute leukemia is identified by the rapid proliferation of immature, abnormal white blood cells in the bone marrow and blood. in contrast, chronic leukemia is identified by the accumulation of mature, abnormal white blood cells in the blood and bone marrow. the exact cause of leukemia is unknown, but several factors may increase the risk of developing the disease. these factors include exposure to radiation, certain chemicals, and viruses such as the human t-cell leukemia virus (htlv- 1) and the epstein-barr virus (ebv). genetic factors may also play a role in the development of leukemia, as some types of the disease are more common in families. the symptoms of leukemia can vary depending on the type of leukemia and the stage of the disease. common symptoms include fatigue, weakness, fever, night sweats, weight loss, and frequent infections. other symptoms may include bone pain, swollen lymph nodes, and easy bruising or bleeding. diagnosis of leukemia usually involves a physical examination, blood tests, and a bone marrow biopsy. in a bone marrow biopsy, a small sample of bone marrow is removed and examined under a microscope for abnormal cells. additional tests, such as imaging studies, may also be performed to determine the extent of the disease. treatment for leukemia depends on the type of leukemia, the stage of the disease, and the age and overall health of the patient. treatment options may include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, stem cell transplantation, or targeted therapy. chemotherapy involves the use of drugs to kill cancer cells, while radiation therapy uses high-energy radiation to destroy cancer cells. stem cell transplantation involves replacing damaged bone marrow with healthy stem cells from a donor. targeted therapy involves the use of drugs that target specific proteins or genes that are involved in the growth and spread of cancer cells. acute leukemia is generally more difficult to treat than chronic leukemia, and the prognosis for advanced stages of the disease is generally poorer. however, advances in the treatment of leukemia have led to improved survival rates in recent years. in conclusion, leukemia is a type of cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow. it is characterized by the uncontrolled growth of abnormal white blood cells, which interfere with the normal functioning of the immune system. the exact cause of leukemia is unknown, but several factors may increase the risk of developing the disease. treatment for leukemia depends on the type of leukemia, the stage of the disease, and the age and overall health of the patient. while leukemia can be a serious and life-threatening disease, advances in treatment have led to improved 1060",,", CRISPR is a powerful gene-editing technology that has the potential to revolutionize medicine, agriculture, and many other fields. Its ability to precisely and efficiently edit the genome has opened up new possibilities for targeted therapies and genetic engineering. However, its use also raises important ethical and safety concerns that must be carefully considered and addressed. Solution. In CRISPR gene editing, a CRISPR solution refers to the combination of the Cas9 enzyme and a guide RNA (gRNA) that is used to target a specific sequence of DNA for editing. The CRISPR solution is delivered into cells, where it can introduce changes to the genome, such as deleting or adding genes, altering the expression of genes, or correcting genetic mutations that cause disease. The CRISPR solution is typically created by combining the Cas9 enzyme with a custom-designed guide RNA that is complementary to the DNA sequence to be targeted. The guide RNA is designed using computational tools to ensure specificity and avoid off-target effects. One of the challenges in developing a CRISPR solution is ensuring that the guide RNA is specific enough to target the desired DNA sequence without binding to other, unintended sequences in the genome. To address this challenge, researchers use computational tools to predict potential off-target sites and experimental methods to assess the specificity of the CRISPR system.

Out of which Islamic banking, which is one of the major ingredients, includes green banking, can actively contribute to sustainable development in emerging economies. Islamic banking is becoming more popular, which benefits sustainable development and environmental conservation. Unplanned city growth, deforestation, hill tract excavating, natural disasters, and deregulation are all contributing to daily social structural changes that are becoming increasingly noticeable. These elements have been placing greater demands on a nation's ecosystem, which has seriously hampered sustainable growth. In order for the environment to stay in a sustainable state and for civilization to be safe from environmental dangers, banks should be severe about their borrowers' adherence to environmental protection standards. Islamic banks favor green banking as a conformity to ""Shari'ah."" Green banking has a stronger relationship to Islam since it upholds the principles of green banking, including social responsibility, cleanliness, reducing resource waste, and upholding ethics (Masukujjaman, 2016). Islamic banks are closely adhering to the principles of green banking. The state of green banking found that it is prerequisite for Islamic banking. It is clear that the primary barriers to green banking practices are ignorance, a lack of understanding, green risk, etc. Some specific recommendations for Islamic banking. It should practice green banking both internally and externally to safeguard the environment for sustainable growth. Few actions are essential have been taken by stakeholders: First, the scheduled and Islamic banks should be offer comprehensive green banking services to their clients in order to promote sustainable development. Through seminars, symposiums, and training programmes, Islamic banks should raise awareness of green banking among their employees and clients. Third, the Islamic Bank should set up short courses, diploma programmes, and training programmes on green banking to educate officials of scheduled banks on the subject.

116,Proceeding Of The 8Th North American International Conference On Industrial Engineering And Operations  Indian Management: New Routes To Corporate Culture,"this research paper focuses on the fact that despite learning so many management theories from usa, japan and other developed countries we in india continue to face problems in running our institutions and organisations. the problems manifest through gherao, lockouts, labour agitations, pen down strikes, go slow movements and finally sick industries knocking doors of bifr. why can’t the indian goods compete in the global markets? we often find the managers blame their own team members: they are laggards, irresponsible and disobedient. is it really true or we are following outdated theories and ideas in managing people? behavioural psychology is an integral element of management science. while we teach american and japanese methods at our business schools and universities what is it that we have done to evolve the indian method or system? the author is of the opinion that understanding the indian behaviour and ethos will help us to come out with an approach and right kind of management style to create harmony and industrial peace. through this research paper the author has tried to establish relevance of indian management recognising the influence of cultural approach. besides, the author could articulate and recognise the varied and diverse thoughts and thinkers on indian management. the article revolve around evidences where indian management concepts really works and has been shaping the world for thousands of years.","indian management, ethos, spirituality, models","that workers are intelligent enough to monitor a project or a job . However the question is how could Swami Someswarananda and team achieved it ? They tried to discover the salient features of vedantic principles starting from “Aham Brahmasmi” Thereafter they could churn out more ideas from Gita and karma yoga and put these all in a system. (Swami Someswarananda, 1998). One of the areas of Management better known as Job enrichment is another debatable concept while Herzberg has already propounded it with Herzberg’s hygiene factor and is accepted by the corporations. Can I always get a job of my liking? Shall I have to depend always on external stimuli to get myself motivated from time to time? While Transactional Analysis has its own justifications do i always require positive strokes? If I have to depend on positive strokes, it will make me psychologically dependent. This is where Vedanta comes in and talks about “mind enrichment”. The million dollar question is “can I make any job whatever I do, interesting? And that is karma yoga. Let us agree this is what a homemaker practices unknowingly. Another area that draws our attention is the modern day corporate training programmes. Majority of the training initiatives revolve around preparing a performance oriented employee and manager. The focus is to churn out skilled managers and executives who would be the future ready and market ready leaders. The issue is that in all these Management Development Programs the participants are considered as Managers and Executives only. The facilitator rarely understands that the participant is also a parent, a friend, a relative and above all a citizen. If a training program is to be unified, systematic, comprehensive and integrated then there is a need for all these aspects to be integrated .Else it will remain one sided. From the teachings of Vedanta we have come to know about the concept of ‘advaita’ that suggests us to see the person in totality. Emotional Intelligence of late has gained lot of popularity. The theme is to give importance not only to the intellect but also to the emotions, values, beliefs and actions. The roots of the same can be traced through Vedanta that suggests the path of jnana, bhakti and karma. To be successful one need to coordinate the intellect (jnana), emotions (bhakti) and action( karma). From Indian Management perspectives in training programs one must involve the participants in discussions ( this help them to grow intellectually and be creative) , next step is to adopt techniques of meditation to translate the intellectual concept into the feeling level and to remove the mental blocks. Finally, the action steps. Thus 1081","nilanka chatterjee universal business school karjat, india nilanka.chatterjee@ubs.org.in","References

117,Applications Of Artificial Intelligence Algorithms In Wind  Speed,"wind energy plays a crucial component in the contest to fulfill environmental control objectives. wind energy, on the other hand, will only be able to fulfill its essential importance if the wind turbines work efficiently. the paper aims to analyze the application of artificial intelligence (ai) algorithms in wind speed. in this paper, three network parameter optimization algorithms, adagrad, rmsprop, and adam, are implemented and compared in the context of wind speed forecasting. this paper employs wind speed data obtained from the jeddah al jazeera database in saudi arabia. mean absolute error (mae), mean square error (mse), root mean square error (rmse), and r-squared are the four metrics used to assess performance. the experiment results show that the adam algorithm outperforms the other optimization algorithms regarding forecasting accuracy and training time. therefore, researchers can use this study to help them choose optimization algorithms for wind energy forecasting.","wind energy, training","The machine learning concept, as well as artificial intelligence principles, are discussed in this report. The above concept was implemented using Python from Google Colab. The average wind speed database for Jeddah Al Jazeera has been characterized and analyzed using Adagrad, RMSprop, and Adam optimizers over 100, 500, and 1000 epochs with training percentages of 70%, 80%, and 90%. Based on the results, hypotheses of a relationship between the number of epochs and training percentage and MSE, MAE, RMSE, and R-Squared have been generated and demonstrated to be declined by evaluating the present database and adjusting it to do sensitivity analysis. The combination of Adam optimizer through 100 epochs with 90% training has proved to be the best analyzer in this sample. However, it is recommended to test this database on a more significant percentage of training to improve the results.","raghad alkhamis and nuha aloud industrial engineering department, college of engineering, princess nourah bint abdulrahman university, riyadh, ksa ali alarjani industrial engineering department, college of engineering, prince sattam bin abdulaziz university, alkharj, ksa a.alarjani@psau.edu.sa",
118,Improvement Of The Internal Audit Planning System In An  It Company Through Predictive Analytics,"internal auditing is a fundamental process for quality assurance and compliance of processes within a company. for this reason, it is very important that companies can adequately plan its execution. one of the most important aspects to consider for effective planning is the calculation of the estimated time it takes to execute the audits. this project proposes the use of machine learning to develop a model that can predict the effort time (referred to as actual effort) that is required to carry out a certain number of audits in a period of two weeks (referred to as sprint) in an information technology services company. in the early stages of the project, it was intended to develop an algorithm that predicts the actual effort for a single audit, but due to inefficient results, the approach of predicting the actual effort per sprint was preferred. many types of models were implemented along the project and various evaluation metrics, such as coefficient of determination (r²), symmetric mean absolute percentage error (smape), and others, were evaluated. the best results were obtained by an etr model where an r² of 96% and a smape of 8.47% were obtained.","audit planning, effort, prediction model","Throughout this project, different models were run to forecast the hours of effort required for audit planning in a sprint.

120,Application Of Balanced Scorecard Method In Measuring  Halal Frozen Food Supply Chain Performance,"as one of the countries with the largest muslim population in the world, indonesia is a very attractive market for the halal food industry. according to the global islamic economy indicator in the state of the global islamic economy (sgie) report in 2022, indonesia is ranked fourth in the number of halal food consumption. the halal status of the product must be guaranteed from the source of raw materials until the product received by consumers. this research was conducted at a small business that produces halal frozen food which has been measuring its performance only based on financial aspects. this study aims to determine the value of business performance using 4 aspects with the 1125",,"The conclusions obtained from the results of this study are: 1. Based on the results of performance calculations using the Balanced Scorecard and AHP methods, the frozen food business performance value is 73.653 which is categorized as having good performance. 2. Based on the Key Performance Indicator (KPI) grouping using the Traffic Light System, there are 6 KPIs that are categorized as red, namely business income, sales growth, percentage of sharia banking, number of complaints, new customers, and training and education about SJH. KPIs that are categorized as red mean that they require improvement because they have poor performance. 3. Proposed improvements that can be given to improve performance indicators in the frozen food business are: a. Participate in training in order to increase sales growth b. Be more sensitive and understand the desires of customers c. Maximize digital marketing more because 90% of products are sold thanks to marketing through digital marketing d. Owners can use Islamic banks to avoid usury. e. During the packing process, employees must be more careful when checking and separating defective products from good products. f. Provide internal training and education regarding the Halal Assurance System (SJH) g. Make promotions and provide rewards to maintain consumer loyalty. h.

121,Predicting Steel Plate Fault Detection By Metaheuristicoptimized Multi-Level Classification Machine Learning,"steel plate fault detection is a vital material science problem and getting popular in mechanical engineering because of less cost and time. this study investigated a bio-inspired hybrid intelligence model that integrated an enhanced firefly algorithm (fa) with a least squares support vector machine (lssvm) algorithm and decomposition to improve its predictive accuracy in classifying steel plate faults detection. the goal is to investigate the multiclass classification problem and propose an efficient method. the proposed model integrates the fa, metaheuristic intelligence, decomposition approaches, the one-against-one, and the lssvm. this investigation uses a multi-class case in civil engineering - steel plate faults detection - to verify the model’s effectiveness. in the steel industry, creating different defective products can impose a high cost for steel product manufacturers and result in failure risk for mechanical engineers. moreover, an effective method to determine fault types will reduce maintenance costs and unexpected waste and improve the product's quality level. thus, classifying the diagnosis of faults in steel plates plays a critical role in industrial production. based on the provided data, the analytical results confirm that the proposed model has 91.085% predictive accuracy. to verify the applicability and efficiency of the proposed model, its predictive performance was compared to other multi-classification models and prior studies concerning the accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. the proposed model exhibited higher predictive accuracy than the experimental and other single multi-class models. therefore, the proposed bio- inspired hybrid model can be a promising tool in solving classification problems for the steel industry and mechanical engineering.",machine learning,,"jui-sheng chou chair professor and dean for general affairs, national taiwan university of science and technology, taipei, taiwan trang thi phuong pham graduate research assistant, national taiwan university of science and technology, taipei, taiwan jschou@mail.ntust.edu.tw, trangpham3112@gmail.com",
122,Applying Lean Thinking To Improve Processes In The  Trucking Industry,"manufacturing businesses that use complex production systems face major challenges in establishing an efficient procedure to maximize throughput. such businesses would need a significant number of workers and process improvement resources to sustain expansion and offer high-quality products to their consumers. this can only be accomplished by implementing a chain of value-added activities built with the help of lean-based techniques capable of producing highly efficient processes. to that purpose, this research was done, and lean manufacturing-based value- added procedures were established on the shop floor. the study concentrated on conventional truck body manufacturing company called delta-waseca that have been dealing with concerns including low production rates, lengthy lead times, problems with material flow, nonlinear layout, delayed client deliveries, and poor quality. a methodology was developed that involved applying process improvement techniques to workstations with low efficiency. utilizing a variety of methods, including time analysis, motion analysis, standard working procedures (swp), value stream analysis, 5s, value layout, and bottleneck analysis, the research and implementation were carried out in key bottleneck regions. production rates, quality, and customer service have all significantly improved because of the value-added process deployment. with the new procedure in place, the production rate grew to three trucks per day from the previous average of two trucks per day.","time analysis, lean manufacturing, value stream","The study results were implemented on the production floor using lean thinking. Production floor workers played an important role by conducting kaizen events and extracting tribal knowledge, which helped the team identify bottlenecks in the process.

All design and process changes were subject to a standard verification process, and changes were recorded in engineering change notices prior to approval. Implementing process changes with lean thinking has helped the organization significantly, and the entire team's participation from the managerial level to the floor labor level has made the changes much easier. Small projects were targeted initially, and major process changes were carried out once the projects were successful and team members were more confident. To sustain the lean culture, daily meetings are conducted to discuss the production process and scheduling for 20 to 30 minutes with the leads and workers. These meetings have led to leadership development for some floor workers who have started to lead projects in the absence of a supervisor or floor manager. All employees constantly strive to reduce lead time and increase product quality by bringing more change on the floor. Delta Waseca invests heavily in the lean process implementation along with the integration of new technologies to build superior quality products in the trucking industry.","abhiram reddy ramasahayam, kuldeep agarwal and naim islam department of automotive and manufacturing engineering technology minnesota state university mankato, mn 56001, usa kuldeep.agarwal@mnsu.edu, naim.islam@mnsu.edu",

125,Proceeding Of The 8Th North American International Conference On Industrial Engineering And Operations  Visual Inspection System Using Image Sensor In,"quality inspection is a very important aspect of manufacturing industries. it satisfies some important objectives of manufacturing industries such as decreasing human labour, during subjective judgment destruction of human error, increasing overall profit of the industry and improved quality of the workpiece. to overcome the constraints of conventional inspection system which were very time consuming and lengthy and cost effective; quality inspection using image based sensor is the system for getting maximum product quality in such lesser time. in this paper we focus on quality inspection using image sensor. we will be focusing on how image based sensor inspection is a very efficient solution for conventional non-efficient inspection systems. the results will offer an overview different approaches of visual inspection using image based sensor, its perks and constraints and specific applications in manufacturing industry.","visual inspection, quality inspection, image sensor, industry 4.0","Clearly, during the past ten years, quality control has seen significant advancement. As a result of the fact that machine can only be as intelligent as the human who designed them, a large body of study on the fourth industrial revolution came to the conclusion that human inspector should be replaced with visual inspector. High levels of weariness are brought on by repetitive tasks, particularly those that demand a great deal of attention to detail. This results in a faster decline in a human operator's cognitive abilities (Lughofer et al, 2009). The emphasis of industry 4.0 is on automated system that simplify an operator's job and increase its dependability. It is evident that the research community is making a concentrated effort to develop fully AI methods for product inspection (Huang et al. 2015). Although automation is a goal in this area, there is still room for significant advancement. Industry 4.0 and automation are intertwined, but there is a narrow line between them that needs to be handled with greater caution. It is obvious that industry 4.0 has fostered the development of automated processes based on the aforementioned data, which show that the majority of study designs used human operators. Consequently, there has been an increase in the application of visual inspection systems to modify image-based inspection and control (Shen et al, 2012, Manish et al. 2018, Manzano et al. 2020). To wrap up the discussion, I would like to mention that to maintain product quality and lower manufacturing costs, the visual inspection system utilising image sensor has become a crucial instrument in the manufacturing sector. The system can function at fast rates and is capable of detecting flaws like cracks, scratches, and dents that are not visible to the human eye, making it an effective quality control method. The system has become even more dependable and efficient as a result of improvements in image sensor technology, Which have increased accuracy, resolution, and speed. There are still issues to be resolved, such as image analysis algorithms and system integration with other manufacturing processes, despite the technology's many advantages. Generally speaking, the visual inspection system incorporating image sensors is a significant and promising technology that can greatly enhance the manufacturing process.","manufacturing industry nisarg ishvarbhai patel department of mechanical engineering, school of technology, pandit deendayal energy university, gandhinagar, gujarat dr.m.b.kiran associate professor department of mechanical engineering, school of technology, pandit deendayal energy university gandhinagar, gujarat",
126,Automatic Process Control Valves In Floating Dry Docks  Soham Kewalramani,ballasting and de-ballasting of water are the key operations in working of a floating dry dock in order to dock and undock a water vessel in the yard. these operations involve pumping of sea water from sea chests to their respective ballast tanks through pumps. since these ballast tanks are present throughout the dock the filling time for each tank is different. due to this reason filling of tanks with same water flow rate is not practical and hence all the tanks are filled with different pipes and all the pipes are fitted with individual water valves. these water valves are set as per the required water flow rate for different water ballast tank as per the time taken for the water to reach and fill the respective water ballast tank. this valve setting operation can be enhanced better if automatic process control valves are implemented for the same. process controlled valves are valves which partially open and close as per the flow of water required according to the amount of water filled in respective ballast tank. a process-controlled valve is used with the help of a plc system which is used to command the valve to control the flow of the water in ballast tank as per the required flow rate.,"pcv, valves","And Future Research In this study, we analyzed the usage of manual valves and automatic control valves in floating dry dock. We compared both the above-mentioned valves on the basis of: 1) Numerical Efficiency: Looking at the numerical formula for calculating the efficiency of valve, there is a scope of human error which may lead to higher pressure drop which decreases the efficiency of manual valves. Whereas, automatic valves have no such scope of error. 2) Leakage: Cv value i.e., Valve coefficient depends very much on the amount of water passed through the valve per minute. Any leakage in the valve would hence affect the Cv value which eventually decreases the overall efficiency of the valve. Manual Valves have greater chances of leakage than automatic valves as there are greater chances of error in closing of valve. 3) Durability: There are equal chances of corrosion in both the valves. Though, the chances of deterioration due to wear and tear decreases in the case of automatic valves. 4) Ease of Operation: Automatic valves are easier to use and are more user friendly whereas manuals are not easy to use as there is a requirement of human presence in confined spaces. Hence, we can conclude the analysis by coming to the point that using automatic control valves would be more effective in floating dry docks. There is a great scope of future research in the field of process control valve in marine field. Following points may be considered for further research in the mentioned field: 1) Maintenance: Since maintenance is one of the major tasks in marine vessels, research should be conducted further to ease the maintenance part. Suggestion: Since floating dry docks have more than fifty valves, a system should be made where it indicates the valve number and position in case of any breakdown or issue to save time and energy of locating the valve with issue. 2) Artificial Intelligence: Artificial Intelligence is being adapted widely and to keep the marine technology in line with the advanced technology. Suggestion: Since there is a requirement of a person in the control room, merging the system with Artificial Intelligence to monitor and control the actuators in positioners in order to open or close the valve could save a lot of money and increase productivity.","department of mechanical engineering, school of technology, pandit deendayal energy university, gandhinagar, gujarat dr. m b kiran associate professor department of mechanical engineering, school of technology, pandit deendayal energy university gandhinagar, gujarat",

Product flaws could result in significant and immaterial losses for the business. There are numerous ways to address the causes of faults that result from people, equipment, materials, and techniques. In order to lessen the impact of fatigue on other employees, these flaws can be fixed by hiring fresh personnel. Regular maintenance can also lessen the likelihood of faults. The government has set requirements for the raw materials to be used, and it is advised that high-quality materials be used. Extrusion is a high-volume processing technique in which plastic material is heated until it melts, then forced through a die to take on the required shape. The barrel contains a cylindrical spinning screw that pushes plastic material made of molten metal through a die. Takeoff speed, transition temperature, and metering zone are important factors that determine the quality of the products. Based on the study and analysis of the numerous papers on the fault and the observation of the researchers' opinions in the papers, it should be necessary to reduce its causes for the best extrusion product. According to observation, these quality issues (Causes) result in improper operational parameter setting. By application of above remedies, we can remove the flaw of chatter marks on pvc pipes and get optimum product quality during the extrusion process (Rao, 2019)","department of mechanical engineering, school of technology, pandit deendayal energy university, gandhinagar, india dr. m.b kiran department of mechanical engineering, pandit deendayal energy university, gandhinagar, india",

130,Analyzing The Operational Parameters Of A Single Walled  Carbon Nanotube Field Effect Transistor (Swcnt-Fet),"gordon moore, the co-founder of intel, predicted that the number of transistors would quadruple every two years. as a result, device scaling had to happen. scientists and researchers quickly learned that silicon mosfets had a scaling issue with technology. carbon nanotube field effect transistors (cntfet) are now replacing silicon metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors (mosfet) as an alternative. however, whereas we have access to precise circuit-level equations for mosfets, all we have for carbon nanotubes are model equations. in this research, we seek to model the behavior of the swcnt-fet under varying conditions of diameter and gate insulator thickness. this would allow for more accurate performance predictions from the device, paving the way for more complicated cntfet based circuit designs. variations in mobile charges, drain currents, and gate insulator thickness are among the variables investigated. simulation results demonstrate that the size of cnt diameter has direct influence on drain current which could be potential replacement of silicon technology for digital applications.","mosfet, carbon nanotube, swcnt-fet","The carbon nanotube FET's behavior has therefore been characterized by a range of input values. The graph of the mobile charge vs the gate voltage reveals that the current carrying capacity of a nanotube decreases as its diameter decreases, whereas the current carrying capacity of a nanotube with a thinner gate insulator increases. Both the nanotube's diameter and the thickness of the gate insulator have an impact on the relationship between the drain voltage and the drain current. In the future, it may be possible to determine the device's gain by analyzing other metrics, such as quantum capacitances and transconductances. 1204","s m shakil, muhammad s. ullah department of electrical and computer engineering florida polytechnic university lakeland, florida, usa sshakil2152@floridapoly.edu, mullah@floridapoly.edu","References

132,The Development Of Neural Network Based Rainfall-Runoff  Model For Kashmir Pakistan,"flooding disaster happens almost annually in pakistan. with no real solution to this incident, loss of human lives and wealth are inevitable. heavy rainfall is an important aspect which contributes to flooding. monitoring rainfall remains an integral part of flood defense system. one of the most leading method to predict flood is by developing a forecast model of rainfall-runoff. rainfall and river flow relation are very much subjective with various affecting factors. artificial neural network (ann) is preferred to model hydro system because of its accountability of nonlinear dynamics of water flow. a case study is done on a flood-prone river basin in jhelum river, in kashmir. rainfall data of 5 hydrologic stations and river level are used as the input. the performance of the learning algorithms involved were evaluated with a coefficient of determination (r) and mean square error (mse). the network configuration of the ann which best fit each algorithm is determined. the results achieved showed the promising advantage of lm as compared to br and pso.","rainfall, affect, flood, threat","The best configurations for each learning algorithms are attained. The configurations vary from one algorithm to another with no absolute number of neurons in hidden layer or delay (model order) which is dominant for all networks. This further proved the necessity of constructing a rainfall-runoff forecast model which is exclusive for a particular basin or river.12-hour forecast for rainfall-runoff prediction model in KASHMIR is developed. The results are satisfactory with prediction models producing low errors. The rainfall data and runoff data corresponds one another as the training generates good coefficient of correlation. Comparisons are made between ANNs with LM, BR and PSO as the learning algorithm. The algorithm which best suit to model Kashmir is determined. The performances of the networks are observed and the characteristics of each training algorithm, its advantages and disadvantages are analyzed and discussed. The main objective of this paper is to investigate, develop, and compare between rainfall-runoff models for the case study in Jehlum River, in Pakistan Kashmir. It could be concluded that the objective has been successfully achieved. ANNs model have been develop with three different learning algorithm applied on the simulations. The configuration which best suited each learning algorithm are determined for it to produce optimum prediction model. The performances of the networks are acquired, analyse and finally comparison are made. The best learning algorithm with custom network configuration is obtained. This presents the conclusion drawn from the study and recommendations made for further study. These are the recommendations which can further improve future studies on rainfall-runoff prediction model. Hydrological studies are wide in scope and there are many rooms for improvement. Below are some suggestions on which particular field of work that could be explored. A statistic study on how to estimate or interpolate incomplete information on rain intensity and river basin would be essential. There are gaps within the data given for rainfall and runoff. This may occurred because of rain gauge failure, measurement error or data acquisition deficiency. As missing values are discarded from the model, a portion of the data set is lost.

The results of identifying human errors in the supply chain of kemplang crackers using the adoption of the SCOR model produce 26 types of errors, where in the plan process there are 3 types of errors, in the source process there are 4 types of errors, in make there are 16 types of errors, in deliver there are 2 error and on return there are 2 errors. 2. Based on the results of research using the SHERPA method, it is found that the highest probability of error with a critical level is found in the process of ordering raw materials, receiving raw materials, storing raw materials, washing fish, drying products, checking when drying so that they are not exposed to dirt, checking order notes and payment transactions. 3. Based on the results of research using the HEART method, the highest Human Error Probability (HEP) was obtained in the process of receiving raw materials from suppliers, storing raw materials, washing fish and checking when drying them so they are not exposed to dirt with a value of 5.03.","sari wahyuni undergraduate student at department of industrial engineering faculty of engineering university of sumatera utara medan, sumatera utara, indonesia sariwhyn.29@gmail.com mohammad azmi fadli undergraduate student at department of industrial engineering faculty of engineering university of sumatera utara medan, sumatera utara, indonesia azmiefadli@gmail.com novia maharani undergraduate student at department of industrial engineering faculty of engineering university of sumatera utara medan, sumatera utara, indonesia noviamaharani30@gmail.com putri amiroh lubis undergraduate student at department of industrial engineering faculty of engineering university of sumatera utara medan, sumatera utara, indonesia putriamirahlubis@gmail.com dini wahyuni department of industrial engineering faculty of engineering university of sumatera utara medan, sumatera utara, indonesia diniwahyuni2015@gmail.com",
134,A Review On Inspection Cost Minimization By Optimal  Number Inspectors In Apparel Manufacturing,"the apparel manufacturing organization is striving to minimize manufacturing costs, including inspection costs. the main goal of this paper is to reduce inspection costs by utilizing a minimum number of inspectors. in this paper, a mathematical model has been developed which will emphasize the determination of the inspection cost. the inspection cost is related to the standard minute value and the cost per minute. furthermore, this study has been focused on the resolution of the capacity and skill level of the inspectors. moreover, a linear program has been developed which can provide the number of inspectors required based on cost and the number of pieces needed to be inspected. the data has been collected from three types of factories: large, medium-sized and low-scale manufacturing units. it has been seen that at least 30%–35% of inspectors are higher than standard. the reason behind that is a lack of awareness and knowledge by the quality manager regarding inspection capacity, skill, and inspection target for the inspector. large scale companies take an additional 25% of inspectors to stay relaxed. medium-sized factories used 30% more inspectors to cover the inspection.","inspection cost, mathematical model, linear programming, cost minimization, inspection target",,"shibbir ahmad mechanical engineering department dhaka university of engineering & technology, gazipur, bangladesh ahmadjerin@gmail.com",

In this study a mono tube MR damper model is developed which has power generation competence. Here solid works EMS based finite element analysis is accomplished for characterizing and validating the model’s accuracy of power generation. In this damper model permanent magnets and coils are used as power generators that utilize wasted vibration energy from the environment. In this energy generated damper’s EMS analysis MR fluid gap width, outside air gap width, gap length, permanent magnet length, permanent magnet thickness, non-magnetic material thickness, piston head, coil housing thickness, diameter of the piston head, the number of coil turns, different materials used in overall model are selected as design parameters for model’s accuracy. From EMS electromagnetic analysis magnetic flux density, magnetic field intensity, temperature, the applied current density has been examined to characterize the power generation feature and all the results are clearly validating that quality. The magnetic isolation between the two separated fields has been observed clearly from those results.

136,Enhancing Disaster Management Through Effective  Warehouse Location Selection Using Linguistic Decision,"effective warehouse location selection is a critical component of disaster management, as it can significantly impact the efficiency and effectiveness of disaster response efforts. this paper proposes an integrated approach based on linguistic decision making (ldm) for assessing and prioritizing key criteria for warehouse location selection in disaster management. specifically, the 2-tuple linguistic (2-tl) model is used to represent decision-maker's subjective opinions, and then an integrated methodology combining 2-tl-dematel and 2-tl-topsis (technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution) is employed for the analysis of the criteria and the selection of the optimal warehouse location. this approach allows decision-makers to effectively deal with subjective linguistic information and to handle uncertainty and imprecision in the decision-making process. the proposed methodology combines dematel for causal relation analysis and topsis for multi-criteria decision-making to identify and select the optimal warehouse location. moreover, the paper provides a case study conducted in the türkiye area to demonstrate the practical application of the proposed methodology. the results of the study provide an importance ranking of the key location selection criteria and reveal the causal relationships between them. the paper concludes that the proposed methodology can provide a structured and systematic approach for warehouse location selection in disaster management, and it can help decision-makers to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of disaster response efforts.",,,"making: an integrated approach gülçin büyüközkan professor, department of industrial engineering galatasaray university ortaköy, istanbul, turkey gbuyukozkan@gsu.edu.tr deniz uztürk department of management galatasaray university ortaköy, istanbul, turkey duzturk@gsu.edu.tr",
137,"Exam Scheduling Conflict Optimization  Ali Almaslami, Mohammad Alsaad And Abdullah Alqarne","this study presents a heuristic approach to resolve an actual scheduling problem, for an exam at the king fahd university of petroleum and minerals in saudi arabia. to assess the timeliness, we use a new objective function. in order to prevent students from taking successive tests on the same day, the goal function prioritizes timeslots above days when assigning exams to timeslots. additionally, the goal is to space out tests over the course of the testing session. this heuristic may be applied to other real-world challenges. results of computation are presented. all institutes of higher education deal with the scheduling of final exams on a regular, and difficult basis. the ability to create the timetable as early in the semester as feasible while maintaining the maximum flexibility is ideal for all parties concerned. students like to be able to plan their trip towards the end of the semester ahead of time to benefit from deals on tickets, etc. (in this essay, the term ”semester” shall be used to refer to the academic year. while the systems employed by different institutions—such as quarter, summer, trimester, etc.—vary, all are conceptually tied to the idea of a semester.) additionally, faculty like to plan as early as feasible for both the test period and any intersession breaks between periods of teaching. finally, administrators like to complete the procedure as quickly as feasible. the best time to make the final exam schedule available is during registration but doing so necessitates knowing which courses will have final exams at that time. even if it could be conceivable at some universities. the choice to provide a final exam in any specific course is based on a variety of variables. the first is that instructors are not compelled to provide final examinations, and some courses are presented in a way that does not need them. instead of a final test, some courses substitute a term paper, project, or seminar format for the class. it is up to the departments and teachers to manage this. finally, not all classes that were initially planned to meet during pre- registration period do so in any given semester, and not all teachers are known until the semester has started. this is particularly true for the fall semester because pre-registration happens in the late spring when fall hiring choices are still being made. in this paper, we discuss how we approached and overcame the scheduling issue for semester (221), year 2022, at king fahd university of petroleum and minerals (kfupm). the datasets, which comprise 598 courses, 10242 students, 30 periods, and 10 exam days, have been preprocessed based on the given data. the package comprises of a collection of heuristic techniques created to address the different stages of the issue. the pre-intervention scenario is presented first, followed by the system’s aims, the solution method, and the reasons behind the solutions selected to address the issue. the programming strategy and report generation are described in the end. in the past schedules, the registrar service at kfupm focuses on making a schedule that has no conflict and that no student has three exams in the same day, with out considering an objective, the registrar only focuses on satisfying the con- strains. this method will be fine regarding having no conflicts for any student, but it doesn’t take into account creating a schedule to enhance students performance and increasing the distance between exams. the problem we are trying to solve is not only establishing a schedule without conflicts for any student, but also we are looking to create a better schedule for the students that has suitable distribution for the courses to enhance students performance in their exams and making it easier to study. this will be done by making a well-established formulation in terms of objective function and function. in the objective function, we will aim to minimize conditions where the student have three or four exams in two consecutive days, and where the student have two exams in a raw, and where the student have two exams in three consecutive slots. to explain the slots, the aim is to establish the schedule in ten days and each day has three slots morning, afternoon, evening. as a result, we will have thirty slots in total. using the steps provided before we divide the students into groups, solve the sub problems taking into consideration the common courses between them, and combine the solutions for all groups to come up with the final exam schedule for all courses. the main difference between the solution we got and the original final exams schedule is the number 1265",,,"industrial engineering department kfupm, ksa s201847020@kfupm.edu.sa, s201845540@kfupm.edu.sa, s201816960@kfupm.edu.sa",

As in today’s competitive environment service marketers put great effort on developing customer satisfaction to maintain competitive edge research can be undertaken for outlining of what needs to be done to improve the service of the Solar Home Systems in Bangladesh. For that purpose, the researcher tried to judge its customer satisfaction with this research. The findings suggest that the service provided by Solar Home Systems has far-reaching effects on the economic, social, and demographic conditions of rural Bangladeshi society. It has significant and sustained impact on household and commercial activities. And by watching TV people are now keeping informed about the latest state of sports, culture, and political developments. Most of the respondents are found just satisfied with the Solar Home System in Bangladesh. They are found dissatisfied with some service quality variables like convenient use of the system, longevity of the SHS, sustainability of the SHS, availability of loan from the system providers, maintenance cost of the system, warranty support of the SHS, credibility of the providers, friendly behavior of the personnel, the leaflet, catalogue etc. provided with the system and availability of the parts of the system in the local market. So, the service providers should take proper care of these variables to improve the overall service quality of SHS service in Bangladesh. The service providers should offer a good quality system at a reasonable price with adequate capacity and longevity to meet up the requirements of the customers. Moreover, they should maintain a better after sale service at reasonable cost for the customers for convenient use of the systems and arrange training on technical and better service delivery to their personnel. After accounting for the study's limitations, its conclusions may be extrapolated. This research focuses on people who have installed solar panels in their homes in the Rajshahi Division. To our knowledge, this is the first research to focus on the customer's point of view. Improvements to the quality of the Solar Home System service in our nation are possible if further studies verify, reinforce, and corroborate the results of this investigation while also providing different strategic direction.","atanu debnath department of electrical engineering lamar university beaumont, texas, usa adebnath@lamar.edu na nithe, a arefin and mn uddin department of electrical and electronic engineering northern university bangladesh, banani, dhaka-1213, bangladesh engnasirbd@gmail.com, arefin.mist@gmail.com, mnuddin@nub.ac.bd emir neziric department of mechanical engineering dzemal bijedic university mostar, bosnia and herzegovina emir.neziric@unmo.ba",
139,A Framework For Reverse Engineering Process For An  Electronic Manufacturing Company: A Case Study,"since reverse engineering (re) leads to a tremendous impact on product quality, customer satisfaction, and the level of customer loyalty and retention, increased attention is given to the supply chain process. in this paper, a framework for re is built for an electronics manufacturing company using pert (project evaluation and review technique) while considering financial and political limitations. prior to this effort, re efforts at the organization were being conducted on a case-by-case basis. by implementing this framework, the organization can better plan, optimize, and document re activities. the status and features of this new re framework will be presented and future improvement recommendations will be given.",reverse logistics,"and Future Work The study was conducted on a real case in a semiconductor manufacturer in the United States of America. Historically, return merchandised process was not implemented consistently and there was no standardized documentation for it. The research team worked on documenting the process and building a consolidated flow chart for it. This comes as a result of multiple meetings with various teams. The customer service, warehouse, production, and upper management were all included in the meetings. PERT was applied over the build process flow chart and the expected time for RMA is 73.53 hours. The critical activities were found to be A, B, D, E, F, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, and V. Although the average activity durations used in PERT calculations provide for an overall mean time for project completion (in this case a mean completion time of 73.53 for this RMA process), it would also be useful as an ongoing effort to determine, for example, a 95% confidence interval on that path by incorporating the different activities’ variations. The critical path for the RMA process was clarified. Later, studies can be done on the critical activities to find the possible crash time for each step and its cost. So, if a crash output overweighs its cost, that activity will be crashed. By this, the expected RMA time can be decreased. After being implementing the proposed RMA successfully for five observations, the company, which the research was conducted in, shown huge interest in our research and ask for our corporation to implement it for a long term. 1283","basel sultan and daryl santos thomas j. watson college of engineering and applied science the state university of new york at binghamton binghamton, ny 13902, usa bsultan2@binghamton.edu, santos@binghamton.edu michael hsieh foxconn industrial internet houston, tx 77064, usa michael.hsieh@fii-na.com","References

140,Hyper-Segmentation Lapser Mytelkomsel Apps Using Kmeans Clustering To Increase Data Package Purchases In,"telkomsel is currently working to enhance the basis of the digital business by pursuing digital transformation. given the intense competitiveness in the digital telecommunications industry, this is a crucial task. mytelkomsel apps, a self-service digital channel, was introduced by telkomsel on march 25, 2016, as evidence of the company's digital transformation. mytelkomsel apps streamlines the purchasing of credit, data packages, kartuhalo bill payments, and exchange point self-service for telkomsel customers. however, there is still a low conversion rate in the mytelkomsel apps between active users (users of the app) and package users (purchasers of the product). there are active customers who previously actively purchased products but do not currently do so on mytelkomsel apps, or what is known as mytelkomsel lapser, which is one of the causes of the poor conversion rate. therefore, the issue at hand today is how to reactivate mytelkomsel lapser so they can renew their product to mytelkomsel apps. in order for telkomsel to offer tailored treatment to recover lapsed transactions in mytelkomsel apps, the goal of this research is to give telkomsel knowledge into the precise profile of mytelkomsel apps lapsers. 2.206.636 clients are lapsers as of march 2023. the decision tree algorithm is used to predict lapsers who are in the high prospect group to become non lapsers and the k-means cluster algorithm is used to create lapser segments from 2.206.636 lapsers based on relevant variables that have been determined, and in one data set with a period of march 2023. there are 70 variables made up of 1 geographic variable, 8 psychographic variables, and 61 behavioral variables. 1.914.232 lapsers are collected from the data cleansing procedure, which may then be processed to separate them into 20% testing data and 80% training data. with a model accuracy of 97.25%, it is predicted that 45,116 (2.35%) consumers will make purchases at mytelkomsel and 1.869.116 (97.64%) customers will stay lapser after the variables are discovered and the lapser data is processed using the decision tree method. the top 5 significant variables from the model are the number of data package purchases made through the mkios channel, the umb channel, acquisition-type purchases, physical voucher purchases, and transaction-type purchases of data packages. furthermore, using the k-means cluster technique, 45.116 consumers are divided into clusters based on the top 5 important variables. the silhouette index for these 45.116 high-prospect clients is divided into 3 clusters, with n_cluster = 3 having the biggest value (0.78), compared to the other n_cluster. low data user (94.89%), medium data through umb channel (4.14%), and physical voucher user with medium arpu (0.97%) are the 3 clusters that were formed. telkomsel can perform behavioral targeting for the three clusters based on the prediction model & clustering results to give tailored product gimmicks.",market segmentation,"Decision Tree addresses the issue of predicting a target variable that may be binary or binomial (such as 1 or 0, yes or no) using predictors or attributes, which may be numeric. By applying it to all populations of lapser MyTelkomsel Apps by 2.206.636 customers. There were identified 45.116 customers as highly likelihood to purchase package in MyTelkomsel Apps and 4.14% of them came from Medium Data Users through UMB Channel segment with average data revenue per user reached IDR 150.000. Top 5 significant variables that affected customers to purchase package in MyTelokmsel Apps are data recharge amount thru UMB and MKIOS Channel, recharge of acquisition pack type and physical voucher type and number of broadband package transaction.

145,End To End Quality Control In Consumer Electronics   Rohan Viswanath,"end-to-end quality control is the process of ensuring that a product meets all quality standards throughout its entire lifecycle, from design and manufacturing to delivery and customer use. it is important for every industry that manufactures tangible products used by customers on a day-to-day basis. for consumer electronics it is equally important because it helps to ensure that products are safe, reliable, and meet customer expectations for daily use of tangible products. end-to-end quality control can help to identify and fix defects early in the product development process, which can save time and money. it can also help to prevent customer returns and improve customer satisfaction.it includes both incoming inspection of materials and components, and in-process and final inspection of finished products. incoming quality control incoming inspection (often referred to as incoming quality control or iqc) ensures that all materials and components meet the required specifications. this is done by sampling and testing materials and components to verify that they meet the required properties. there are various methods to pick samples for testing including: ● statistical sampling ● random sampling ● first-off sampling ● batch sampling ● acceptance sampling upstream out-going quality control iqc down-stream is as important as performing outgoing inspection (often referred to as outgoing quality control or oqc) at a previous node. oqc checks typically happen at a larger sampling rate compared to the downstream incoming checks. typical oqc checks include nondestructive inspections like dimensional, cosmetic and functional checks based on drawing specifications, and destructive inspections and reliability. performing 100% inspection at both iqc and oqc is not feasible in most cases. sampling is widely used in businesses owing to benefits obtained when facing detrimental aspects of 100% inspection like: ● destructive inspection where a quantity of product is destroyed during testing and a business wants to limit this ● costs associated with 100% inspection are not economica in process quality control in-process inspection (often referred to as in process quality control or ipqc) ensures that products are being manufactured correctly throughout the production process. this is done by inspecting products at various sub- assembly stages of production. this ensures that an issue with the manufacturing process is caught earlier in the cycle to help save costs with finding defects further down in the supply chain. final inspection ensures that finished products meet all quality standards before they are shipped to customers. this is done by inspecting products for defects and verifying that they meet all specifications. this includes cosmetic, functional, dimensional checks as well as reliability checks there are a number of different methods that can be used for end-to-end quality control, including: ● design reviews ● process audits ● product testing and reliability testing ● customer feedback statistics statistical control is really important when it comes to analyzing data from each of these inspection nodes. there are multiple data visualization methods to visualize, analyze and act on data obtained from inspections including (but not all inclusive) - box plots, histograms, pareto, scatter plot, correlation and regression analysis plots. 1300",,,google inc. rohanv@umich.edu,
146,Barriers To Agile Project Management Implementation:  Findings From A Systematic Literature Review,"this study aims to discuss the barriers of agile project management, considering the increase of utilization of agile methods worldwide specially because it has helped companies get better productivity and reduce their wastes. and, because agility (adaptability to need) has become an advantage for companies into a highly competitive business world. according to erhun et al. (2021) agility describes a company’s ability to respond to short-term changes in market demand or supply quickly and handle external disruptions smoothly. the analysis of the literature has been conducted using the web of science and scopus databases as well as the vos viewer software for a deeper analysis of 26 articles selected. it is important to remember the agile manifesto was born and developed oriented to the world of software, seeking to generate tangible value to the customer at the expense of the vast documentation less experimental and due its good results, these methods have also been integrated into other sectors. on the other hand, agile methods often face some barriers to its implementation particularly from someone who has been taught on traditional ways of project management. considering so the advantages of agile and the existence of barriers to implementing, this paper intend to list the main barriers to the agile trough a systematic literature review.","agile, barriers, project, productivity","The systematic literature review returned 26 articles selected for further analysis and these ones exposed the barriers to adequate implementation of agile methods. Although Agile Project Management has been increasingly adopted to get better results for the companies it often faces barriers to its implementation and development particularly for people who do not know exactly how it works. The lack of top management support and commitment is one of the top barriers that Agile implementation faces sometimes because the Top management are stuck in the old ways of management. Having no support from highly hierarchical levels of the company it becomes even tough to get the investments on competencies to use and perform Agile properly. Finally, it is important to investigate ways to overcome those main barriers cited in this article, which in turn it is a suggestion for future research into the field. 5.1 Practical implications The practical implications are that the main barriers exposed in this article can help other researchers have a compilation view about “what are the main barriers to Agile Project Management”. Additionally, Agile Teams can serve themselves of this study preventing them about which barriers they will face during the Agile implementation. 5.2 Theoretical implications The implications to the theoretical aspect are important knowing no systematic literature review has been found through the research done into the databases selected. Besides that, regarding the theoretical implications, this article brings a novel contribution, showing the main barriers to Agile Project Management implementation for Management area.","edson oliveira martins master student in the department of school of management federal university of paraná, ufpr school of management, pr, curitiba, brazil edson.martins@ufpr.br guilherme francisco frederico professor in the department of school of management federal university of paraná, ufpr school of management, pr, curitiba, brazil guilherme.frederico@ufpr.br",

150,Workflow Improvements And Workplace Redesign For An  Office Space,"the purpose of this study is to determine whether using screencasts and snapshots in an instructional workflow for new learners will lower the time required for them to create a data report. our team examined the current workflow that a regional organization uses to teach new employees and redesigned it to include screencasts and snapshots, which allow the user to see what exactly needs to be done on a screen just like theirs. after the team created a version of the workflow, they assembled a control group and an experimental group, each of seven people. the control group used the original workflow to complete a data report, while the experimental group used the new workflow. for each individual workflow was timed and found the mean time of each group. on average, the experimental group was able to complete their data report about 2.66 minutes (8.5%) earlier than the control group, and the difference in times was statistically significant. the study team was also offered the opportunity to design a new office layout for that office space. the goal was to provide the organization with a design that allowed for synchronous work. the team researched various types of facility layouts and decided to base the design on a process layout. ergonomics and other various standards were considered while redesigning the office layout. through the proposed design, the study team was able to create a more collaborative space, which would allow employees to communicate more easily and efficiently.","2-sample t-test, office layout, screencasts","Based on the results of the workflow study, it can be concluded that using Screenpresso for creating workflow will significantly shorten (8.5%) the time required to complete a data report for new learners. Thus, if this time saving is scaled on a yearly basis for the whole company the trend of time savings will translate to hundreds of thousands of dollars. The idea of an improved visual walkthrough enhances both the quality of the client reports as well as productivity within the company. Using Screenpresso to create visual walkthroughs for the workflow document shows the employee exactly how the image should look and where the data should be placed. This creates and displays a standardized example of how each snapshot should look, leaving nothing to interpretation. Doing so also gives employees the ability to hand off reports to each other, when necessary, which can be crucial when one person may not be able to complete their work. Another employee could simply pick up where they left off, and the client would never notice the difference because of the standardized look of each snapshot. On the other hand, the redesign of the current office layout into a process layout gives the company the ability to have their employees work congruently on 1330","alexander makarewich and mason pitts industrial engineering technology graduates department of engineering technology northwestern state university, natchitoches, la 71497, usa md. shahriar j. hossain interim department head and assistant professor department of engineering technology northwestern state university, natchitoches, la 71497, usa hossains@nsula.edu","References

151,Reverse Logistics Strategy For Electronic Waste  Infrastructure In Indonesia,"electronic waste is a type of organic waste whose growth is very fast, about three times faster than other waste. the volume of e-waste generated worldwide in 2019 was around 54 million metric tons and is expected to continue to increase until by 2030, annual worldwide e-waste production will increase by around 30 percent or around 75 million metric tons. specific regulations in e-waste management are important factors in preventing and reducing e-waste. indonesia is an example of a country that does not yet have specific regulations for electronic waste management. currently, indonesia is the largest e-waste producing country in asia with an e-waste value of 1.3 million metric tons. this research is one of the efforts to provide recommendations for strategies to reduce the amount of electronic waste in indonesia. strategies are collected based on literature and validated by experts for the suitability of strategy implementation in indonesia. a total of 20 recommendations for the reverse logistics strategy for e-waste processing infrastructure were successfully validated and then arranged based on a structural hierarchical strategy. this study uses the help of the interpretive structural modeling (ism) method to develop a strategy in the form of a hierarchical structure. matrice d'impacts croises multiplication appliquee aun classement (micmac) analysis to determine the classification of strategies based on driving forces and dependencies between strategies. the resulting structural model is used as a strategic map for implementing a strategy to reduce the amount of e-waste in indonesia.",e-waste,"Research on reverse logistics has been increasing over the years, especially in the case of electronic waste, with many practitioners being interested in the reverse logistics concept which has many benefits for environmental balance as well as effective waste management, cost, carbon impact and health or safety. The implementation of reverse logistics for e-waste processing infrastructure in Indonesia is a long-term step that will change the entire infrastructure from the process of collection, recycling to redistribution and the main goal is to be able to reduce e-waste in Indonesia. Therefore, a strategy of various is needed to reach that goal. In this study there are 3 sections consisting of 20 validated strategies which can be seen in the Figure 1. This research requires the help of all stakeholders so that it can run well and in a structured manner. Figure 1. Validated Strategies Admittedly, this research has some limitations. There is still little research on electronic waste in Indonesia and the implementation of reverse logistics has not been widely used in various industries. This of course can make the results of this study not fully related. In fact, we have presented experts from small companies to multinational companies, non-governmental organizations and academics. Subsequently. These limitations represent viable avenues for future research on this topic. Future work might try to expand the expertise. Also, this study suggests using ISM and MICMAC to be able to prove the relationship between existing elements. This method can be developed to formulate policy strategies, especially for waste management. This will determine the level of hierarchy between strategies based on analysis using the level of driving power and dependency power of each variable. 1339","sangdaffa adetyantama industrial engineering universitas indonesia depok, indonesia sangdaffa.adetyantama11@ui.ac.id romadhani ardi industrial engineering universitas indonesia depok, indonesia romadhani.ardi@ui.ac.id","References

152,Selection Of Solar Panels Based On Brand Using Fuzzy Ahp  – Topsis Method,"the development of renewable energy has provided indonesia with an opportunity to tap into its solar energy potential, which amounts to a staggering 207 gw. this opportunity is further driven by the increasing demand for electricity, the aging and inefficient fossil fuel power plants, the declining costs of solar panel installations, and the ease of their deployment. however, customers often encounter challenges in selecting the appropriate solar panels. these challenges stem from various factors, including the lack of easily accessible product information, the multitude of alternatives with diverse parameters in solar panel selection, and the absence of brand-specific recommendations for implementing solar panel types. consequently, customers face difficulties in making informed decisions, potentially hindering the acceleration and optimization of solar panel expansion plans while also increasing the risk of investment errors. solar panels come in various types based on their brands, and each brand possesses distinct advantages and disadvantages, making it difficult to determine the most optimal choice for implementation. therefore, a selection process is necessary to identify the most suitable solar panel type based on brand, utilizing the multi-criteria decision making (mcdm) method known as fuzzy ahp-topsis. this method will evaluate nine alternative monocrystalline solar panel types, each with a power rating of 540 watts peak, sourced from different brands. the evaluation will be based on validated criteria established through expert assessments. by implementing this method, customers will be empowered with a systematic approach and better recommendations for selecting solar panel products.","photovoltaic, solar panel, fuzzy ahp – topsis","In selecting the type of solar panel based on the brand, which is carried out using Fuzzy AHP-TOPSIS, the subjectivity obtained from the decision maker is reduced, ensuring ambiguity and various inaccuracies when evaluating are eliminated. This method succeeded in providing the most optimal solar panel product recommendations by considering the main criteria that are often used when selecting solar panels, namely electrical, mechanical, economic, environmental, and customer satisfaction criteria. Based on the data processing carried out on the assessment of experts, it appears that the electrical criteria have the most weight, followed sequentially by economic, customer satisfaction, mechanical, and environmental criteria. However, when viewed from the global weight value of each sub-criteria, the 5 sub-criteria that have the highest weight sequentially are the sub-criteria cost per watt, price, reliability, dimension, and weight. Based on the weight values obtained, we can get the most optimal solar panel product overall, which is alternative A. Meanwhile, the least recommended solar panel product overall is alternative H.","ignatius malvin francia industrial engineering universitas indonesia salemba, indonesia ignatius.malvin11@ui.ac.id dr. ir. andri dwi setiawan, m.sc industrial engineering universitas indonesia salemba, indonesia a.d.setiawan@ui.ac.id",

154,"Motion And Time Study For Increasing Efficiency,  Productivity, And Safety For An Unloading Facility","this project analyzed a proposed installation of a loading dock to increase the efficiency of the unloading facility of a building materials distributor while ensuring the employees’ safety. the facility deals with the unloading and organization of doors from the suppliers. this two-man operation begins with unloading the doors onto a rack that is lifted in the air by a forklift operator. after unloading the doors, they are carried into a shed, and the rack is placed where there is free space. if there is none, the doors are unloaded from the rack and placed in a row against the wall. the installation of a loading dock is proposed on the east wall of the shed. with the installation of the loading dock, the supplier will be allowed to back into the loading dock at ground level and provide a safer and more efficient method of unloading doors while keeping them organized afterward. to justify the construction of the loading dock, a time study was conducted over 10 weeks to determine the average standard time it takes to unload one door. simio software was then used to create what-if scenarios that showed the loading dock would cut unloading time almost in half. by comparing the observed times to simulated times and researching injury costs, the payback period, internal rate of return, benefit-cost ratio, and net present value of the loading dock were determined to justify the construction from an economical perspective.","time study, simio simulation, payback period, benefit-cost ratio","For this project, the team analyzed the system for unloading doors from the supplier. It is clear from touring the yard that the unloading system is a hazard to the safety and has proven to be inefficient in production and organization. The team conducted a time study for 10 weeks that analyzed the unloading times, and the number of doors received each week. The number of doors and time each week varied, but the team broke down the data even further to the average time it takes to unload one door. This data concluded that the unloading system was very inefficient and can be improved. The group proposed the installation of a loading dock to increase the efficiency in terms of productive time of the unloading facility while ensuring employees’ safety. A simulation model was created that predicted the loading dock would indeed be more efficient. Lastly, the Payback Period, Benefit-Cost Ratio, Net Present Value, and Internal Rate of Return for the loading dock were estimated which justifies the economic aspect of the investment for a new loading dock. The improvement of safety that the loading dock would bring plus the simulation predicting its increased efficiency justifies its construction. A loading dock would have a tremendous impact on the facility. Safety would be the first benefit of installing a loading dock. In the current procedure for unloading the doors, safety is a big issue when it comes to this weekly task. Installing a loading dock would increase the safety of the employees. Instead of unloading the doors into a rack, the employee would now be able to come straight off the truck into the shed. This would keep the employee from wearing a harness and the doors being unloaded from the truck in a much safer manner. Another benefit of installing a loading dock would be more time to organize. Currently, as the doors are unloaded from the truck and into the rack, the rack is either placed in a random location in the shed or the doors are unloaded onto a previous stack of doors. Many of the doors are either spread out from their order or buried from the doors that are being received. Installing a loading dock would allow the employees to find a designated spot for the incoming doors and additional space for the racks to be placed in an organized manner. This would save stagers a great amount of time looking for the doors when gathering a delivery. Organizing the doors would allow stagers to find and gather the doors into a rack in a timely manner to be sent on delivery. The third benefit of installing a loading dock would be allowing another stager to use a forklift. As of now, one forklift is used to unload the doors. This causes one stager to give up his use of a forklift. This results in a delay in gathering loads. It is a stager’s job at the facility to gather the materials for deliveries for the next day. Without a forklift, a stager cannot gather materials which could result in a delay in deliveries. Installing this dock would allow the stagers to continue gathering materials, while also allowing one employee to unload the doors.","matthew lovelady, nickolas tramel, and tanner funderburk industrial engineering technology graduates department of engineering technology northwestern state university, natchitoches, la 71497, usa md. shahriar j. hossain interim department head and assistant professor department of engineering technology northwestern state university, natchitoches, la 71497, usa hossains@nsula.edu nabin sapkota associate professor department of engineering technology northwestern state university, natchitoches, la 71497, usa sapkotan@nsula.edu",

157,"Dynamic Design Of Water Flow Management In Lebak  Swamp Land, Pesisir Selatan District, West Sumatra","pesisir selatan district is located on the coast, with a coastline of 218 kilometers. the topography consists of plains, mountains and hills. the expansion of agricultural areas in pesisir selatan district has an important meaning given the limited land for agricultural cultivation in the area. the water level will fluctuate due to the influence of the season and rainfall, where during the rainy season the soil is flooded and during the dry season it will recede, so that plant commodities to be developed must pay attention to their adaptability to groundwater depth. this research aims to support government programs in reclamation of agricultural land in an effort to maximize the function of lebak swamplands. primary data includes groundwater and water in canals, temperature, soil physical properties, and rainfall. the analysis used is an analysis of the relationship between rainfall, temperature, soil physical properties, and the water level in the canal to fluctuations in the groundwater level. the results of the analysis show that temperature, rainfall, soil conductivity, and the rise and fall of the water level in the canal have an effect on the rise and fall of the groundwater level. dynamic model in water management can be used as a guideline for the use of lebak swamp land during the covid-19 pandemic. the potential for utilizing lebak swamp land as an alternative for future land through the concept of optimizing land resources is carried out with an integrated farming system that is environmentally friendly.","design, waterflow, lebak, swampland","The expansion of agricultural areas in Pesisir Selatan District has an important meaning given the limited land for agricultural cultivation in the area. The alternative to lebak swamp land is a solution for future agricultural land in Pesisir Selatan District. The temperature at the study site ranges from 260C – 350C, with a maximum rainfall of 258 mm/day. The soil in the research location is a type of clay which means it is very good for agricultural land. Rainfall and temperature affect fluctuations in the groundwater table. Groundwater level fluctuations are affected by hydraulic conductivity and water level fluctuations in canals. The relationship between the rise in the water level in the canals and the rise in the groundwater level is linear, where if the water level in the canals rises, the groundwater level will also rise and vice versa. The modeling simulation results show that the model can predict well the depth of the groundwater table at the study site with an average value of the coefficient of determination of 87.8%, and groundwater level control can be done by adjusting the water level in the tertiary channel. The approach taken in the development of lebak swamp land refers to land typologies, where each land typology requires different management methods. Dynamic water flow management is the key to the successful use of lebak swamp land for agriculture during the Covid-19 period. The potential and opportunities for utilizing lebak swamp land need to be developed as an alternative for future agricultural land. Optimization of lebak swamp land resources is carried out with an innovative, integrated, agribusiness and sustainable system through the concept of an environmentally friendly integrated farming system.","during the covid-19 period yenita and agustinus purna irawan faculty of engineering universitas tarumanagara letjen s. parman no. 1, west jakarta, indonesia yenita@fe.untar.ac.id",

159,Impact Of Heat-Treatment On Wear Behaviour  Of Stainless Steel Printed Using Laser Powder Fusion Bed,"for the creation of intricate metal parts, additive manufacturing, notably laser powder fusion bed (lpfb) technology processed 17%cr-4%ni precipitation hardened (p.h) steel. the samples were printed in three directions (horizontal (0o), vertical (90o) and inclined (45o) in the build platform using dmls system (eos m 290) machine. 17%cr- 4%nip.h steel samples were given heat treatment for 900°c @ 1 hour, 925°c @ 4 hours, 1025°c @ 1 hour, has attracted a lot of interest recently. many industries employ stainless steel because of its high mechanical and corrosion resistant qualities. however, there is currently a lack of knowledge on the wear behaviour of stainless steel produced employing lpfb, especially following heat-treatment procedures. the purpose of this study is to ascertain how heat treatment affects the lpfb-printed stainless steels wear characteristics. commercial lpfb equipment was used to produce the stainless-steel specimens, which were then put through several heat-treatment processes. the ideal qualities of the printed stainless steel were ensured by carefully choosing the heat-treatment parameters, including temperature and time. using a pin-on-disk tribometer, the wear behaviour of the heat-treated stainless-steel specimens was assessed. under varied orientation of specimens(pin) situations, the tribological parameters, including coefficient of friction and wear rate, were measured. the wear processes and surface texture of the worn surfaces were further studied using scanning electron microscopy (sem). according to preliminary findings, heat treatment has a substantial impact on the wear behaviour of stainless steel printed using lpfb. it was found that 1025°c @ 1 hour settings enhanced the printed stainless steels wear resistance, resulting in a lower friction coefficient and wear rate. according to sem examination, heat-treated specimens had a more refined microstructure and better surface integrity, which helped to improve wear performance. this study sheds important light on how heat treatment affects the lpfb-printed stainless steel's wear characteristics. the findings help to improve the post-processing methods used in the additive manufacture of stainless-steel components in order to increase their resistance to wear and lengthen their useful lives in demanding applications. the sectors involved in additive manufacturing and other fields can benefit from the information gleaned from this study.","surface roughness, stainless steel, orientation, wear",,"pooja angolkar research scholar, department of mechanical engineering, jntu hyderabad, india 21pooj@gmail.com m. manzoor hussain professor in mechanical engineering and registrar jawaharlal nehru technological university hyderabad india manzoorjntu@jntuh.ac.in phani raja kumar katuru sr. manager, tech mahindra americas, usa dr.phanikaturu@gmail.com","References

A number of challenges were identiﬁed which affect the implementation of 4IR within higher education institutions such as staff members & students not technologically savvy, 4IR infrastructure not amended, students are overcrowded in classrooms, Lack of communication between stakeholders within the university, lack of proportion in teaching & technology, High costs of information & communication technology services, Limited university resources etc. The 4IR offers, among others, a greater opportunity for participation in the digital economy and collaborative partnership.","thalente lungile nkosi department of construction management and quantity surveying university of johannesburg johannesburg, rsa thalentelungile4@gmail.com morena william nkomo and stephan molusiwa ramabodu department of construction management and quantity surveying university of johannesburg johannesburg, rsa mnkomo@uj.ac.za, molusiwar@uj.ac.za",
164,Assessing Spatial Planning Readiness To Accommodate  Innovative Transport Systems And Technologies.,"contemporary cities have taken up efforts to decarbonize urban mobility which has led to a growth in electric vehicles and investment in new renewable energy opportunities. the current transport sector contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, air pollution, and traffic congestion. this has led to a growth in studies to develop a reservoir of knowledge on sustainable mobility to address this challenge. the global shift towards electric vehicles has provided greater energy efficiency as part of the global climate change mitigation strategies, however, electric vehicles are not widely adopted in developing countries due to factors such as insufficient charging stations. globally this shift to electric vehicles and the spatial distribution of charging stations has been informed by the private sector. this has led to city authorities to be reactive to the implementation of electric vehicle and its charging infrastructure. there is hence a need to assess the readiness of spatial planning to facilitate the transition towards electric vehicles and its infrastructure. given this emerging trend in urban mobility transition, there have been lack of proactive policy initiatives to inform the adoption of electric vehicles. using a qualitative research approach this study unpacks the adoption of electric vehicles from urban spatial planning perspective. fifteen participants from the city of tshwane were interviewed using a semi-structured interview format. the participants were selected using snowball sampling and purposive sampling. content analysis was used to develop themes. findings of the study reveal areas where the charging infrastructure is placed, as these can be found in public spaces such as shopping malls and office parks in the city of tshwane. the implications of the study are creation of a reservoir on knowledge to inform plans for developing countries such as south africa to integrate spatial distribution of charging stations with sustainable mobility initiatives. future studies should develop a framework to inform the broader aspects of spatial planning in relation to innovative sustainable transport systems.","electric vehicle, spatial planning",,"desmond nkopodi mphahlele and trynos gumbo university of johannesburg, department of urban and regional planning, office 6062, sixth floor, john orr building, beit and siemert street, 2028. johannesburg, south africa mphahlelend@gmail.com, tgumbo@uj.ac.za thembani moyo centre for applied research + innovation in the built environment (carinbe) university of johannesburg, department of construction management & quantity surveying, office 6166, sixth floor, john orr building, beit and siemert street, 2028. johannesburg, south africa tmoyo@uj.ac.za","References

165,An Initial Exploration Of Patterns Of Variation In Healthcare  Provider Reimbursement Rates From A Massive New Dataset,"health plan price transparency rules that became effective january 1, 2022 require most group health plan insurers to disclose reimbursement rates negotiated between insurers and providers. using a small subset of this massive new data source, we characterize patterns of variation in rates negotiated between a large health insurance company and healthcare providers for office visits in florida. rates vary with location, specialty, and practice size and, importantly, with complex interactions among these factors. rates are higher for larger providers, consistent with larger providers having more market power. patterns of differences in rates across plans offered by the insurer with respect to moderating factors such as per capita income differ between larger and smaller providers, consistent with larger providers using their market power to engage in various forms of price discrimination. considerable variation in rates remains after accounting for these factors in a highly parameterized model, some of which may be due to uncontrolled variation in provider quality. our exploratory findings demonstrate the potential for this massive new dataset to facilitate a deeper understanding of the workings of healthcare markets, improving the knowledge base for policies aimed at controlling costs or improving quality or access.","healthcare spending, negotiated rates, market mechanisms","We utilized a limited extract of data from a rich and massive newly available dataset on rates negotiated between insurers and medical practices to explore patterns or variation in rates across counties, specialties, practice sizes, and different plans representing different insured groups and provider networks. We find larger practice sizes are associated with higher rates, at least for the insurer examined herein. Moreover, we find that both specialty and location moderate differences in rates associated with variation in practice size across plans. We also find that even after controlling for county, specialty, practice size, and plan, tremendous variation in rates around the conditional expectation remains. There are many avenues for future work. We plan to pursue several of them in the future. First, we plan to expand the analysis to include more insurers and more states. Second, with the addition of extensive data from other insurers and other states, we should be able to conduct both analyses to confirm the patterns we found in this study and to further explore patterns of rate variations in response to other factors. Third, we plan to collect data on patient ratings of providers, provider outcomes, location specific measures of provider wages by specialty, and other such information in order to explain more of the variation in rates. Fourth, additional work is needed to differentiate between different plausible explanations of the patterns found in this exploratory analysis. For example, are rates higher for larger practices because they are able to offer higher quality due to the scope and scale of their operations, and thus face higher demand, or because they have more bargaining power? Or, similarly, do differences between the ways rates in larger and smaller practices adjust with differences in per capita incomes across counties and across plans arise from using market power to engage in price discrimination to extract more value from patients, or from differences in demand across locations due in part to income? The ability to exploit this new data source to provide rich characterizations of pricing patterns is promising. Moreover, this data may facilitate distinguishing between differing underlying causes of those patterns more rigorously, and with more generalizability, than has been possible in the past. Thus, continued analysis of this new dataset promises to greatly improve our understanding of healthcare markets and thereby our ability to design policies to control costs or improve outcomes, quality, and access. 100 150 Predicted Rate 1 2-49 50-199 200+ Practice Size Plan 1, Less Common Plan 1, More Common Plan 2, Less Common Plan 2, More Common Margins: Practice Size, Plan, and Specialty Prevalence 1436","jim dewey and susan lefrancois florida polytechnic university 4700 research way lakeland, florida 33805 jdewey@floridapoly.edu, slefrancois@floridapoly.edu","References

It provides researchers with a flexible and robust technique to explore causal relationships, even in situations with limited theoretical foundations and small sample sizes. PLS-SEM's ability to handle non-normal data distributions and missing data further enhances its applicability in analyzing archival datasets. By following best practices in model specification, data preparation, and reporting, researchers can ensure the validity and reliability of their findings. However, there are several avenues for future research in using PLS-SEM in archival research: Methodological advancements: Further methodological developments can focus on refining the PLS-SEM technique for analyzing archival data. This could include addressing specific challenges associated with handling large and complex datasets, developing techniques for handling missing data more effectively, and improving model validation procedures. 1. Integration of PLS-SEM with other statistical techniques: Exploring the integration of PLS-SEM with other statistical techniques can enhance the analysis of archival data. This may involve combining PLS- SEM with advanced multivariate techniques or integrating it with machine learning approaches to gain deeper insights from complex datasets. 2. Comparative studies: Comparative studies that compare the results obtained from PLS-SEM with other statistical techniques commonly used in archival research can provide insights into the strengths and limitations of PLS-SEM. This can help researchers determine the most appropriate analytical approach for their specific research questions and data characteristics. By addressing these future research directions, researchers can further enhance the application of PLS-SEM in archival research, broaden its scope of application, and contribute to the advancement of empirical knowledge in various disciplines.","anass bayaga nelson mandela university anass.bayaga@mandela.ac.za, south africa, https//orcid/0000-0003-0283-0262",

169,Improving Pediatric Intensive Care Unit Risk Management  Using Failure Mode And Effect Analysis,"pediatric intensive care units are prone to a variety of errors and risks. failure mode and effects analysis (fmea) is a risk assessment and management method that evaluates the safety of patient care processes. the current study aims to identify and assess common medical errors in the pediatric intensive care unit (pcicu) at a cardiac pediatric centre in egypt and identify the highest risk probability number (rpn), its root causes as well as recommended solutions. this descriptive analytic applied research was conducted from september 2022 to january 2023 in the pcicu of a cardiac pediatric centre in upper egypt to identify and assess medical errors and their effects qualitatively and quantitatively using fmea through direct observations of the pcicu processes, brainstorming and interviews. for data collection, the fmea standard worksheet was used to a purposive sample of 10 experts whose years of experience are more than 5 years. in this study, 3 key processes were selected: laboratory test, drug administration and infection control which included 13 activities. the research revealed 20 potential failure modes, their impacts were detected and recorded in the final worksheet of fmea. according to the calculated rpns, 8 potential failure modes with rpn > 65 were determined as high-risk failures. as a result, it is suggested that senior pcicu staff, doctors and senior managers establish and promote a safety culture by forming multidisciplinary patient safety teams at the organizational and unit levels.","risk assessment, egypt","In conclusion, FMEA is a valuable tool for identifying potential failures and their effects, as well as developing and implementing effective risk mitigation strategies in healthcare organizations. FMEA can be used to evaluate and improve various healthcare processes, including patient safety, medication management, and infection control. By using FMEA, healthcare organizations can proactively identify risks and implement interventions to prevent negative outcomes, thereby improving patient safety and overall healthcare quality. However, healthcare organizations should be aware of the limitations of FMEA and ensure that it is used appropriately. FMEA is not a one-time fix but should be considered as part of a continuous quality improvement process.

Overall, FMEA is a valuable tool in healthcare quality improvement and should be used as part of a comprehensive approach to patient safety and quality improvement.","hedaia abdullah, sahar elbarky, maha morssi and sara elzarka international transport & logistics institute arab academy for science, technology & maritime transport, alexandria, egypt hedaia.abdallah2016@gmail.com, selbarky@aast.edu, mahamorssi64@gmail.com, sara_elzarka@aast.edu",
170,Role Of Technology In The Performance Measure Of Insulin  Cold Chains,"insulin is seen as an essential medication in high demand in the pharmaceutical industry. optimizing the supply chain for insulin cannot be overstated to ensure patients have access to the medication they need and that the provider or supplier's costs can be managed efficiently. in order to ensure that patients have access to lifesaving medicines in a timely manner, the insulin supply chain (isc) can be improved to become more efficient and effective. a semi- structured interview method was used in this study to analyze the issue of enhancing the effectiveness of the isc and reducing the presence of counterfeit drugs by interviewing seven participants from the pharmaceutical sector in doha, qatar. as a result of this study, four themes were identified. these were: 1) limitations in transporting insulin, 2) methods for ensuring the effectiveness of the supply chain, 3) the importance of adopting advanced traceability methods to ensure that insulin is transported efficiently, and 4) rfid as a way to ensure that insulin is transported safely and appropriately throughout the supply chain. participants in the study indicated that radio frequency identification (rfid) in the cold chain for insulin increased its efficiency by increasing its effectiveness.","cold supply chain, perishable drug",,"mona haji logistics and supply chain management department college of science and engineering hamad bin khalifa university doha, qatar mhaji@hbku.edu.qa",
171,Drugs And Food Anti-Counterfeiting Technologies  Combating Counterfeiting: A Systematic Review,"anti-counterfeiting technologies have evolved over the past few years to combat and prevent counterfeiting incidents in the pharmaceutical and food sectors. it is worth noting that numerous studies have used different technologies to combat food and drug counterfeiting. the current systematic review evaluated these technologies' use, effectiveness, and how they could be used to eliminate food and drug counterfeiting. several online databases were searched and retrieved for articles related to anti-counterfeiting technology for drugs and food and published literature from (2010 to 2022). a thorough examination of the selected publications was done to extract useful information, including study design, the application of those technologies to combat counterfeiting of drugs and food, how those technologies are implemented, their effectiveness in fighting counterfeiting, evaluation outcomes, the country of study, the name of the author(s), as well as the publication year. in the study, 29 publications were selected and evaluated, with 22 (75.86%) dealing with anti-counterfeiting technologies related to drugs, 4 (13.79%) pertaining to anti-counterfeiting technologies related to food, while three (10.34%) dealt with both anti-counterfeiting technologies related to drugs and food. blockchain technologies have mainly been used in the fight against counterfeiting, with the majority in china 8 (27.58%), and the highest number of reported studies was reported in 2021 (n=6; 20.68%), followed by 2016 and 2012 (n=5; 17.24%). several technologies have been used to detect food and drug counterfeiting in single studies, including serialization, sms verification, rfid, and gsm. the conclusion has been reached that technological interventions have proven highly effective at combating drugs and food counterfeiting to a large degree. however, technological interventions against the counterfeiting of food were considerably lower than those against the counterfeiting of drugs. thus, it is necessary to perform studies on highly effective technologies in order to uncover ways of preventing counterfeit foods, such as blockchain, qr codes, mobile authentication services, internet of things (iot), laser, web-based, and 3d technologies. to help combat anti-counterfeiting through technologies, awareness, and knowledge about anti-counterfeiting technologies should be spread amongst the general public.","technology, counterfeiting, food",,"mona haji logistics and supply chain management department college of science and engineering hamad bin khalifa university doha, qatar mhaji@hbku.edu.qa",
172,An Evaluation Of The Performance Of A Safe Insulin Supply  Chain Through The Ahp-Topsis Model,"diabetes type 1 patients require insulin, a life-saving and essential medication, to maintain their blood sugar levels below dangerous levels, which allows them to live everyday life. there are significant issues with insulin supply and affordability in the industry, and as a result, patients and their families face an enormous burden. the high prices of insulin and the lack of availability have led many people to turn to other options for purchasing insulin, such as online pharmacies, which may or may not be legitimate due to their high prices and lack of availability. while diabetics need safe insulin in their legitimate pharmaceutical supply chain (psc), few researchers have considered implementing strategies to maximize patient safety when buying insulin in the legitimate pharmaceutical supply chain (psc). this is why the current research is intended to bridge this gap and provide cohesive information on improving insulin safety through the process of overcoming this challenge. this study employs a multi-criteria decision-making (mcdm) model that combines supply chain operations reference (scor) metrics, analytic hierarchy process (ahp), and technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (topsis) to develop a model that can prioritize and select the best criteria for maximizing insulin safety and achieving the study objective. there has been a comparison of two scenarios involving the insulin supply chain that has been carried out. as a result of this research, the integration of a traceability technology to the insulin supply chain, specifically blockchain (t42), in scenario 2 resulted in the best results for the supply chain for maximizing and ensuring the safety of insulin, as compared to scenario 1, where the final score was almost 71%. the research provided a valuable tool for assessing the safety of other critical goods that customers value in strategic and complex decision-making processes, enabling customers to make more informed decisions. researchers, professionals, and decision-makers can benefit from the results of this research when they can use a rigorous scientific decision-support system to make informed decisions.","technology, counterfeiting, food",,"mona haji logistics and supply chain management department college of science and engineering hamad bin khalifa university doha, qatar mhaji@hbku.edu.qa",

177,Mitigating Organizational And Operational Impediments To  Innovation: An Integrated Systems Approach,"operations work best when addressed from a systems perspective. innovation is pervasive and ubiquitous globally these days. unfortunately, the advertised potentials don’t always rise to the level of expectations because of organizational and operational impediments. this is particularly essential when unification is desired across boundaries of commerce, partnerships, and cooperation. in this regard, a system is a collection of interrelated elements whose collective output, together and in unison, is higher than the mere sum of the individual outputs. for a systems approach to be practical, profitable, realizable, and sustainable, systematic frameworks must be instituted, subject to real-world constraints. in as much as everyone is clamoring for innovation, it is imperative that effective approaches be utilized to harness quantitative and qualitative methodologies. in this presentation, the deji (design, evaluation, justification, and integration) systems model will be used as the basis for mitigating organizational and operational impediments to innovation. design, in this context, generically covers several objectives, including planning, conceptualization, organizing, brainstorming, negotiation, and so on. the systems approach of design leads to a structured requirement to conduct a formal evaluation, followed by a rigorous justification, followed by, above all, integration. programs often fail due to a lack of sustainable integration of efforts. the deji systems model forces a structured and rewarding approach to what could, otherwise, become disjointed efforts. with the structured methodology of this presentation, a practical decision framework can be developed. the deji systems model was originally developed for product development purposes, but it has been successfully applied in business, industry, academia, and government examples. viewing the accomplishments of any organization pursuit as “products,” it is envisioned that the template of deji could be effectively applied by any organization in business, industry, academia, government, or the military. embedded within the deji systems model is the triple-c approach of communication, cooperation, and coordination. literature references are plentiful for both techniques of deji systems model and triple-c model. this presentation will provide guidelines on how to apply both, together or separately, in organizational settings. authors’ bios melinda tourangeau is presently the executive director of rvj institute in milford, new hampshire. her career began in 1984 as an air force rotc scholarship recipient to georgia tech to study lasers to prepare her to work on president reagan’s star wars. her first assignment was at wright patterson afb, dayton, oh, to work in wrdc (now afrl) and then transition to afit. she has worked for four defense industry partners contributing her expertise in program management, electro-optics, and lasers. she is pursuing her phd in education to study technical leadership in industry. ms. tourangeau is an accomplished technical writer, public speaker, and business leader, devoted to mindful technical leadership for mutual benefit of the us military, industry, and the world. 683",,,"melinda l. tourangeau rvj institute, new hampshire mtourangeau@rvjinstitute.org adedeji b. badiru air force institute of technology, dayton, ohio adedeji.badiru@afit.edu; deji@badiru.com corresponding author: adedeji badiru, deji@badiru.com",
