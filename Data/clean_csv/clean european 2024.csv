It is an advanced and innovative approach that deploys new technologies, especially artificial intelligence and machine learning, to optimize and transform various aspects of the banking industry. Therefore, many banks are interested in incorporating AI in their system. It should be noted, however, that achieving this goal necessitates recognizing and resolving the challenges ahead. In the current study, an effort was made to identify the AI banking challenges, their evaluation criteria, and the available solutions to address them. To achieve this goal, library resources were reviewed and discussions were held with several banking experts to pinpoint the challenges, solutions, and effective criteria. Subsequently, an endeavor was undertaken to rank the AI banking challenges and evaluation criteria through the utilization of BWM. Additionally, DEA was employed to assess the efficacy of each solution in tackling the identified AI banking challenges. Furthermore, a bi-objective mathematical model was proposed for a more comprehensive analysis to select the most suitable solution for each challenge. This model had the capability to determine the optimal solution for any challenge by minimizing implementation costs and maximizing efficiency. Upon solving the model using the augmented 𝜀𝜀− constraint method and generating 10 Pareto solutions, the most effective one was chosen utilizing the DEA. Consequently, the Pareto solution 7 was identified as the most efficient option, and the most appropriate solution for each AI banking challenge was determined based on the outcomes of this solution. In order to better and more thoroughly approach AI banking, it is suggested to conduct further research using other assumptions and tools. For instance, it would be interesting to consider practical implications of these calculations and the non-deterministic nature of data. Also, one could use fuzzy DEA as a solution method. On the other hand, by understanding the existing challenges, one may apply an optimization model to select the appropriate solutions for each challenge while considering the budget constraints of each solution. Finally, simulation methods could be used in identifying challenges and solutions in order to approximate real-world conditions.","a systematic framework for meet the challenges of artificial intelligence banking mahdi bastan graduate school of management and economics, sharif university of technology tehran, iran mahdi.bastan@sharif.edu negin hasani and behnaz salimi school of industrial engineering, college of engineering university of tehran, tehran, iran negin.hasani@ut.ac.ir, behnaz.salimi@ut.ac.ir ali ghazizadeh school of industrial engineering iran university of science and technology, tehran, iran izadeh_ali@ind.iust.ac.ir ghaz mahdi hamid school of industrial engineering, college of engineering university of tehran, tehran, iran m.hamid31400@ut.ac.ir",

The authors first performed the exploratory data analysis and created four additional columns, namely T1, T2, T3, and T4, to record the durations of each application to the nearest week. The service time at each phase is further analyzed and used as input in the mathematical model. The sale applications are further categorized into three difficulty levels, C1, C2, and C3, and the respective service time for T2 and T3 are derived. The authors developed two mathematical models: Model 1 is based on one month time frame and model 2 is based on two-months duration. The aims of the two mathematical models are similar. We wanted to identify the total number of cases completed given the number of CSOs and the additional hours the sales department has to work overtime to meet all or, if not, a certain amount of demand. The generated model tries to maximise its dependency on the data provided by the company. Although resource utilisation is used to reflect the productivity level of the employees, it can also be adjusted when other factors are considered. The utilisation rate can be adjusted after the company adjusts the CSO workload, such as reducing the time they need to handle emails, calls, and appeals. The macro-level manpower planning model was further validated using the new four-month data, and the one-month model has been recommended as it yields better results and is easy to implement. It that we have developed has a mean absolute error rate of less than 5% , which is very favorable. The model that we developed has given the management a way to compute the time required systematically and has been deployed to use it in their planning. It can be further expanded to allow for other inputs such as the cost of current workers working overtime, or cost of hiring new employees to meet demand. The model should ultimately serve as a guide for the sales application team as it does not fully encompass the real situations on the ground level. Therefore, users should only refer to the model for determining a rough gauge on the required number of CSO for a certain amount of demand. Expanding the model can help the sales application team better understand the possible range of solutions for tackling their ever-changing environment.

In short, we can say that they are not happy or satisfied with their overall conditions and demands of their jobs. So, it’s very necessary for the managers to take this into mind and incorporate these into creating the Ergonomic VSM tool. For implementation of the new Ergonomic VSM, more employees should be hired and positioned at each station so that the existing workers don’t have to battle with unattainable timelines, too much workload etc. Also, the level of automation for the plant (to minimise human intervention) has to upgraded so that the workers do not have to handle such heavy loads physically or have to be constricted in awkward working postures and positions. Though these rapid improvements are surely eye-catching and encouraging for everyone but what’s vital about these improvements are sustaining such improvements in the long run. As time passes, new demands and practices will come into being where these ergonomics factor cannot be retained as their initial state of implementation and can also be overlooked. Hence, it’s totally up to the managers and supervisors to retain these ergonomics development and take care of the workers’ well-being all the time while prioritising productivity, costs, and quality.",ergonomic value stream map approach for productivity enhancement in ductile iron pipe industry,

It should be noted that if there is lack of commitment within the top brass of the organisation, chances are high that implementation of TQM will fail. It is therefore clear that management should lead by example and show their commitment in execution of their duties and should ‘walk the talk” as this will influence employees’ commitment towards implementation of TQM. The perception of management on quality will have an effect on improving employees’ quality awareness and that will difficult to implement TQM if 106","identifying the tqm strategies applied in the financial services sector. a case of the major banks in south africa teboho caswell chomane, andre vermeulen and jan harm c pretorius. postgraduate school of engineering management faculty of engineering and the built environment, university of johannesburg south africa tchomane@gmail.com, jhcpretorious@uj.ac.za, avermeulen.research@gmail.com","References

The research aimed to comprehensively analyze the application of project management techniques alongside an economic analysis of GIS-based system implementation to optimize Bisha's waste management system through improved operational efficiency, economic savings, and environmental sustainability. The rapid population growth and urban development in Bisha necessitate a sustainable approach to waste management. This paper assesses the effectiveness of a GIS-based smart system using project management techniques and economic analysis. By leveraging GIS technology and project management methodologies like CPM and PERT, cities can better address the challenges posed by increasing solid waste generation. By precisely identifying the critical path and allocating resources to those responsive components, the application of CPM and PERT methodologies in project management has improved efficiency and punctuality and resulted in a 9-month timeline reduction, from 63 months to 54 months. The system's economic analysis indicates a payback period of less than five years, indicating its worth within its expected 20-year lifespan. The approaches used with the smart waste management system based on GIS analysis provide a valuable tool for city planners and waste management authorities.

This demonstrates its potential for real-world deployment. Another important objective of the study was to detect fraudulent call activities on the network specifically targeting the international market. The implemented Random Forest model has exhibited exceptional accuracy, evident from the evaluation metrics on both the training and testing sets. The low Mean Absolute Error and Mean Squared Error on the training set reflect the model's ability to closely approximate actual values. Although there is a minor increase in errors on the testing set, the high R-squared value indicates a robust correlation between the predicted and actual values. These findings strongly align with the goal of creating a predictive model capable of effectively identifying fraudulent events on the network. The future of fraud detection will undoubtedly be transformed by AI and ML. These cutting-edge technologies will continuously progress, enabling increasingly effective identification and prevention of fraud. Telecommunication service providers are strongly advised to integrate and fully embrace these models into their systems to combat fraudulent activities and optimize revenue generation.

The highest utilized machine within the scheduling problem was identified and an analytical MILP model was formulated. Iteratively optimizing the production assets based on their utilization incorporates the assumption, that optimizing critical production assets is of higher priority than production assets with low criticality. The iterative approach reduces the complexity of the problem, and allows the usage of less qubits. A method to convert the MILP into a cost Hamiltonian was proposed and the results depending on different sets of 𝛽𝛽 and 𝛾𝛾 as well as their convergence were presented. To improve performance a WS-QAOA approach was presented, implemented, and compared to CS-QAOA. The WS-QAOA showed significantly better results in terms of convergence, energy, and probability of finding the best eigenstate, which is important since the depth of the quantum circuit grows linear with the amount of 𝛽𝛽 and 𝛾𝛾 parameters. The feasible prescheduling time slots only considered one parameter, worker availability, which could be enhanced easily to consider more, individual parameters, such as required maintenance equipment, skill levels or multiple workers. The proposed MILP was formulated in a general way, including complex conditions to determine the elements within 𝑉𝑉𝑖𝑖 can be incorporated easily. The modelling of the problem plays a significant role when implementing quantum computing into scheduling problems and trivial decision variables can be converted and included into the objective function to reduce the required amount of qubits. Further research could investigate the implementation of other quantum computing algorithms for smart maintenance scheduling, apply the approach to a real-world scenario for a manufacturing company or investigate approaches to efficiently deal with a high number of maintenance jobs to be considered, which could lead to a high number of required qubits to solve the problem.","integrating quantum computing into smart maintenance scheduling problems marius r. bernreuther hochschule reutlingen, esb business school, stellenbosch university reutlingen, baden-würtemberg, germany marius.bernreuther@student.reutlingen-university.de dominik lucke hochschule reutlingen, esb business school reutlingen, baden-würtemberg, germany dominik.lucke@reutlingen-university.de johannes l. jooste stellenbosch university stellenbosch, western cape, south africa wyhan@sun.ac.za",

Notably, ERP's contribution to system quality, information quality, and service quality is supported by robust statistical significance, as indicated by positive signed coefficients, Critical Ratio (CR) values, and p-values. These results align with existing research, including studies by Li et al. (2017), Modgil and Sharma (2017), and Beheshti and Beheshti (2010), confirming a positive correlation between ERP systems and enhanced organizational productivity. In conclusion, the case study affirms the effectiveness of leveraging ERP systems for productivity enhancement at SMEs such as DAS Pharma Plc. The significant and positive impacts on system quality, information quality, and service quality underscore the strategic importance of ERP integration in pharmaceutical operations. The findings do not only contribute to the growing body of knowledge on ERP systems integration but also provide empirical and practical insights for organizations aiming to improve productivity through technology adoption. As businesses continue to navigate competitive landscapes, the study reinforces the value of ERP as a key enabler for sustainable productivity gains in the pharmaceutical sector.","leveraging enterprise resource planning (erp) systems for productivity enhancement in small-medium pharmaceutical enterprises john k. buor research & lecturer university of ghana business school legon, accra, ghana jkbuor@ug.edu.gh enock selasi darteh quality assurance supervisor das pharma plc, accra, ghana selasidarteh@yahoo.com",

For the development of digital tools, it is very important to include the perspective of how the tools will be used. In the cases where digital tools are used to collect new data or to analyze existing data, SFM will often be where the results are monitored, and action is taken. When real-time alerts or predictions enable us to be become more proactive, or new tools increase our ability to cooperate, these tools must be integrated in the existing SFM structure in order to become effective. In summary it can be stated that a SFM that makes no use of digital tools does not use its full potential. On the other hand, digital tools that are not well integrated in SFM are very likely to lack effect and impact on production, because this is where action is taken on a daily basis. Only a close integration of SFM and digital tools in an integrated digital software framework will tap the full potential of both.","maturity steps towards a digitally integrated shop floor management dr.-ing. max dinkelmann senior inhouse consultant synchro germany m.sc. david weinmann head of corporate inhouse consulting synchro trumpf se + co. kg ditzingen, baden-württemberg germany",

Furthermore, the suggested compromise programming model's findings demonstrated that optimum solutions shift when the relative importance of environmental and socio-economic factors changes. The appropriate mix of alternative vehicles is a dynamic issue that calls for multi-stage solutions and evaluations of future circumstances. The overall findings indicate that the optimum distributions of the twenty-six options over the sixteen- weight scenarios clearly favor the CNG buses that have been recycled in India. In the scenario where environmental impacts are given supreme importance with 100% priority, the best fleet mix consists of 99% of the Sweden CNG bus recycled in India and 1% of the CNG made and recycled in India. However, when economic factors are prioritized, the Indian CNG bus, recycled in China, comprises 100% of the fleet. Despite this, when all the priority weight is put on the social parameters, the Turkish CNG recycled in India makes up more than 90% of the bus fleet. And last, in the scenario of balanced weighting, the Swedish CNG that was recycled in India accounts for more than 95% of the distribution. This research aims to provide a workable strategy incorporating hybrid LCSA and multi-objective optimization with different fixed weights to allocate the optimal transit bus distribution for Qatar. The authors also suggest separating the local impacts -that occur inside Qatar- in the optimization analysis from the Global supply chain impacts, which could give a different fleet distribution that serves the benefit of Qatar. 6.

This research was conducted in one of the municipalities in South Africa, and it is intended to assess the importance of stakeholder satisfaction in successfully implementing municipal projects. The importance of this research emanates from the notion that projects in local government are perceived to be challenging and sometimes face backlash from stakeholders or end users of the project (Amoatey & Hayibor, 2017). Literature was assimilated to understand the role of stakeholders in implementing municipal projects and how organisations are supposed to engage and manage stakeholders effectively. In this research, stakeholders were defined as anyone who has a vested interest in the outcome of the project (Heagney, 2016). Data was collected by using a survey questionnaire to identify and evaluate factors that are perceived to affect stakeholder satisfaction in municipal projects. 151 respondents who took part in the study were asked to provide answers to 24 questions that were related to factors that affect stakeholder satisfaction in the implementation of municipal projects. These factors were measured by assessing the perceptions of the municipality project population (their personal experience/views) on the factors that affect stakeholder satisfaction in implementing municipal projects. The factors were clustered as follows: Project success factors and the factors affecting stakeholders in implementing municipal projects. The research found that 8 of the 24 P-values are smaller than 0.05. As such, it can be concluded that 8 of the 24 factors shown in the table are significantly associated with factors that affect stakeholder satisfaction in implementing municipal projects at the 5% significance level. There is a need for enhancing monitoring to ensure that internal controls are adhered to, project risks are managed, and project deliverables are achieved. It is essential that municipal officials responsible for monitoring understand their roles, are equipped to perform their functions, are provided with the authority their role requires, and that the outcomes of monitoring and oversight are appropriately responded to. Implementing capital project milestones should be integrated with the capital budget, operating expenditure, reporting, and auditing. Quarterly progress reports should be provided to all relevant stakeholders, and municipal leadership should effectively communicate and provide feedback to stakeholders.","the importance of stakeholder satisfaction in successful implementation of municipal projects: a perspective of internal stakeholders kedumetsi lerato piitso department of quality and operations management university of johannesburg pretoria, south africa adopiitso@yahoo.com dr. emmanuel edoun research supervisor university of johannesburg johannesburg, south africa eiedoun@uj.ac.za dr. nelson mandonsela research co-supervisor university of johannesburg johannesburg, south africa nmadonsela@uj.ac.za",

By leveraging historical data and employing intelligent computer systems, companies can generate valuable insights into future product demands. This information is vital for optimizing inventory levels, production schedules, and resource allocation. Before the Covid-19 pandemic, these models effectively predicted future trends, empowering retail companies to plan effective strategies based on reliable forecasts. However, during the pandemic, none of the models were able to predict reliable values, but the Machine Learning models have lower errors. In scenarios involving long- term predictions, Machine Learning models outperformed traditional statistical models when trained with data that included the pandemic period, showcasing superior adaptability to outlier values. Conversely, when the pandemic period was excluded from the training data, the Holt-Winters model exhibited the best performance in predicting long- term values. It's still crucial to refine a model that can swiftly adapt to future outliers, such as the data from the Covid-19 period. None of the tested models, in this paper, have managed this effectively. By doing so, the market's resilience to future crises will be enhanced, enabling the formulation of better strategies for navigating such periods. If the models were able to adapt for external information, as the investment made by the Brazilian government to support the pandemic, the retail sector would has a predict view to help the decision and strategies in that moment, because, with the current 543","analysis and forecasting of the brazilian household appliance sector using machine learning models icaro de jesus gomes do bonfim and orlando yesid esparza albarracín department of production engineering university presbyterian mackenzie são paulo, brazil ijgbomfim@hotmail.com, orlando.albarracin@mackenzie.br","References

This problem is a hard problem, and we aim to propose an approach which can quickly provide a valid upper bound on this worst- case routing cost. The approach we propose, uses ideas from mixed integer nonlinear optimization and constructs a convex relaxation of the original problem which can be solved in an efficient manner. Our computation results on real service networks are encouraging. We observe that for single link failure scenarios the proposed approach is exact to the optimal routing cost, however for higher number of link failures, the approach gives useful and quick bounds on the optimal coast. We believe that this approach can help design more reliable and cost-efficient routing schemes for the service networks.","robust optimization for cost validation in designing service networks ashish chandra college of business illinois state university normal, il 61761, usa achand6@ilstu.edu",

This is a much-needed change to answer emergency responses and be resilient. Hence, in this paper, we presented how digital transformation can be achieved to make a significant impact across various elements of the food supply chain. Given the MENA region's limited agricultural resources, digital transformation of the food supply chain represents a viable solution to mitigate challenges. From a supply chain management perspective, such, streamlined inventory management, demand forecasting, and efficient supplier relations, can increase profitability considerably. Distributor logistics including routing and delivery can be optimized based on factors like traffic conditions, delivery schedules, and customer preferences, reducing transportation costs and delivery times. Key technologies identified for this digital transformation of FSC are IoT, blockchain, robotics, unified communications, and AI.","digital transformation is the key to resilient food supply chains: a case study of the mena region shoaa nasser a m heedan, regina padmanabhan, majed hadid and laoucine kerbache college of science and engineering hamad bin khalifa university, qatar shhe51891@hbku.edu.qa, rpadmanabhan@hbku.edu.qa, mahadid@hbku.edu.qa, lakerbache@hbku.edu.qa",

However, to be able to undertake such rankings required the establishment of the relevant criteria based on which competing supply chain mobile apps could be rated on. Upon an extensive literature search and building upon the criteria of MARS as proposed by Stuyanov et al (2017), five main criteria, namely Engagement, Functionality, Aesthetics, Information, and Security were agreed on by experts to be the most important. The sub-criteria under each of the main criteria were also established. The relative importance weights of the main and the sub-criteria were then determined using the fuzzy AHP method resulting in Functionality seen as the most important of the five main criteria, followed by Security, then Information and Engagement in a tie, and lastly Aesthetics as the least important among the five criteria. Similar rankings were done for all the sub-criteria of the main criteria. The established criteria and the importance weights were employed in a fuzzy TOPSIS method to evaluate the performance of six supply chain management mobile apps selected from Apple Store and Google Play Store resulting in the app Store Manager judged as the one with the best overall performance. The developed fuzzy MARS method by this paper is not only practical but also easy to use as it is built on well- established techniques of AHP and TOPSIS. One of the most important contributions of this study is the establishment of the relevant criteria for evaluating supply chain mobile apps. As stated, these were arrived at after an extensive literature search and input from supply chain management experts. It must be acknowledged that the number of experts who ranked the criteria could have been increased and likewise the medium of selection of the supply chain mobile apps for ranking could have also been expanded, suggesting that it is likely that the importance weights and therefore the ranking of the criteria and the competing supply chain mobile apps could change.","a fuzzy mcdm rating method for supply chain mobile apps anthony afful-dadzie, eric afful-dadzie and stephen kobby kove department of operations management and information systems university of ghana business school lg 78, accra, ghana",

Although AI chatbots provide prospective advantages such as increased productivity, greater communication, and cost reduction, the process of implementing them is hindered by barriers such as expensive installation costs, limited technical knowledge, and concerns around data protection. By addressing these challenges through targeted strategies like capacity building, pilot projects, and securing external support, NGOs can better navigate the complexities of AI chatbot adoption. The research highlights the importance of continuous training, clear communication, and robust ethical guidelines to ensure successful implementation and sustainable use of AI technologies. Future research should focus on expanding sample diversity, conducting longitudinal studies, and exploring technical and ethical aspects in greater depth to further support NGOs in leveraging AI chatbots for enhanced service delivery and operational efficiency.","factors influencing the adoption of ai chatbots by non- governmental organizations macdonald dube, sibusisiwe dube and belinda ndlovu national university of science and technology, bulawayo, zimbabwe n0181248x@students.nust.ac.zw, sibusisiwe.dube@nust.ac.zw, belinda.ndlovu@nust.ac.zw",
69,7Th European Conference On Industrial Engineering And Operations Management  Doi: 10.46254/Eu07.20240156,"mental health issues affect university students, particularly from developing countries, who are mostly faced with social, economic, and environmental challenges, which significantly impact students’ academic performance and well- being. furthermore, the literature shows that seeking professional mental health support is usually associated with excessive costs and stigmatization. moreover, existing generic chatbots do not address the specific contextual needs of students. this paper therefore presents a chatbot tailored for students from a developing country context. qualitative data were collected from ten final-year undergraduate students with a mental breakdown who are currently enrolled at a single university case in zimbabwe. a thematic analysis of collected data provided key constructs for designing a chatbot that employs natural language understanding techniques to afford university students a convenient platform for acquiring mental health support. kanban methodology was employed to develop the machine learning chatbot using the rasa open-source framework which is a development framework that provides open-source tools and libraries for building conversational chatbots, leveraging a collection of different pre-trained and customizable machine-learning models for varying tasks within the chatbot such as intent classification, entity recognition, and natural language understanding. the findings from this research reveal that university students appreciate this innovative approach that promotes a private and user-friendly environment for their mental health care. the findings also suggest that students who experience mental breakdown only prefer to use chatbots as an alternative intervention rather than a replacement for mental health professionals due to the unpredictable performance of chatbots, which sometimes results in inconsistent and varying solutions for mental health care. these findings add value to the knowledge body and impact university students who can now freely access mental health support without stigmatization. the parents or guardians of affected students can now be relieved from incurring high costs for some avoidable professional mental health services for their children. lecturers can lecture and impart knowledge to mentally relieved, present, and attentive students. the findings also add to the university management’s understanding of the student's mental health needs and, can be able to strategize policies aimed at minimizing students’ mental breakdown and recurrences.","chatbot, mental health, support, encouragement","This study introduced a mental health Chatbot for university students’ mental health support and encouragement. Chatbot was made to employ natural language understanding behavioral activation, and self-confidence training. This will help the students better manage their feelings, thoughts, and actions and improve their quality of life. The study also examined the effectiveness of mental health Chatbots in addressing and reducing mental health challenges among university students. The findings indicated users generally accepted the use of mental health Chatbots if they are not used as a standalone but as a complement for professional mental health services during times of distress and when they need some knowledge related to mental health and coping mechanisms. However, more research to fully understand the long-term effectiveness of chatbots in handling mental health issues can be further explored as the behavior of the chatbots differs and mental distress affects individuals differently. Furthermore, integrating a chatbot with existing university support systems is also necessary. There is also a need for University Program Recommendation systems such as (Ndlovu et al. 2023) in addition to considering personality type and academic results, to incorporate a student's mental health status. By understanding a student's current mental well- being, the system could recommend programs or resources that can better support their academic success and overall well-being. This could include recommending programs that focus on stress management, time management, or study skills, depending on the student's specific needs. However, cyber security, privacy and awareness concerns need to be addressed to safeguard the use of these systems (Maguraushe 2024). This chatbot can be integrated with the Cybersecurity and Awareness Framework (Mutunhu et al. 2022) to provide students with information on identifying and avoiding cyber threats, protecting their personal information, and practicing safe online habits. By promoting digital literacy alongside mental health support, the chatbot can contribute to a more well-rounded student experience.","mental health chatbot for university students support and encouragement tapiwa tauro, belinda ndlovu and belinda ndlovu department of informatics and analytics national university of science and technology p.o box ac939, ascot, bulawayo, zimbabwe belinda.ndlovu@nust.ac.zw, sibusisiwe.dube@nust.ac.zw fungai jacqueline kiwa department of ict and electronics chinhoyi university of technology private bag 7724, chinhoyi, zimbabwe jkiwa@cut.ac.zw",

In the past few years, governments started opting for more sustainable and renewable energy sources to fight global warming and contribute to achieving the Paris Agreement goals. In parallel, solar energy has become a more accessible and viable option for various countries. However, some developing countries lack modern equipment and methods to help forecast solar radiation, which is pivotal for solar energy installations and projects. Consequently, this paper aims to develop and compare various deep learning univariate models, namely ANN, CNN, and LSTM, to predict the hourly GHI in the city of Tustin, California. The study employed RMSE as a performance measure to facilitate the models’ comparison. The findings suggested that ANN produces the lowest performance, as indicated by the high RMSE value of 317.53. In contrast, both CNN and LSTM produced comparable performance with RMSE values of 71 and 76.18, respectively. The findings of the paper can hold significant implications for sustainable and renewable energy advocates interested in solar energy installation projects in the city of Tustin or any other city with comparable climate conditions. Moreover, the paper contributes to the academic literature on solar radiation predictions and estimations by deploying three univariate deep-learning approaches to predict the hourly GHI.

It improves performance, reduces costs, and optimizes traffic flow. The algorithm uses pheromones to represent route desirability, which are dynamically adjusted through decay processes and simulation to continuously optimize the transportation network. Inspired by the collective intelligence of ant colonies, this algorithm offers resource-efficient, time-effective, and cost-saving route selection techniques. By leveraging this approach, transportation networks can achieve resource-optimized, time-efficient, and cost-effective transportation. The algorithm aims to revolutionize route selection techniques, bringing flexibility and efficiency to transportation networks by drawing from the collective intelligence of ant colonies. This innovative approach has the potential to enhance transportation networks and their economic and environmental impacts. The algorithm's success is demonstrated through various numerical metrics, including exploration-exploitation balance, average journey time, total waiting time, route diversity, and convergence rate. Its dual-objective optimization methodology, which combines traditional emphasis on travel time with consideration of fuel consumption, sets it apart. This unique combination provides a more comprehensive and environmentally sensitive approach to route selection, advancing the field of intelligent transportation systems. The future scope of the proposed ACO-inspired algorithm for route selection in transportation networks is vast and holds potential for significant advancements in the field of intelligent transportation systems. Some potential future directions and enhancements include: (a) integrating the algorithm with smart city initiatives to create more efficient and sustainable transportation systems that are integrated with other urban systems; (b) integrating machine learning techniques to enhance the algorithm's ability to learn and adapt to changing transportation patterns and user preference.

With its given data, this study was able to conclude the current weakness of the company. The study focused on the blocked rate and determined that it needs to be reduced so that the operation rate of the company would increase. This study concluded the following from the different models. 1. From the current model of a 3PL service company, the study identified that the blocked rate of the company was higher than the operation rate of the current model. The identified blocked rate of the current model was 74.33% while the operation rate was 22.44% The study identified the total package release as 36 packages and identified that the manufacturing model of the company was a progressive assembly. According to Ekren and Ornek (2008), identifying performance measures through simulation allows a better understanding of the company being reviewed. By identifying the blocked rate, the study was able to determine the point for improvements It was also stated by Werbinska (2007) that time-redundancy due to downtime leads to the inefficiency of logistic services. 2. The proposed model of this study stems from the batch production manufacturing model where only another type of process will be accommodated if all the packages are finished on that particular process. The closest study that was ever conducted in applying the principles of batch production was the article by Li et. al. (2015). The synchronous process aims to coordinate each process time to be aligned with other processors as it was studied by Anandarajah et. al. (2007) that time synchronization improves process control. 3. The proposed model of this study resulted in a package release of 69 packages. The proposed model identified the values of in move logic, in operation, in blocked rate with values of 12.58%, 41.02%, and 46.41%. 4. The difference between the current and the proposed model was 24 additional package release. The blocked rate reduction was 27.47% and there was an increase in operation rate which was 17.99% while the in-move logic increased by 9.48%. The proposed model of the study was also under the same assumption that there will be the same number of employees and locations therefore making it very feasible for the company to adapt the model. This study concluded that the progressive assembly may be ineffective if the blocked rate of each location was high, which the study analyzed and understood that a synchronized process model that incorporates the idea of batch production would be effective. According to Cochran (2001), understanding the relationship between elements of a system design is important. The study understood that the blocked rate of the manufacturing model proves to be the greatest obstacle the company faces and just cannot be solved easily by changing processes. The study shifted its focus on the conceptual use of the company’s manufacturing model and took into consideration the limitations the company faces in providing a suitable manufacturing model which was the synchronous process model. This effectively reduced the blocked rate and allowed more released packages by the company. Simply, the study focused on the capability of manpower to effectively utilize different processes for each worker rather than designating a person into a specific process. By evening the workload to every worker since they are capable of doing each process, the study achieved synchronization between each process which effectively addresses the buildups and delays. The application of the conceptual use of batch production which may referred to here in the study as batch processing proves that synchronized processing can be utilized in the case of increased processing time for each assembly location especially for those companies that face manpower limitations and space constraints. The study explores the conceptual use of batch processing for companies that heavily rely on manpower and effectively utilize this concept to address multiple issues at once.","process enhancement using promodel simulation: a case study of a third-party logistic service company in the philippines mark jherald acilo, trishia anne marie cobalida, rhiza anne barbara lopez, jake quijano, nikko luis tabasa and maricar m. navarro industrial engineering technological institute of the philippines quezon city, mnl 1109, philippines qmjacilo@tip.edu.ph, qtamcombalida@tip.edu.ph, qrablopez@tip.edu.ph, jjquijano@tip.edu.ph, qnltabasa@tip.edu.ph, mnavarro.ie@tip.edu.ph",

As determined by Haekal, J. (2021), software integration has helped us in determining the bottlenecks, resource allocation optimization, and production scheduling improvement with new facility layout. These examinations feature the potential time reserve funds that are feasible by executing the proposed changes. Changes in the upper-part sewing alone, for instance, could significantly shorten production times from a regular and standard perspective, indicating significant gains in efficiency. In the primary proposed process, the potential time reserve funds mean a remarkable improvement in effectiveness, adding to the general upgrade of the assembling system. Similarly, the operations that benefit from the second proposed procedure save even more time, indicating a significant improvement in efficiency metrics.

86,7Th European Conference On Industrial Engineering And Operations Management  Doi: 10.46254/Eu07.20240183,"this paper delves into the amalgamation of green supply chain management (gscm) practices and enforcement of german lksg (lieferkettensorgfaltspflichtengesetz) environmental regulations in small and medium-sized enterprises (smes) operating within supply chains. incorporating literature across multiple studies, a majority have shown to be vital factors critically affecting the economic, environmental, operational, and gscm domains. the paper has investigated the application of machine learning methods to promote the direction and strength of these factors’ influences on one another. the findings are presented in terms of sem frameworks or models previously employed by other researchers that enable easy establishment of correlations as well as feedback loops through cld representation. such an inclusive approach brings new insight into regulatory adjustment dynamics among smes and their financial performance. seven feedback loops explain how gscm principles interact with regulatory compliance to produce financial results. the objective for this study is to enlighten policy makers both locally and internationally about this scenario so that they can better enforce policies that will help businesses to operate more sustainably while minimizing risks related with non-compliance.","supply chain, sustainability, system dynamics",", this research has investigated the complex and multi-faceted relationship between new environmental legislation, namely the German LkSG, and the intrinsic operations of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in supply chains. Building on an extensive literature review, a total of 19 critical factors expected have been defined and studied to evolve under the auspices of the legislation. By using a combination of structural equation modeling (SEM) and distilling a selection of findings into causal loop diagrams, study has enriched the understanding of the associations and feedback mechanisms of the relevant factors. The paper has thereby provided a holistic framework for managers to navigate the broader implications of environmental regulation for SMEs while attending the operations of their core business. This research has brought out a challenge-based view of the factors awaiting significant changes and has outlined ways SME operators and decision-makers could minimize or resolve their impacts. The paper has discussed the options of securing ISO 14001 certification, deployed green logistics and transportation measures, and proposed the most relevant route for adoption in the form of a tool kit. Subsequent to this, the paper has melded all the insights into a causal loop diagram, providing a comprehensive view of the causal relationships across multiple scenarios in every factor. In terms of future research, the paper proposes integrating machine learning (ML) techniques to delve deeper into the financial repercussions for supply chain SMEs. In particular, it is recommended for exerting negative influences on profits and the countervailing strategies adopted by SME operators to offset their profit-shrinking impacts. By integrating causality, feedback mechanisms and learning models, this research seeks to provide a more unified view of environmental regulatory compliance and cost implications. This would be very useful to help more informed decisions related to compliance with new regulations while ensuring the survival and sustainability of SMEs going forward in fast-evolving business climates. Future research could use the principles of ISO 14044 to advance understanding of the environmental impact on SMEs in the supply chain. By following established life cycle assessment (LCA) methods, researchers can delve deeper into the environmental footprint of materials and processes. This allows a comparison between the mitigation strategies proposed in this study, leading to a robust decision-making process. Furthermore, incorporating a social perspective into broader sustainability strategies in SMEs can enhance their environmental performance when considering socio- economic factors. Specifically, the benefits of ISO 14044 principles provide a structured framework for LCA, which facilitates informed decision-making and facilitates the transition to sustainable business practices in the SMEs’ supply chains.","a causal analytics approach for monetary performance analysis of smes under the implementation of supply chain sustainability regulations ardalan irani and omid fatahi valilai school of business, social & decision sciences constructor university bremen campus ring 1, 28759, bremen, germany",

98,7Th European Conference On Industrial Engineering And Operations Management  Doi: 10.46254/Eu07.20240201,"plastic waste is one of the major constituents of environmental pollution due to the increasing applications of plastic material in today's economy. regulation and customer preferences compelled firms to use recycled plastic (rp) for sustainable production and a circular economy. companies have already started using recycled plastic from the market in the open-loop supply chain system, but they are facing issues in managing that with the current planning system due to unpredictable variations in quality, quantity, lead time, and prices. as a result, their production system is affected by shortages, increasing waste, high maintenance costs, and poor product quality, which ultimately results in high cost and customer loss for circular businesses. this paper first identifies the sources of these variations in the supply of rp to guide industrial experts and practitioners to avoid when transforming businesses from linear to circular systems. ineffective recycling processes, inexperienced recyclers, competition against incineration, and a poor supply market are the main problems that make the supply chain more vulnerable. secondly, a strategic framework is developed based on infrastructure design, technology, production planning, product design, supplier integration, and customer engagement to guide firms in making their production system and supply chain resilient against the uncertain supply of rp in closed-loop supply chain management.","recycled plastic, circular economy","The research work goes through reviewing the challenges faced by the current plastic firms to manage the RP in the supply chain. There are many reasons for these uncontrollable variations from the suppliers’ end and associated uncertainties in production, which affect the resilience and performance of the production system. It analyzes how the current production system is rigid and incapable of managing the RP consisting of heterogeneous recycling content. Mitigation strategies are recommended for the firms to deal with the uncertainties produced by the variations in the supply for the consumption of RP without disruption for the successful transition towards the circular economy. It is also recommended to transform the supply businesses from an open-loop to a closed-loop system by developing a supply chain infrastructure. Transitioning to a circular economy requires a fundamental shift in how firms manage production processes and supply chains. By adopting flexible production systems, information technology for sharing data with suppliers and customers, product design for recycling, process optimization and flexibility, lean operations, and supply infrastructure, firms can better manage the uncertainties associated with heterogeneous recycling content. Coupled with innovative business models and supportive regulatory frameworks, these strategies will enable firms to mitigate disruptions and achieve a successful transition towards a more sustainable and circular economic model. The research is based on the literature reviews and the results are significant for decision-makers to transform their supply chain from a linear to a circular economy in a closed-loop supply chain of RP. There are future research avenues associated with the findings of the work. The variations and associated uncertainties can be identified and ranked for the benefit of the firms to consider only significant challenges for further improving the production system. Multicriteria decision tools, Pareto fronts, fuzzy systems, and other techniques can be utilized to identify and prioritize significant decisions. Systematic data collection using designed questionnaires and conducting interviews with industrial experts are required to further extend the application of the work for managing supply-based variations. These uncertainties can be converted into measurable risks to provide proactive strategies related to production and supply chain to avoid the variations and associated uncertainties using risk management analysis. 953","uncertain supply of recycled plastic: challenges and mitigation strategies for adopting plastic circular economy muhammad omair and brian vejrum wæhrens department of materials and production, aalborg university | fibigerstræde 16 | 9220 aalborg, denmark muhammado@mp.aau.dk, bvw@mp.aau.dk","References

Even when it appears that the process is stable and runs smoothly, then comes the reality and fact that AMRs don’t run on air! They need to be charged from time to time. Reduced number of available AMRs causes longer pick up times. In order to maintain interruption-free continuous production with the highest priority, an increase of output buffers was necessary. That caused an increased need for available pallets. And the addition of pallets is more economical than the addition of additional production machines. Theoretically it’s possible to increase the number of resources endlessly, but practically, which one of these is the most cost-efficient? That’s a question along with continuous induction floor recharging for another research. 1037","witness horizon 25 des simulation modeling of centrally dispatched automated mobile robots tomasz kantoch production systems and digitalization zf automotive germany gmbh alfdorf, germany tomasz.kantoch@zf.com neil g. murray jr. a. leon linton department of mechanical, robotics and industrial engineering lawrence technological university southfield, mi 48075, usa nmurray@ltu.edu passive safety electronics senior technical specialist zf corporation farmington hills, mi 48331, usa neil.murray@zf.com","References

The layout reorganization, based on the SLP, reduced cycle time from 15.5 minutes to 12.1 minutes, and travel time from 30.5 minutes to 19.6 minutes. In addition, the reprocessing rate decreased from 15.9% to 5.16% for machine 1, and from 13.3% to 3.57% for machine 2, evidencing a considerable improvement in product quality. These results translate into an increase in daily production capacity from 690 to 895 garments, and an increase in production efficiency from 68.5% to 88.8%. The research carried out is of great importance for the SME clothing sector in Peru and other developing countries, where competitiveness and operational efficiency are crucial for economic sustainability. The adoption of lean manufacturing practices allows these companies not only to improve their productivity and quality, but also to reduce costs and production times. This is especially relevant in a globalized market where rapid and efficient response capacity can determine the viability of small and medium-sized enterprises. In addition, reducing defects and improving the organization of the workplace contribute to a safer and more motivating working environment for employees. Contributions to the field of study include a clear and replicable methodology for process optimization in the garment industry, using lean manufacturing tools. This study provides empirical evidence on the benefits of rearranging production layout and applying error-proofing techniques such as Poka Yoke. In addition, it provides a framework for the implementation of 6S audits, which significantly improve the organization and safety in the work area. The research also highlights the importance of a systematic and data-based approach to identifying and mitigating root causes of production inefficiencies. Concluding remarks and suggestions for future studies include the need to explore the application of Industry 4.0 technologies in combination with Lean Manufacturing, to further enhance the efficiency and responsiveness of clothing SMEs. Additional studies could focus on the implementation of real-time monitoring systems for early detection of defects and dynamic optimization of production processes. It would also be beneficial to investigate the integration of lean techniques with environmental sustainability strategies, to address not only operational efficiency but also ecological responsibility in the garment industry. 1059","optimization of the clothing production line in peruvian smes through the implementation of lean manufacturing: a case study santiago bravo de rueda-alarcon bachelors in industrial engineering faculty of engineering, universidad de lima, peru 20163290@aloe.ulima.edu.pe martín fidel collao-díaz research professor faculty of engineering, universidad de lima, peru mcollao@ulima.edu.pe","References

107,7Th European Conference On Industrial Engineering And Operations Management  Doi: 10.46254/Eu07.20240216,"the small and medium-sized enterprises (smes) in the automotive maintenance service sector are essential for the global economy and particularly for peru. these smes face significant challenges related to inefficiency in their maintenance processes, often resulting in high levels of unproductive time and inadequate workflow management. this study arises from the need to optimize the operational efficiency of these businesses through the implementation of planning and continuous improvement methodologies. the main contribution of this research is the development and implementation of a service model based on the pdca (plan-do-check-act) cycle, complemented by systematic layout planning (slp) and value stream mapping (vsm) techniques. this structured model allowed the identification and elimination of non-value-added activities, optimization of workshop layout, and improvement of workflow efficiency. the most outstanding results of the model implementation include a 30% reduction in distances traveled within the workshop, a 15% decrease in service cycle times, a 10% increase in customer satisfaction, and a 5% improvement in overall operational efficiency. these indicators demonstrate that the proposed model not only addressed inefficiency issues but also established a solid foundation for future optimizations, aligning with lean service principles and ensuring the sustainability of long-term improvements.",pdca cyle,"The main findings of the study showed that the implementation of the Systematic Layout Planning (SLP) methodology and the PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) cycle significantly improved operational efficiency in automotive service workshops. The initial analysis revealed that the operational efficiency of the studied workshops was 88.5%, considerably below the industry standard of 93% (Tripathi et al., 2022). The implementation of SLP and PDCA reduced travel times by 30%, resulting in a decrease in cycle time and an increase in overall efficiency. In addition, the redesign of the layout and the optimization of the workflow resulted in a reduction of the total service time and an improvement in customer satisfaction. These results highlight the importance of a structured and systematic approach to addressing inefficiencies in vehicle maintenance processes. The research conducted is crucial for the small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) sector of automotive maintenance, especially in regions such as Latin America, where these companies are vital to the local economy. Adopting Lean Service practices and implementing the PDCA cycle not only improve operational efficiency, but also increase the competitiveness and sustainability of SMEs. By reducing downtime and optimizing resources, companies can deliver better service, resulting in higher customer satisfaction and loyalty. In addition, improved operational efficiency contributes to cost savings, allowing SMEs to reinvest in advanced maintenance technologies and practices, in line with Industry 4.0 trends. Contributions to the field of study include the validation of the SLP methodology and the PDCA cycle as effective tools for improving operational efficiency in the automotive maintenance sector. This study provides empirical evidence on the benefits of a systematic layout reorganization and the implementation of a continuous improvement approach. It also highlights the importance of involving all staff in the improvement process, promoting a culture of collaboration and commitment. The research also highlights the relevance of using analytical and process mapping tools to identify and address the root causes of inefficiencies, facilitating data-driven decision making. Concluding remarks and suggestions for future studies include the need to explore the integration of digital technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI), into automotive maintenance processes. These technologies can provide real-time data and predictive analytics, further improving operational efficiency and enabling more effective preventive maintenance. In addition, future studies could investigate the application of these approaches in different contexts and sizes of enterprises, as well as in other service sectors.

That's why the increase in time a user spends sitting correctly, facilitated by the implementation and use of an ergonomic backrest observed during the experimentation of this accessory, can reduce the occurrence of lumbar injuries. Lumbar injuries were identified as predominant in workers who perform tasks in a static posture at a workstation. This type of pain is due to compression of the L4/L5 and L5/S1 vertebrae caused by sitting in the same posture for hours. Therefore, the pressure of this posture was reduced by better distributing the participants' load when using the ergonomic backrest and supporting themselves correctly. Likewise, through the statistical tests of this study, it was determined that participants were able to maintain concentration for longer periods while performing their tasks. Additionally, it was observed that all participants were constantly moving due to the discomfort caused by the seat without the ergonomic accessory, this problem was significantly reduced upon implementing the backrest and observing that participants moved less frequently, maintained a correct posture for a longer period, and were more focused on performing the task. 1079","design of an ergonomic back support o prevent lumbar injuries gino leonardo solis sparrow facultad de ingeniería universidad de lima lima, perú 20181817@ulima.edu.pe jair dario angeles morales facultad de ingeniería universidad de lima lima, perú 20182246@ulima.edu.pe marcos fernando ruiz-ruiz associate professor universidad de lima lima, perú mruiz@ulima.edu.pe óscar eduardo sakay rodríguez advisor kansei analytics 10833 hillrose ave, baton rouge, la 70810, usa akisakai@gmail.com","References

The way to go with issues such as long queues and turnarounds is to automate the flow of work and increase efficiency. Through the analytical data and the inspection, we can use multiple paths for a more efficient flow of the process and a more efficient use of assets. Periodical evaluation of the manufacturing process and the implementation of continuous modernization are key factors in getting a full advantage from it by producing high- quality products as originally set. Observing literature that used Tecnomatix for testing production lines or manufacturing facilities, revealed the significant use of simulation as an Industry 4.0 solution. Our work on Tecnomatix was a significant contributor to the design of our manufacturing facility. The model built helped us grasp a better understanding of the material flow, worker flow, and resource statistics. By adjusting different parameters in the model we were able to identify the effect between the number of workers and the throughput.

For instance, the KUKA iiwa controller is yet to be replaced by a suitable emulation, or if not available by a physical Simulation. A suitable interface must also be configured for the simulation or emulation and implemented into the toolchain. Moreover the MES system currently running on another computer can be transferred to the host computer of the digital twin. This would enable centralized control and management of the entire system and the twin. Completing these steps achieves a digital twin further towards bidirectional coupling and a corresponding extension of the RAMI definition. A closed loop control communication between the virtual model data, services and the physical entities is possible by implementing intelligent interconnections (Zhang et al., 2022). This can provide the basis for further research on the existing digital twin and the introduction of corresponding data mining algorithms. As a result, the digital twin can be expanded to include an edge connection, which offers many new possibilities and is a prerequisite for linking the digital twin with IoT technologies (Li et al., 2022). Consequently, the digital twin can also be designed smarter in the future, whereby, for example, it can also make decisions itself by means of an agent system and thus carry out orders autonomously. As a result, it can increasingly become essential for future manufacturing, as described by Kagermann at the beginning, and support the megatrends of manufacturing already mentioned. 7.","conceptional design and prototypical implementation of a digital twin for a modular manufacturing system michael reisig, jürgen h. lenz and florian kerber technical university of applied science augsburg nördlingen, germany michael.reisig1@tha.de, juergen.lenz@tha.de, florian.kerber@tha.de",

It is not clearly defined as a process what the results mean for the product. Additionally, uncertainties complicate the traceability, as there can be situations where the validation activities become obsolete because the product has been further developed. These field of actions can be utilized to develop future methods, processes, and tools for the early and continuous validation of product profiles by defining each field of action as a success factor. 6. Conclusion and Outlook In summary, the three research questions addressed in this publication have been answered. Regarding the first research question, a total of nine challenges in the continuous validation of product profiles were identified and described. These were utilized to address the second research question by connecting the identified challenges with those of the early phase from the literature. The influences on how the challenges of continuous validation are amplified were described. Based on this connection, four action fields for the continuous and early validation of product profiles were subsequently described. These action fields serve as starting points for the development of new methods, processes, and tools for continuous and early validation of product profiles. By answering the research questions, the research objective of this publication was achieved by deriving action fields for continuous and early validation of product profiles. However, there are further open points that need to be addressed in future research activities. Firstly, the challenges and action fields need to be evaluated and new ones need to be added from an industry perspective to obtain a valid starting point. Surveys and interviews can be conducted for the evaluation of the identified challenges as well as of the action fields and for the addition of new challenges or field of actions. This can help to further specify the descriptions of the action fields. Secondly, based on the action fields, goals, requirements, and constraints for methods, processes, and tools can be derived. Following the DRM - Design Research Methodology by Blessing and Chakrabarti (2009), these can be defined for application, support, and success. Furthermore, these goals, requirements, and constraints can be further specified through a practical view of the action fields.","fields of action in the continuous and early validation of product profiles in product engineering stefan eric schwarz, carsten thümmel, maximilian kuebler, benjamin doostkam and albert albers ipek – institute of product engineering karlsruhe institute of technology (kit) 76131 karlsruhe, germany stefan.schwarz@kit.edu, carsten.thuemmel@kit.edu, maximilian.kuebler@kit.edu, uclrs@student.kit.edu, albert.albers@kit.edu",

(2022). Firstly, it is specified that by using the qualitative risk identification and estimation matrix, it was possible to determine that the activities of LPG injection, quality control and sealing, in addition to the stacking of packaged cylinders, were the most critical tasks in the packaging process, since they presented a significant risk that meant taking immediate corrective actions. With the activities defined in the evaluation, the risk level was quantified using the RULA and NIOSH tools, where the lack of information and awareness about efficient ergonomics management at work was also witnessed. The use of these tools is consistent with the study by Lara-Lezcano et al. (2023) where it is evident that the quantification of the risk level of the activities under study was possible through methodologies of ergonomic scope. The results of this article indicated that immediate changes were required in the performance of tasks with greater criticality, since the consequences involved a decrease in physical capacity, musculoskeletal disorders and, consequently, a level of productivity below the goal established by the company. . After the implementation of the improvements, the proposals were validated to identify that the level of postural risk was reduced and thus improvements in productivity. On the one hand, the LPG injection activities, as well as quality control and sealing, reduced the risk level by 71.4% in both activities, the risk levels with a score of 7 were reduced to 2. On the other hand, the The activity of stacking packaging balloons had a reduction in the lifting index from 4,793 to 2,445, equivalent to a reduction of 48.9%, this as a result of the load weight no longer requiring the lifting of two balloons simultaneously. Finally, the preliminary test was carried out with the objective of analyzing the new productivity, an average increase of 10.4% in productivity was evident, as well as a reduction in average packaging time of 27.5%. In this way, the new productivity index results in 88.4%, exceeding the target indicator established by the company under study. Based on the final results, it was possible to corroborate that with the implementation of an ergonomic model based on ergonomic methodologies, evaluation and analysis of the most critical jobs, greater productivity and a lower risk of harm to collaborators can be obtained, validating the study by Loa-Puris et al. (2021) that presents the evaluation of overexertion and postures in order to propose an ergonomic model design in the LPG cylinder injection and painting position in a plant in the hydrocarbon sector, evidencing improvements in its productivity.","dysergonomic risk management model to improve productivity in the liquefied petroleum gas balloon filling process using rula and niosh methodologies claudia matamoros mejia and cristian roman justo facultad de ingeniería, carrera de ingeniería industrial universidad de lima, lima perú 20163295@aloe.ulima.edu.pe, 20163235@aloe.ulima.edu.pe carlos augusto lizárraga portugal research proffesor facultad de ingeniería industrial universidad de lima, lima perú clizarra@ulima.edu.pe",

It is crucial to identify potential risks that might arise from warehouse operational activities and affect warehouse operational performance. In this study, we utilized the Warehouse Performance Analysis model to explore warehouse risks from time, quality, cost, and productivity dimensions and analyzed them using the House of Risk (HOR) method. From the risk assessment in the first phase of HOR, we were able to identify 59 risk events and 73 risk agents. The assessment was followed by an Aggregate Risk Potential (ARP) calculation and analysis using a pareto diagram, which resulted in 16 critical risk agents. From the mitigation action planning in the second phase of HOR, we formulated 28 mitigation action plans that can be implemented in warehouse operations activities to mitigate those critical risk agents. In future research, it is recommended to explore different logistics companies, considering that each company has a different business model and standard operating procedures. We strongly encourage the expansion of the scope of research that covers business processes in the logistics industries in a comprehensive way, not limited to risk in warehouse operations but also an extension of the dimensions and indicators in the process of risk identification in the goods delivery process to customers or last-mile logistics.","designing warehouse operational risk strategy using house of risk and warehouse performance analysis anton leonardi and dendi p. ishak department of industrial engineering faculty of engineering universitas indonesia depok, indonesia anton.leonardi@ui.ac.id, dendi@ui.ac.id",

To analyze the function of HRG, DAVID, the most representative tool was used. The results of GO analysis using the DAVID tool were summarized. The results are satisfactory with a cut-off p value of ≤ 0.04, and it was confirmed that many results were obtained at the cellular level, such as cell signaling, cell differentiation, and cell growth. These results confirmed that many terms related to cancer were found at the cellular level. Pathway analysis was performed using the DAVID tool and mapped to the KEGG pathway database. As with GO analysis, results with p-values of 0.041 or less were summarized. For Pathway, results were similar to those for neuroactive receptor-ligand interactions, systemic lupus erythematosus, and alcoholism. The signaling pathway analyzed above has been reported as a result of research related to breast cancer. Table 2 shows the KEGG pathway analysis of HRG. Table 2. shows the KEGG pathway analysis of HRG. In this study, unlike existing DEG analysis methods that utilize RNA sequence data, we propose a classification method that incorporates machine learning. Existing DEG analysis methods find DEGs through single gene testing. On the other hand, this method considers interactions and variable meanings between features through machine learning and proposes a method to find gene sets based on their combination. Looking at the expression pattern of HRG, like DEG, there is no obvious difference in expression level. In other words, if you look at the HRG genes individually, they do not have much meaning, but if you look at these genes as a combination of gene sets, you can think of them as a set of distinguishing genes.

This automatic flight execution algorithm can be divided into two parts. The first part is to control the mini-drone by composing individual commands using the command protocol and sending these commands to the drone. The second part is to obtain the current position from the control computer control and construct commands to achieve the goal. Petrone made a large error in the process of estimating altitude using the barometric pressure sensor, making it difficult to maintain a stable hovering state. In addition, due to the increase in weight due to the installation of the FPV module, problems such as overload and shortened lifespan of the installed motor occur during operation. Although conducting a full test flight is disadvantageous due to engine failure, autonomous flight of mini drones is possible by classifying each movement of the drone and establishing a system for automatic flight. The automatic flight performed in this study was conducted in an environment where grid lines were drawn on the ground to reduce the difficulty of automatic flight, and the trajectory was moved based on the grid lines on the ground. However, we believe that autonomous flight can be realized by increasing the reliability of hovering with drones equipped with more powerful sensors and expanding it to the general environment by applying an algorithm that detects feature points in the image. In this paper, we looked at the basic theory of drones, mini-drone interpretation and information processing, and performance improvement methods. The automatic flight algorithm applicable to medium to large drones equipped with various sensors and having high flight stability is applied to the mini drone to display commands. Even mini drones can achieve autonomous flight using sensors and visual information.","research on drone autonomous flight se in jung, shin dong ho graduate and professor, my paul school 12-11, dowontongmi-gil, cheongcheon-myeon, goesan-gun chungcheongbuk-do, republic of korea eavatar@hanmail.net jeongwon kim department of economics, college of economics, nihon university 3-2 kanda-misakicho, 1-chome, chiyoda-ku, tokyo, japan shinphys@naver.com",

The quantitative findings of this study highlight the significant impact of operational attributes on PP in the context of PRWs. The analysis confirms a U-shaped relationship between pre-process WT and PP, indicating that each additional minute of WT initially decreases the log of PP by 0.0238 minutes. However, WT squared suggests that as WT increases, the decrease in PP slows down and eventually reverses, leading to an increase in PP. This means that beyond a certain threshold, longer WTs can actually enhance PP, likely due to perceived physician quality and demand. ASD positively influences PP; this indicates that each additional minute of ASD increases the log of PP by 0.02257 minutes, highlighting the value patients place on comprehensive and thorough consultations. The interaction between WT and ASD is complex, indicating that WT*ASD means that for each additional minute of WT, the positive impact of each additional minute of ASD on the log of PP decreases by 0.00207 minutes. However, WT^2 *ASD indicates that as WT increases, the interaction effect with ASD becomes more positive, enhancing PP by 0.00004 for each squared minute of WT multiplied by ASD. This depicts a complex relationship that calls for further study, whether dividing wait time into categories or investigating this relationship according to disease specializations. Overall, the study provides robust quantitative evidence that operational attributes such as WT and ASD are crucial determinants of PP in PRWs. These findings offer valuable insights for healthcare providers aiming to optimize their service delivery to attract and retain patients in the digital healthcare environment. This study has several limitations; it considered a single PRW and country for the analysis, and further studies can consider multiple PRWs and other countries to examine the impact of variables in multiple geographies. Secondly, researchers may consider the interaction effect of hospital vs clinic settings for consultations; it may be possible that clinics are smaller settings with fewer facilities, and the perception of WT and ASD differs from hospitals. Lastly, there are many specialties divided into high-risk vs. low-risk diseases, and researchers can investigate whether the perception of WT and ASD changes as per the nature of the disease.","the impact of operational attributes on patient preferences: an analysis of physician review websites anu rani and saini das vinod gupta school of management, indian institute of technology, kharagpur, india anurani@iitkgp.ac.in, saini@vgsom.iitkgp.ac.in",

In the creation of value, lean supply chains determine the value system through the identification of steps required for value, mapping of the value stream, and creation of rapid sequence steps for value creation. The success of the application of these techniques is reliant on the sincerity of the relationship, which can further lead to the development of conflicts among the stakeholders of interest within the supply chains since most of the relationships are often adversarial rather than collaborative. There are theoretical models and frameworks that relate lean thinking principles with supply chains, and most of them focus on improving the relationship between the involved stakeholders to enhance value and eliminate waste. The present study provided an analytical review of existing literature on lean thinking in supply chain management with a specific focus on technical theoretical models and frameworks based on Industry 4.0 technologies and added to the existing literature on the research topic regarding the efficiency of supply chain management based on lean thinking principles. The research findings show that supply chain flows, technological structure, risk management, and lean manufacturing practices are crucial elements of lean thinking principles in supply chain management. These elements play an important role in various aspects of supply chains within an organization, including logistics, suppliers, collaborative management, strategic decision making, production, and marketing.

139,7Th European Conference On Industrial Engineering And Operations Management  Doi: 10.46254/Eu07.20240261,"this article seeks to establish how lean thinking has become a game-changer in enhancing operational excellence across various industries. lean thinking, which originated in the toyota production system, has evolved into a more general set of concepts for businesses. among the lean manufacturing principles, value, value stream, flow, pull, and continuous improvement remain central to eliminating waste, increasing efficiency, and improving the value delivered to customers. this research focuses on both lean methodologies and lean tools such as value stream mapping, 5s, kaizen, just-in-time, poka-yoke, and kanban. practical examples and real-life cases demonstrate how lean thinking has provided substantial benefits in terms of waste elimination, product quality improvement, productivity rates, customer satisfaction, cost reduction, and employee motivation. however, the application of lean thinking is not without challenges, which may include resistance due to a lack of understanding, cultural barriers, and difficulties in measurement, among others. this analysis addresses these challenges and offers techniques for overcoming them and achieving successful lean transformation. the aim of this analysis is to distill insights from both the conceptual and managerial contexts of lean thinking that may be useful to organizations seeking operational excellence, cost reduction, and sustainable competitive advantage in today's challenging and highly competitive world.","lean thinking, waste reduction","Lean thinking is a great example of how the various ideas and strategies of operative improvement and focusing on customer needs help to build up the environment for success. Its principles and methodologies are portable across organizations and have revolutionized industries by improving efficiency, effecting productivity and innovation, and minimizing cost. There are some obstacles in the implementation of such practices, but if leaders of organizations provide their subordinates with the proper training and encourage them to work on the formation of a new organizational culture, the problems under consideration will be solvable. The incorporation of lean as a digital concept along with sustainability shows that lean is a concept that remains relevant in the contemporary business environment. In an ever-competing and increasing transitional environment, lean thinking gives organizations an upper hand, thus directing them to a confirmed successful way of operating. Due to its focus on continuous change and the implementation of keen customer satisfaction, Lean is optimistic that it will remain a competency strength in management operations in the future.",lean thinking in operational excellence raghunandan gurumurthy crossover solutions usa inc united states raghu.gurumurthy@xosol.com aricson pereira procept biorobotics united states ericpereira87@gmail.com ruchita pereira university of louisiana at lafayette united states ruchirods@gmail.com,"references and a systematic approach that strives to have the right products ready at 
the right time, lean organizations possess thorough means that would enable them to meet and deliver more than 
the expectations of their customers. For example, the introduction of lean in a hospital led to decreased patient 
waiting time and enhanced communication, along with a positive score of patient satisfaction. 
 
Cost Reduction: The continuous outcomes in waste reduction, enhancements in quality, and increases in efficiency 
result in considerable cost savings. All types of waste, particularly those found in the lean system, including stocks 
on hand, wasteful processes, and flawed products, are great costs to the firm (Milewski, 2022). When quality is 
enhanced, it leads to less demand for inspections and rework, which are expensive exercises; therefore, it reduces 
costs. Efficiency increases result in resources being used optimally, leading to lower costs. 
 
Employee Engagement: Lean Thinking also covers aspects of employee involvement, improvement, and 
knowledge sharing. This is well exemplified in the Kaizen business management system, where everyone in the 
business organization is encouraged to provide and participate in improvement initiatives. It not only promotes 
the spirit of the employees' involvement and responsibility in their work but also utilizes their experience and 
ideas, which in turn creates creativity and a high morale among them. A survey of a service organization's 
experience revealed that lean methods boosted employee contentment and organizational performance by over 
50% (Schwantz et al., 2023). Those businesses that adopt lean thinking as their management values can be 
considered to be on the right track towards gaining a competitive advantage in a world economy that is becoming 
progressively more challenging. 
 
5. Implementation Challenges  
It is equally important to note that lean thinking does not come without its challenges. One of the challenges for 
change management is resistance to change, which is usually caused by several factors, some of which are fear of 
the unknown or threats from change processes to already existing practices (Primeast, 2020). This can be 
counteracted through intervention that comprises achieving extensive leadership, communication, and 
accomplishment of change through engaging the employees. Likewise, one should stress the advantages of lean 
and explain doubts that may arise while implementing lean; this generates ownership and increases interest in the 
transformation process. 
 
The other major issue is the general misunderstanding of Lean concepts and practices. The issues and 
recommendations of Lean go beyond the mere use of operational tools and practices and are a complete system 
of management thought. To facilitate the use of lean thinking at the workplace, extensive training and education 
procedures are necessary in order to provide employees with the necessary knowledge and skills. It covers the 
philosophy with regards to particular approaches such as VSM, 5S, the Kaizen methodology, and others, while 
developing a conceptual approach to continuous improvement and elimination of waste. 
 
There are also institutional factors that can hinder lean adoption; these are cultural issues (Zimmermann and 
Bollbach, 2015). This is because certain organizational cultures may not easily embrace the changes that Lean 
brings with it, including the utilization of employees and their collaboration, as well as the constant striving for 
perfection. Of these cultural barriers, it is crucial to address leadership commitment, cultural surveys, and change 
strategies to integrate the organization's culture with Lean. This may include such practices as reducing certain 
hierarchical barriers to communication, rewarding risk-taking, and acknowledging the part played by workers in 
the process of change. 
 
Lastly, the assessment and monitoring of the lean principles' effectiveness are also necessary for implementation. 
The development of relevant and specific Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that are in line with Lean's goals 
allows companies to assess the alterations, reinforce good working practices, and recognize achievements. The 
KPIs can be defined as key performance indicators that encompass lead time reduction, inventory turnover, the 
rate of defects, and the customers' satisfaction ratings (Lara et al., 2023). These are actualizations that should form

VSM, activity profiling, and benchmarking were utilized throughout the evaluation procedure. The current state of value stream mapping gives a snapshot of the situation in the warehouse with all the required processes. It identifies where materials and items are in storage, where overproduction occurs, and how many personnel are engaged in various activities. However, The VSM will not provide a massive data set detailing, for example, how consumers order from warehouses or whether products are frequently requested together. Activity Profiling accomplishes this, which was a crucial consideration when selecting this concept for this study. Both cannot define the warehouse's performance, so benchmarking was used with various KPIs to measure the warehouse's performance based on standards as determined by the gap analysis. The model used in this research combines TPS, kaizen, HRM, and quality management. This model has features that make it highly pertinent to warehouse systems; it is extensive in design, simple to implement in a variety of warehouse types, and useful in the warehouse evaluation process. The aim is to use a model to apply lean in warehouse and use this model as a study resource in workshops conducted to explain the lean concepts to workers. The proposed implemented changes could reduce lead time by 25%, reduce Non-value added time by 33%, and reducing WIP by 30%.","using lean tools in warehouse improvement: a case study from electronics retail sector noha a. mostafa associate professor the british university in egypt, shorouk, cairo, egypt zagazig university, zagazig, sharkia, egypt noha.mostafa@bue.edu.eg youssef essam graduate the british university in egypt shorouk, cairo, egypt",

Through the integration of vegetation into the urban environment, forest cities not only offer an effective ecological solution but also provide significant economic and social benefits. Urban forests can significantly reduce air pollution through the ability of trees and plants to absorb carbon dioxide and other pollutants while releasing oxygen. In addition, vegetation in urban forests can lower urban surface temperatures, reduce the heat island impact, and reduce energy requirements for cooling. Urban forests also provide natural habitats for various species of flora and fauna, increasing biodiversity and maintaining ecosystem balance. The presence of urban forests can increase property values, attract tourists, and create new economic opportunities in the tourism and environmental education sectors, as well as reduce public health costs through improving air quality. Additionally, urban forests offer green spaces that encourage physical activity, recreation, and social interaction, which collectively improve the quality of life for their residents. This research also identifies the importance of balancing the three main pillars of sustainability, namely environmental, economic, and social, which can be achieved through the application of the sustainability triangle theory in the development of forest cities. Analysis of existing urban forestry projects shows that the success of these initiatives relies heavily on the commitment and collaboration of various parties, including government, the private sector, local communities, and research institutions. The policy recommendations suggested in this research, such as increasing community participation, adopting green technology, diversifying plant species, and developing supporting policies, aim to strengthen and optimize the implementation of urban forests in the future. With a strong framework and active participation from various stakeholders, forest cities can be a real and sustainable solution for creating greener, healthier, and more prosperous cities. This research is expected to make a significant contribution to the academic literature and practice of sustainable urban development, providing evidence that the forest city concept is an effective and comprehensive approach to addressing urban environmental challenges.
