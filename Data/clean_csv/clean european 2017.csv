0,Managerial Solution For Hospital-Acquired Infections  Yasaman Parsia,"hospital-acquired infections are not only a major concern for hospitals, but also global health society. life and cost burden of the hospital-acquired infection is very much noticeable. it is widely stated that hospital-acquired infection is not a local issue; it is a challenging global health-related issue. it results a noticeable mortality rate. although many prevention policies and booklets were distributed by different hospital managers for staffs, visitors and patients use, the productivity of the hard-copy booklet method were not encouraging enough. hospital-acquired infection is still a serious problem faced by the ministry of health and hospital policy makers. the main objective of this study is to provide an applicable proposal to encourage mobile application software, active in hospital sites, in order to guide hospital staffs, visitors, and patients on hospital-acquired infections control methods. this study is with the use of qualitative approached in research. a literature review with additional site observations has been conducted by the researchers to achieve the main objective of this research. as the result of this study, we find that mobile health could be an effective method to solve the hospital-acquired infection issue. hospital managers with the support of the ministry of health could provide a free of charge mobile application software in the area of related hospital units for the visitors, staffs, and patients. the software could be planned to show prevention techniques based on each site unit. the users will easily install the application on their smartphone, for free and start reading the prevention methods to enhance their knowledge.",,,"faculty of industrial management universiti malaysia pahang gambang kuantan, 26300, pahang malaysia puteri fadzline muhamad tamyez faculty of industrial management universiti malaysia pahang gambang kuantan, 26300, pahang malaysia shahryar sorooshian faculty of industrial management universiti malaysia pahang gambang kuantan, 26300, pahang malaysia",
1,How Are Supply Chain Optimal Decisions Influenced By  Product Characteristics?,"this study explores how supply chain strategies should be aligned with demand/product characteristics and market requirements. a review of the product-driven supply chain literature suggests that there is a lack of analytically proven guidelines to help strategy makers confidently design their supply chains. in this paper, we provide a mathematical validation for fisher’s (1997) framework which is extensively cited in the literature and matches supply chain strategies (i.e., efficient or responsive) with product type (i.e., functional or innovative). specifically, we analyze the impact of demand variability, product life-cycle, and contribution margin on the supply chain capabilities, i.e., efficiency and responsiveness. our analysis starts with an initial discussion on the two inventory models, newsvendor and continuous review, and then develops the continuous review model into a multi-echelon supply chain structure where optimality is mathematically explored to demonstrate how it would change when product/demand characteristics change. the results confirm that optimal lead-time decreases in demand variability and contribution margin, but increases in product lifecycle. moreover, optimal order size increases in demand variability and contribution margin (and so does in average stock-out cost), but decreases in product lifecycle.",quality management,,"mojtaba mahdavi and tava lennon olsen the university of auckland business school auckland, new zealand m.mahdavi@auckland.ac.nz, t.olsen@auckland.ac.nz",

3,Time Series Forecasting For A Call Centre  Bahar Sennaroglu,"forecasting is an important tool in operations planning. determining resource requirements and scheduling of personnel at a call centre require accurate forecasts. this study includes analysis and forecasting of the number of calls of general type of customers at a private bank’s call centre. these customers are referred to as mass customers and their calls constitute more than 60% of all calls at the call centre. time series data contain double seasonality with intraday pattern for hourly calls within day and interday pattern within week. the data set of hourly calls of ten-week period is separated into a training set consisting of the first eight weeks and test set consisting of the last two weeks. the methods considered include seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (arima) and regression with arima errors. two models out of different candidate models are identified through statistical inferences of the model parameters, diagnostic checking and fit indices by using the training set for the original series and logged series. forecasting performances of the models are evaluated with one-step ahead forecasts by using the test set and it is concluded that suggested models adequately predict hourly calls of the call centre.","call centre, seasonality, arima","It is vital to forecast arrivals accurately at call centres to be able to manage effectively the operations in terms of staffing, scheduling and quality of service. This study includes analysis and forecasting of the number of calls of general type of customers at a private bank’s call centre. The forecasting models obtained using seasonal ARIMA method and regression with ARIMA errors method adequately predict hourly calls of the call centre. Since the time series data of call centres have both a daily cycle and a weekly cycle, the forecasting methods chosen should capture these seasonal patterns. As a further study, artificial neural networks can be used with the same data by adding trigonometric dummy variables for seasonal cycles and the results can be compared with the results of this study.","department of industrial engineering marmara university istanbul, turkey department of engineering and the built environment anglia ruskin university chelmsford essex, uk bsennar@marmara.edu.tr, bahar.sennaroglu@anglia.ac.uk gokcag polat department of engineering management marmara university istanbul, turkey gokcagpolat@gmail.com",

5,Solving The Stochastic Multiple Level Warehouse Layout  Problem Using Simulation Of Ant Colony Optimization,"this research addresses the multiple level warehouse layout problem, which involves assigning items to cells and levels with the objective of minimizing transportation costs. a monthly demand and an inventory requirement are associated with every item type along with vertical and horizontal unit transportation costs. the warehouse has one port to transport items vertically from ground floor to the other levels, where each item must be assigned to exactly one cell on the assigned level. both the items’ demand and their inventory requirements are stochastic, following a uniform distribution. this np-complete problem is solved using an optimization-simulation-optimization approach. in particular, ant colony optimization (aco) algorithm is modeled using discrete event simulation to capture the randomness of the items’ demand and inventory requirements, then the simulated aco’s parameters are also optimized to guarantee superior solutions. this approach’s performance is evaluated by comparing its solutions to the ones obtained using deterministic data. the results show that simulation was able to identify better assignments of items to cells than the deterministic approach, as the latter did not capture the real randomness of demand and inventory requirements.",norfolk,,"algorithm jean-paul arnaout business administration department gulf university for science and technology mishref, kuwait arnaout.j@gust.edu.kw",
6,System Design And Organizational Management  Considerations For A Digital Factory,"in today’s digital era, accelerators such as technology and sustainability have necessitated the transformation of the manufacturing industry, to become adaptive, connected and cognizant of its own functioning. this paper provides a framework for analyzing the system design and organizational management considerations that need to be followed in adopting the digital factory idea with a specific focus on resource efficiency. one of the priorities of this paper is to develop a model to optimize the energy consumption on the production line of a discrete printed circuit board (pcb) manufacturing company in canada. energy efficiency in the manufacturing domain must be seen in a more holistic form, where resource optimizations are supported by information and communication technologies (ict) based infrastructure. this provides means to better understand how energy is being utilized in the factory floor and what could be done to reduce its usage and cost to the company. going beyond energy consumption optimization this paper draws a parallel between the data obtained from the model and the various levels of organizational management, to dynamically adapt the digital factory concept to business plans or goals thereby aiding manufacturing companies in thinking strategically and making informed decisions.","resource efficiency, system design, digital factory",,"pranav ketharam pattabi department of electrical and computer engineering university of toronto toronto, canada pranav.pattabi@mail.utoronto.ca",

The proposal shows the design of the agents as a finite-state machine as a way to give flexibility and adaptive mechanisms to a set of agents. To achieve this the concept of a knowledge base is used. However, the interesting thing about this proposal is that in definition of the interactions among agents and the exchange of information among knowledge bases works as the base base of sociability. As a proposal, a future work section is planned where the implementation of a layer model has the necessary conditions for the construction of the multi-agent system. All these concepts working together will be the base of social-inspired computing. Additionally it is assumed that the basis of this research are the needs of the interconnected systems.

14,Accommodating Solo Women Passengers  When Making Seat Reservation,"most airlines companies’ core objective is to provide a smooth air traveling experience to their passengers. to increase passenger satisfaction, airlines should be aware of passenger seating preferences, including solo women passengers. in the mena countries, particularly in saudi arabia, women are considered to be more conservative than in other countries. due to cultural matters, women do not feel comfortable sitting next to a man passenger. at the time of boarding, when women find that their seat is assigned next to a man seat, they usually request for reseating. most airline seat reservation systems do not meet solo women’s concerns of sitting next to men. the aim of this project is to develop an effective seat reservation system that accommodates solo women passengers’ preferences. it will help the airlines to eliminate seat rearrangement when board on the aircraft. in order to reach an optimal solution, three alternatives were generated and compared using the analytical hierarchy process (ahp). the optimal solution that will be applied in this project is a computerized seat reservation system with an optional choice for sitting in a flexible female zone, with different options for seat types and locations. a check-in procedure will be established and followed by the check-in counter agents, and a boarding strategy will be provided to solve the swapping issues. the expected outcome from this project is to have a satisfactory seating arrangement for solo women passengers. index terms - solo women, seat reservation system, female zone, check-in, boarding, 507",,,"ajwan jan, ayah jamal-allail, noor faidy and nuran tashkandi industrial engineering department king abdulaziz university jeddah, ksa ajwan-jan@hotmail.com, ayah.1994@live.com, noor.faidy@gmail.com, nurantashkandi@gmail.com co-authors: raed obaid & rimal abutaha industrial engineering department king abdulaziz university jeddah, ksa rrmobaid@kau.edu.sa, rabutaha@kau.edu.sa",
15,Evaluating Challenges Faced By Female Undergraduate  Students In Engineering And The Built Environment,"female students in engineering programs are still fewer in number in contrast to male counterparts offering same courses after years of professional integration and learning convergence. currently, in the focal group under exploration, only 28% of students at the faculty of engineering are females, which indicate a wide gap between male and female students within this faculty. the study focus is on identifying challenges which female students experience while studying engineering programs. this is imperative because engineering programs are now less gender selective and it is needful to identify the challenges female students are griping with in order to proffer solutions that will assist the students go through their studies with ease. to identify this problem, a quantitative research approach was taken and data was harnessed from registered female students within the faculty using questionnaires. the results of the study reveals that lack of funding support, inadequate academic mentorship, and peer pressure constitute some of the challenges experienced by female students in engineering faculty. the research outcome is useful as it provides data to guide management in taking informed decision that will address the low intake and number of female student drop out from the engineering faculty.","female students, engineering, study challenges","This study doesn’t sketch a detailed and polished portrait creates of the female engineering learning experience but provides a rough sketch, using a variety of research methods and relying on the female students own words for much of the data. Questionnaires related to the challenges faced by female students in engineering education were distributed to the batch of 2017 academic year. Evaluation has been done utilizing quantitate method in which patterns, themes and categories are examined but focus not on replication. Total of 82 random sampled questions were taken. The questions were based on the information about the age, family background, their learning experiences in a male dominated department, peer pressure and their financial challenges Based on the finidings it is found the maximum numbers of students are between the age group 15-19 only two students were above the age 30. Maximum parents have studied till matric and are employed. It is also found that 40 parents live in rural area and 38 lives in urban area while 5 students gave no answer. Around 53% of the students has obtained loan from National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS). The remaining students have to pay their fees. The lack of funding is a big challenge for the students and this has resulted in some students withdrawing from school. Based on the findings, it is also found, that the female students, faced numerous gender-related challenges and peer pressure, even of the students have no mentor in academic. Although currently Tshwane University of Technology (TUT), has 28% of the female students there is still need for much more females in engineering in order to satisfy ever-growing demand for gender-balanced engineering workforce. Diversity of the student body at academic institutions has immediate economic benefits. In an age where many academic institutions compete for enrolments, in particularly in engineering, not drawing on the pool of women, for example, reduces revenue. Equity, however, does not just mean an equal number of women and men; it means equal chances of success and career opportunities and development. The study, however, attempted to contribute, in its small way, to the knowledge of difficulties of women in engineering education. Women are naturally creative and engineering is creative too, Women bring a much desirable and exceptional zest to engineering and therefore they should be supported, motivated, protected, respected, appreciated, and promoted.","grace mukondeleli kanakana department of industrial engineering tshwane university of technology pretoria, 0001, south africa kanakanamg@tut.ac.za bolanle tolulope abe and purva shrivastava department of electrical engineering tshwane university of technology pretoria, 000, south africa abebt@tut.ac.za; shrivastavap@tut.ac.za","References

19,A Review On Transportation Last-Mile Network Design And  Urban Freight Vehicles,"last mile logistics also referred as city logistics or urban logistics, concerns to the optimization of urban freight transportation systems. this relatively recent concept responds to the need for feasible and sustainable last mile logistics solutions that contribute to reductions on not only costs but on congestion and environmental effects, particularly in dense cities. decisions on a supply level involve network design, which includes urban facilities location. in this context facilities are called urban or city distribution centers, micro distribution centers, satellites platforms or just satellites. on other hand, vehicle fleet related decisions need to be also customized to this particular urban distribution context, specifically dealing with multi-mode selection, fleet size, smaller vehicle capacities (i.e. city-freighters), power technology, vehicle autonomy, and inclusive, vehicle design, etc. literature suggests there is still an opportunity in terms of optimization modeling and methodologies to address these issues. this work revises the drivers motivating the topic, the last mile distribution network elements, and establishes an explicit connection between urban network design and the actual development and use of more environmental and suitable vehicles for urban freight.","last-mile logistics, urban logistics, urban delivery, electric vehicles",,"jessica calderón guerrero industrial and systems engineering universidad de monterrey san pedro garza garcía, n.l, 66238, mexico jesscalderongro@hotmail.com jenny díaz-ramírez division of engineering and technologies, department of engineering universidad de monterrey san pedro garza garcía, n.l, 66238, mexico jenny.diaz@udem.edu","references

20,A Methodology For Integration Of Co2 Emissions On The  Single-Facility Location Problem,"the single-facility location problem (sflp) is one of the most important problems in logistics and supply chain management. its significance is crucial for transportation routes and capacity planning, selection of suppliers, and international expansion of enterprises. concerns regarding the emission of pollutants by transportation vehicles have led to the development of green technologies and sustainable practices. within this context we present a model to dynamically integrate an emission factor of co2 emissions in the sflp. this model is proposed in order to consider the pollutant risk factor within the location decision process. experiments performed on standard flp instances present a difference in the final location of the facility if the co2 factor is considered. this is an important insight to estimate the generation of co2 for this kind of decisions and the pollution risks in specific regions.","co2, green logistics","and Future Work In this work we proposed a methodology and metric to integrate pollutant emissions within the SFLP. The metric uniformly generates emission values within a confidence interval estimated from DEFRA data. Thus, dynamic practical variation of the CO2 emission can be modelled with the proposed metric. Also, the methodology and metric proposed to integrate CO2 emissions on the SFLP showed that there is a difference in the facility location when this factor is considered. Due to these observations, it is important to highlight the pollutant reduction within logistic planning (particularly if Green Logistics is expected to be achieved). Hence, the future work is to be focused on: - to extend on the modelling of CO2 emissions for more distance metrics and surface models; - to analyze the suitability of the model for other distribution contexts; - to implement the CO2 metric on other distribution planning problems (e.g., vehicle routing problems).","santiago omar caballero morales and josé luís martínez flores postgraduate department of logistics and supply chain management universidad popular autónoma del estado de puebla, a.c, upaep 17 sur 711, barrio de santiago, 72410, puebla, méxico santiagoomar.caballero@upaep.mx, joseluis.martinez01@upaep.mx",
21,Historical Hashtags: An Investigation Of The  ‘#Cometlanding’ Tweets,"this study aims to investigate how the twittersphere reacted during the recent historical event of robotic landing on a comet. the news is about philae, a robotic lander from the european space agency (esa), which successfully made the first-ever rendezvous and touchdown of its kind on a comet nucleus on november 12, 2014. in order to understand how twitter is practically used in spreading messages on historical events, we conducted an analysis of one-week of tweet feeds that contain the #cometlanding hashtag. we studied the trends of tweets, the diffusion of the information and the characteristics of the social network created. the results indicated that the use of twitter as a platform enables online communities to engage and spread the historic event through social media network (e.g. tweets, retweets, mentions and replies). in addition, it was found that comprehensible and understandable hashtags could influence users to follow the same tweet stream compared to other laborious hashtags that were difficult to understand on social media.","hashtag, social media, ideas","In this study, we analysed Twitter feeds for the Rosetta Mission Probe landing. Our analysis revealed that most users chose to adopt an uncomplicated and easy official hashtag because it is more understandable and comprehensible. We found that the #CometLanding hashtag received the most hits 801,998 compared to other additional trending hashtags, such as #67P and #Rosetta. It shows that users compliantly tend to follow the hashtag stream and applied the hashtag started by the initiator or domain user. From our observation, user behaviour of tagging is mostly about complying with and adopting this simple hashtag: #CometLanding. Essentially, there was other an additional hashtag used by some people, which is #67P. Even though #67P -the scientific name of the comet- is short and precise compared to other hashtags, but this hashtag did not trend. Based on our insight, this kind of hashtag is more likely perceived as a technical tag because first, the public have no idea of what 67P represents and only those who are familiar and aware of space terms tended to use this hashtag, since it requires a certain level of knowledge and awareness of what it implies. With a simple hashtag, such as #CometLanding, users were quickly settled on the hashtag and we can conclude that it directly attracted people to tweet and engage disseminating information collectively. Secondly, our findings suggest that Twittersphere is a suitable platform for disseminating information for historic events based on the amount of the potential reach tweets calculation during this event. This indicates that microblogging is an important source of covering real-time news updates for an event like this and has a broader network of coverage compared to other social media forms, such as Facebook. Users can easily access the hashtag since any trending topic on Twitter will be displayed on the left side of the client page. They can follow the stream of news updates and post comments to the hashtag without needing to establish a mutual follower/followee relationship with the original posters. This kind of approach spreads the richness of the event and makes the tweets visible for other users who are regularly viewing and gaining updates through hashtags. Besides, several conversations and interactions between two top influencers’ account (@Philae2014 and @ESA_Rosetta) were found appealing to followers, and as a result, attracted many users to retweet and favourited their interactions. It can therefore be assumed that this appealing interaction contributed to the high level of engagement identified during the event. Our analysis also supports suggestions that influencers play an important role as a driving factor to encourage followers to engage. Our analysis showed that users like @Philae2014 and @ESA_Rosetta are the top influencers and that these users are likely the people who were directly, physically and virtually involved in the event. We also found that the frequency of tweets from the influencer (e.g. @Philae2014) was higher when the landing happened with around one tweet per minute (within 10 minutes of the landing) compared to other days within the study period.","noor farizah ibrahim and christopher durugbo school of economics, finance and management university of bristol bristol, united kingdom ni14406@bristol.ac.uk","References

In the system records, difficulties of classification of the stop and inconsistencies were found during the records of the events. It is worth noting that the scenario of the analyzed cell presented many opportunities for improvement in the 5S question, especially in the sense of order and use. There was also absence of wear control, parts being accepted outside the desired specification due to lack of planning of purchases, generating rework, missing parts with a frequency above acceptable, lack of control of the rollers to be recovered and, as a result, the lack of them and the lack of qualification of the employees responsible for both maintenance and assembly.","vinicius de souza moura mechanical engineering department pucrs porto alegre, rio grande do sul, brazil mouravini1988@gmail.com carlos alexandre dos santos dean, school of engineering pucrs porto alegre, rio grande do sul, brazil carlos.santos@pucrs.br daniel luiz de mattos nascimento civil and environmental engineering department puc-rio rio de janeiro, rio de janeiro, brazil danielmn@puc-rio.br rodrigo goyannes gusmão caiado industrial engineering department federal fluminense university niterói, rio de janeiro, brazil rodrigoggcaiado@gmail.com","References

28,Surface Profile Of Objects For 3D Printers By Fringe Pattern  Javier Cruz Salgado,"fringe projection entails projecting a fringe pattern or grating on an object and viewing it from a different direction. it is a convenient technique for contouring objects that are too coarse to be measured with standard interferometry. fringe projection is related to optical triangulation using a single point of light and light sectioning where a single line is projected onto an object and viewed in a different direction to determine the surface contour (case et al. 1987). the fringe patterns are projected on to the object surface and the deformed grating image is captured by a ccd camera for subsequent analysis. phase shifting techniques have been employed to determine the phase value. the phase variation is achieved by using a linear translation stage incorporated to the grating. in this paper, the surface profile of objects for 3d printers is determined by using fringe pattern. biography javier cruz salgado bs, industrial engineering, universidad tecnológica de león, march 2007. ms, manufacturing and industrial engineering, ciatec/conacyt, august 2012. phd manufacturing and industrial engineering 2015, ciatec/conacyt. intern at materials research department ciatec 2011-2012. research stay at illinois institute of technology in the department of applied mathematics 2013. © ieom society international 600",,,"research and technological development department, universidad politécnica del bicentenario (upb), silao, guanajuato 36283, méxico jcruzs@upbicentenario.edu.mx",

30,Synchronizing Discrete Event Simulation Models And  System Dynamics Models,"this paper describes a framework to integrate and synchronize discrete event simulation (des) models and system dynamics (sd) simulation models. sd is used to model the total manufacturing enterprise system while des models are used to provide detailed simulations of the manufacturing processes in the system. the sd and des models are synchronized to reach a comprehensive simulation that accommodate all management levels in a single structure, while recognizing the differences in terms of scope and frequency of decision making, and levels of details suitable at each management level. the current approach can maintain the integrity of the two simulation paradigms and can use existing/legacy simulation models without requiring learning new simulation skills. we discuss certain technical details in synchronizing the two simulation paradigms: the types and format of data exchanged, and the need for replications in des. we propose dividing the des model run into a number of mini runs (segments), and describe the resumption algorithm that is meant to ensure statistical validity of the data obtained from each des segment.",system dynamics,"We have described a framework to synchronize SD and DES models to develop hybrid simulation of the total enterprise system. A comprehensive SD model of the total enterprise system is synchronized with a number of DES models; built to represent selected sub systems. We have discussed the exchange of data between the SD and DES models, and the necessary data preparation and formatting. The SD and DES models run in parallel and their runs are managed by the SDDES controller. It is needed that the DES simulation runs be divided into segments, where each segment is treated as a typical DES simulation run with replications. We presented the resumption algorithm, which monitors the run segments of each DES model and carry data from a segment to the next in order to maintain the statistical integrity of the DES run and outputs, such that autonomous SD and DES model can run in parallel and share statistically valid DES data. Combining SD and DES accommodates the coexistence of the continuous and discrete behaviors and the deterministic and stochastic natures in the manufacturing enterprise system. They also accommodate the different perspectives in decision making and views of the system being focused on the dynamic complexity of the business unit or on the detail complexity in managing it. The comprehensive and scalability dimensions in the simulation models of the manufacturing systems were achieved by using a modular structure that regarded autonomous SD and DES models as modules contributing to the same simulation. This can simplify the model building process as several SD or DES models can be built with well defined, relatively narrow scopes to model the various business units and then be interfaced. The addition and deletion of the DES models as the system evolves over time is not restricted. Further, we can utilize existing simulation models without the need to learn new simulation skills. It is acknowledged that more experimentation is necessary to emphasize the value of the proposed approach. In particular more investigations of the resumption algorism are needed to evaluate its effectiveness for more complex DES model configurations.","magdy helal industrial engineering department american university of the middle east, kuwait magdy.helal@aum.edu.kw luis rabelo industrial engineering and management systems department university of central florida, orlando, fl, usa, 32816 luis.rabelo@ucf.edu",
31,Quality Control In A University Laboratory: Evaluating The  Gap Between Iso/Iec-17025 Requirements And The Thin,"the benefits that the implementation of quality management systems bring to testing and calibration laboratories make a compelling case for their deployment in teaching and research laboratories. the thin section laboratory, based at a south african university is a research and teaching laboratory currently facing funding and quality challenges and has to find ways of supplementing the grant it receives from the university. one of the ways is providing commercial testing services. testing and calibration laboratories are required to conform to iso/iec 17025:2005 which is the general requirements standard for competence of calibration and testing laboratories. the thin section laboratory compliance to this standard can improve the quality of its services to compete with other testing laboratories. using laboratory experiments, surveys and interviews, this study aimed to evaluate the gap between the thin section laboratory processes and iso/iec 17025:2005 requirements, assess the iso/iec 17025 implementation challenges for such laboratories and evaluate the possible benefits of implementing such a system. the study found the gap between iso/iec 17025:2005 requirements and laboratory procedures to be wide but recommended solutions to narrow it. the findings of this study can be utilised by other teaching and research laboratories with intentions of implementing iso/iec 17025.","quality, quality assurance, quality control",,"section laboratory’s processes. bongumusa mansuette bhekamalinda cebekhulu school of mining engineering wits university johannesburg, rsa musa.ceb@gmail.comn chipo mugova management college of southern africa (mancosa) johannesburg, rsa mugovac@gmail.com","References

32,An Investigation Into The Causes Of Continuous Resistance To  The Implementation Of A Centralised Hr Support Services,"this paper explores the dynamic process of change and change management. while change is about moving to a future state, change management is the process of supporting individual employees impacted by the change through their own transitions. the study aimed to investigate the causes of continuous resistance to change towards the implementation of a centralized hr support services from business units of a multinational mining house, company x with operations in southern africa. the study used both quantitative and qualitative research methods using survey questionnaires and semi structured interviews for data collection to explore different experiences of key employees and management of the mining company and industry as a whole. this study found that poor communication, poor leadership, and poor change management result in resistance to change. some key recommendations put forward for company x leadership are to produce a change management framework specific for each business unit concerned, including feedback sessions, and the need to have a communication plan about the need for change and its benefits to be used to persuade employees to accept the change programme. this research contributes significantly to thought leadership on the issues of change and change management in the south african mining industry.","change, business units, change management","This research has provided valuable insight on the importance of organisations being ready for change in order to implement change successfully. The findings suggest that change planning processes and systems were not adequately in place or implemented which led to discontent amongst employees at company X. Popular theory states that employees as well as the structure of the organisation must be ready for change. Majority of the respondents felt that more rigorous change planning and deeper stakeholder engagement could have prevented some of the challenges experienced at Company X. The current socio economic climate is increasingly unstable for company X. From reform in the global mining sector to issues of social risk in the South African labour market, the company should take this opportunity to learn, reflect and improve ways of working through localised solutions and meaningful engagement with staff teams. The conclusions of this research have been summarised around the objectives of the study below. 5.1 The Perception of Management and Employees towards Effective Change Management There was a wrong perception and misunderstanding of the change that was identified as being prevalent at both BUs. The difference in perception of management and employees towards effective change brought about lack of alignment, wrong perception of the change to be implemented, resulting in a low sense of urgency for employees at Company X. A disconnect between managers and employees’ perception is present in that management is of the view that the change was warranted based on thorough analysis of their BUs in SA. Management stance was that blue chip companies had to follow predominant industry practices that have success records once implemented. Management is able to see the positive changes that new the HR model brings, such as better policies, cost reductions, better control systems; better employee engagement, and cost reductions. Although workers attest to the HR model being efficient, they have negative perceptions on its implementation process. 5.2 Root Causes and Barriers to Change within the BUs Parochial self-interest, possibility of jobs becoming obsolete, fear of job losses, and a preference to continue with previous ways of working so as not to lose control were identified as some causes and barriers to change within the BUs. Lack of effective leadership in change management was instrumental in the resistance to change; there was disconnect with the views of top management and those of the employees at the operational level that have to work with the new HR model. The lack of efficient change agent was also identified as a possible cause to the continuous resistance to change as there was not sufficient interactions and engagement with the affected employees. Critical decisions about change were made without much of their input nor consultation. Employees at Company X shared the desire to have experienced a more personal and transparent leadership style. Lack of employee involvement in the decision making processes can lead to employees not assuming ownership, lack of commitment, manifesting in work stoppage, high turnover, or absenteeism. The findings show that a lack of trust amongst employees and management and this hampered relationship building during the change implementation process. 5.3 Contribution of Culture to Resistance to Change","within a global mining house. stella zoë mulombe management college of southern africa (mancosa) johannesburg, south africa stellazoet@yahoo.com chipo mugova management college of southern africa (mancosa) johannesburg, south africa mugovac@gmail.com","References

The questions sought to find out the impact of online tools, M-commerce and E- commerce on visibility and availability and it was generally noted that there has been such an impact. Translators are having more customers outside of the country, working beyond normal hours to meet deadlines for other time zones, and generally doing business without necessarily having face-to-face contacts with their clients. It was found that translators are mobile professionals with locational mobility, with the ability to create work spaces anywhere and using their mobile phones as an extension of their offices. Thus the impact of using these tools has been an increase in visibility and availability. 5. Conclusion and Recommendations 5.1 Conclusions The following were the main findings of the research and the linkage with the literature review: • Translators in South Africa are accustomed to using technology to enhance their work productivity. Tools such as printers and flash disks have already become obsolete in this industry, which relies strongly on online tools such as email and online portals to deliver jobs to clients. • CAT tools are becoming increasingly prevalent in use in South Africa, although crowdsourcing which is commonly used overseas is not used as much in South Africa. • Translators use email as their main form of communication with clients, to the extent that they have not met personally with their clients. Translators are already communicating with overseas clients and it can thus be surmised that they are equally penetrating the overseas market as well as bringing business to South Africa. 647","industry in south africa carla selyer language specialist johannesburg, south africa translation.pro1@gmail.com chipo mugova management college of southern africa (mancosa) johannesburg, south africa mugovac@gmail.com","References

Economical incentives enticed and later governmental legislations compelled companies to initiate product recovery programs. European waste legislation currently gives a global framework for the implementation of extended producer responsibility in Europe. Inventory and production planning focuses on the effective utilization of existing inventories and production resources, therefore managing inventory in reverse logistics represents an important problem. The focus of this paper is on the mathematical modeling of inventory with return flows that were developed on the base EOQ. The general objective of the inventory management models is to control product orders, inventory levels, and recovery processes to minimize total costs. Our modeling approach generalizes a whole class of various models that draw attention to different aspects of production, inventory, and recovery. A complete solution in the form of a theorem for that general model class is provided. Furthermore, the paper illustrates how that theorem can be applied to one of the mentioned models from the literature, Jaber and Saadany, 2009. In their paper the authors provide solution procedure in the form of algorithm and did not provide the complete explicit solution to this complex problem. We provide the solution in this paper. We found the optimal policy P(m; n) for the problem, it can have a different structure depending on the value of the parameters. The impact of the switching cost becomes apparent for sufficiently high values. In this case the optimal numbers (m, n) can both be greater than one. This was illustrated by the numerical analysis. The consideration of the government regulations related to extend producer responsibility instruments such as minimum recovery target and disposal fee is the future direction of this research. A legislative environment will be considered, where the government requires the producers to collect and recover at least a certain percentage of their sales and imposes a disposal fee on each product not recovered up to this quota Acknowledgements The work is supported by Saint Petersburg State University grant 15.61.208.2015","with lost sales nadezhda kozlovskaya and knut richter saint petersburg state university, universitetskaya nab 7/9, 199034, st. petersburg, russia n.kozlovskaya@spbu.ru, k.rihter@spbu.ru",

36,Effect Of Supply Chain Performance Measures On Supply  Chain Profitability: An Empirical Investigation Using,"the purpose of the research is to investigate relationship between two major constructs (supply chain performance measures and supply chain profitability) as supply chain has a key role to play in the expansion and profitability of retailers and it also provides a recognized foundation for retail industry success, the most significant challenge that impedes by r-scm is the development of an efficient and modern retail sector is an underdeveloped supply chain, thus this research provides a model using rigorous empirical method to validate the instrument scale for measuring the validity and reliability of the identified constructs. additionally the paper further tests the relationship between supply chain performance measures and supply chain profitability using structural equation modelling (sem). the data was compiled and collected from 213 operations and supply chain heads from leading retail stores in india. confirmatory factor analysis (cfa) was used to test the validity of the proposed measurement scale and the relationship is tested using structural equation modelling (sem). the results exhibit that all the scpm items have significant loadings to their corresponding second-order construct, similarly all the scp items have significant loadings to their corresponding first-order construct. the relationship between the second order construct scpm and scp was also found to be significant. the results of the structural equation model analysis supports the developed hypothesis, which states that, higher level of scm performance leads to higher level of sc profitability. it was found that standardized coefficient was statistically significant at (p < 0.01). the hypothesis is accepted which states that organizations implementing scm have obtained improved performance, cost savings, increased revenues, and the reduction of defects in products are some of the chief advantages of introducing supply chain management. it has been demonstrated that business profitability is closely associated with performance measures. overall, the model has a satisfactory fit with cmin/df 2.648, rmr 0.078, rmsea 0.088, gfi 0.813, nfi 0.810 and cfi 0.872. from the results it can be mentioned that the selected measures provide a good guide to managerial decision making processes. another significant contribution of the research lies in the fact that there are a plethora of studies identifying different dimensions of sc performance; however, there is no study identifying important dimensions for managers. this study identifies important sc performance measures beneficial to managers, which deserve their immediate attention. the research contributes a model to the knowledge of theories on supply chain management by suggesting to obsolete old performance measures to eradicated © ieom society international 668",,,"structural equation modelling in indian retail sector prof.

39,Exploring The Secondary Co-Operative Model In The Supply  Of Fabric To Primary Sewing Co-Operatives,this paper presents the role of a secondary co-operative in the supply of an input key to delivering a product by a co-operative movement focused on manufacturing. this study bases its focus on sewing co-operatives and uses the supply of fabric as an example that relates to a proposed secondary co-operative that would be established within a township community of south africa to supply fabric to clothing manufacturing co- operatives. a literature grid specifying references and concepts used to arrive at the suggested model is also presented on the paper. secondary co-operatives in supply chain management are key to inter-cooperation of manufacturing co-operatives and to sourcing quality inputs at reasonable rates. in conclusion it is specified that empirical studies could be done to improve and develop further the suggested model of supply chain management through a secondary co-operative structure. policy makers in the areas of re- industrialization through co-operatives especially in emerging countries may consider secondary supply co- operatives to be drivers of inter co-operative cooperation and as providers of strategic operational support to the manufacturing co-operative movement particularly in clothing manufacturing which is a sector confronted with cheap clothing imports from low cost producing countries.,supply chain,"This paper reminds the academic community in the fields of engineering of the role that collaboration can play in building productive capacity in small and medium manufacturing enterprises. The literature used on this paper is recent but also shows that there is a growing interest in supporting social enterprises making products for their communities and done by the same community members. Although private sector still creates the most economic opportunities and other trade initiatives, it is worth noting that the resilience of co-operatives is rather better than that of investor owned firms which commonly resort to retrenchment and restructuring during unfavorable economic times, unlike manufacturing co-operatives where worker-members are able to renegotiate their own salaries and share schemes to save both the co-operative, employment and retain buyers. The global challenges which humanity faces today also requires enterprises which are more humanistic in their approach to wealth creation, consumption of natural resources and ensuring equitable participation of most people in the economy, and this can be achieved through co- operatives. Private companies had been able for centuries to run the clothing manufacturing sector. However, the working conditions in the clothing manufacturing factories are devastating especially in Asia. These conditions include the payment of low salaries, working long hours, child labour and unsafe working conditions, this kind of a problem could be solved if skilled individuals organised themselves into worker co-operatives for production purposes but also secondary co-operatives to solicit training, education and also create market access. A secondary co-operative role is such that the primary co-operatives and their members will put in resources which can be shared by the members of the secondary co-operative to advance their communities and protect their own people from any potential exploitation associated with production in the textile sector, also a secondary co-operative can assist its member co- operatives to handle economic challenges associated with the continental problems indicated on section 4. The key recommendations are described on the following section. 5.1 Key Recommendations It is recommended that technical researchers in the field of operations management reserve time to conduct research on manufacturing social enterprises as part of their community engagement. Although this might not be seen as a profitable exercise, it will benefit ordinary people. It is also recommended for African scholars of engineering to invest time in studying supply chains of co-operative enterprises as these are enterprises bringing development to rural communities and providing inputs for established private industries. In summary this research recommends the following: • Government intervention to co-operative development should not interfere with the independence of production co-operatives and the co-operative movement at large. • Education for co-operative movements should be designed to address the need for cooperation amongst co- operatives. • The governance of secondary co-operatives should embrace transparency and focus on creating market access, create a resource pool for primary co-operatives which are members and invest in training its members on production efficiency, quality and distribution. The last part of this paper gives an idea and direction which future research should take in the area of advancing the co-operative movement through cooperation. 5.2 Focus of future research This study was limited only to focusing on sewing co-operatives and this study was selective of clothing co-operatives and literature reviewed. Therefore, an empirical study which would extend, develop further and test the suggested model is recommended as well as the testing of the pilot project plan for the development of a secondary co-operative.

40,Quality Control In The Clothing Production Process Of An  Under-Resourced Sewing Co-Operative: Case Study,"the availability and ease of access to substitute quality products and services has created an expectation among consumers in different markets to expect as certain standard of quality on any purchase they make. this expectation leaves some small manufacturing enterprises out of the market if they are unable to cope with the dynamic quality requirements of consumers. this paper uses a case study of a clothing manufacturing co-operative which has been operational for 48 years and which with resource constraints had managed to satisfy customers beyond expectation based on available customer feedback. this study shares a lesson which may be not generalizable in other contexts, which is that small manufacturing co- operatives should strive to focus their quality control efforts on the key quality control points mentioned on this paper. this research paper also suggests that more research be done on small manufacturing enterprises regarding total quality management which is a knowledge area largely dominated by research on well- established enterprises. in principle this paper also calls for an increase in research which can benefit the operations management field about the knowledge of small manufacturing social enterprises which are common and beneficial for communities in developing countries.","quality, co-operative, manufacturing, control","of this paper with the component of key recommendations and direction for future research. 5. Conclusion In conclusion the key quality control points are not the only reasons for the success of a small manufacturing co- operative such as the one referred to in this study. It should be noted that there are other contributing factors to operational excellence and performance in terms of quality in the operations of a small clothing manufacturer focused on sewing, these factors include tacit knowledge, flexibility of the sewing process, repeat orders and the small quantity of orders processed. 5.1 Key recommendations A recommendation which can be made from this non-generalizable case study is that each under-resourced enterprise should study its production processes to improve them either by accumulating new resources or using the limited available resources. This paper also recognizes that it may be costly for some subsistence co-operatives to keep up with latest quality management trends but it is possible to maintain a skill of quality management which guides the system operators about common areas of focus in the process of managing and controlling quality. 5.2 Focus of future research This research paper has a limitation of a single case study and a future study could also focus on evaluation of quality practices in sewing co-operatives. A quality practice such as Total Quality Management could be a viable study area as most small manufacturers have not kept up with TQM and understanding the underlying reasons and also filling the gaps in the knowledge area of quality management in small manufacturing enterprises is relevant in our life-time where all opportunities and all size businesses form part of bigger economies. Acknowledgements This paper was made possible through the information provided by the co-operative referred to on this case-study research paper. The co-operative also allowed the researchers to gain access to records regarding quality management.","mkwanazi michael sizwe department of quality and operations management university of johannesburg auckland park, 2006, south africa msmkwanazi@uj.ac.za / sizwel4@gmail.com mbohwa charles faculty of engineering and built environment university of johannesburg auckland park, 2006, south africa cmbohwa@uj.ac.za","References

54,Surface Profile Of Objects For 3D Printers By Fringe Pattern  Javier Cruz Salgado,"fringe projection entails projecting a fringe pattern or grating on an object and viewing it from a different direction. it is a convenient technique for contouring objects that are too coarse to be measured with standard interferometry. fringe projection is related to optical triangulation using a single point of light and light sectioning where a single line is projected onto an object and viewed in a different direction to determine the surface contour (case et al. 1987). the fringe patterns are projected on to the object surface and the deformed grating image is captured by a ccd camera for subsequent analysis. phase shifting techniques have been employed to determine the phase value. the phase variation is achieved by using a linear translation stage incorporated to the grating. in this paper, the surface profile of objects for 3d printers is determined by using fringe pattern. biography javier cruz salgado bs, industrial engineering, universidad tecnológica de león, march 2007. ms, manufacturing and industrial engineering, ciatec/conacyt, august 2012. phd manufacturing and industrial engineering 2015, ciatec/conacyt. intern at materials research department ciatec 2011-2012. research stay at illinois institute of technology in the department of applied mathematics 2013. © ieom society international 791",,,"research and technological development department, universidad politécnica del bicentenario (upb), silao, guanajuato 36283, méxico jcruzs@upbicentenario.edu.mx",
55,Queing Theory For Banking Application  Ravi Nasit,queue length optimisation and service efficiency is an integral part for banks. queuing theory helps in understanding the waiting lengths and times to correlate it with performance and customer satisfaction. the queuing models are worthwhile in evaluating the service efficiency of a counter. the research revolves around understanding the single server model to assess a counter in bank and calculate the utilisation parameters to analyse the efficiency of the counter. queueing model is applied in order to check the frequency of the counter being busy and evaluate the service rate. the queuing theory is highly advantageous and can help optimise the queue lengths in the bank. the scrutiny of the bank queues through the single server models will assist in finding the flaws in the service and devising ways to improve the service rates in order to minimise the queues and have an efficient utilisation rate. the objective behind the experimentation is to optimise the queue lengths and revamp the working of the counter and enhance the service efficiency.,"gandhinagar, gujarat-382007",,"student, department of industrial engineering, school of technology, pandit deendayal petroleum university, gandhinagar, gujarat- 382007, india nasitravi40@gmail.com, ravi.nie13@sot.pdpu.ac.in",

57,Analyzing Issues Affecting Food Security In South African Rural Areas: Case Study  Of Limpopo Province,": during the last decade, south africa has been dealing with a serious food crisis. the reason of this food crisis has been largely attributed to the effect of climate changes, land availability and high food prices, which in return have caused an important damage to the lifestyle of many households, especially those living in rural area. in response to this backdrop, the south african governments decided to develop new strategies in order to create a future environment where households are not dealing with issues relating to food insecurity. one of the strategy put in place has been on empowering small farmers by giving them the necessary resources. because, they believed that small farmers would contribute in reducing food crisis by increasing food throughput, as it this later is viewed as a serious challenge for many countries all over the world. however, this approach has not yet meet the expected result due to the fact that the trend of food crisis still growing at regional and national level. therefore, the present research article aims at developing a model that can help to enhance food security in south africa. the model focus on four keys such as food availability, poverty per district, intra-household food distribution, land availability. limpopo province was used as case study. the result show that the mitigation of food insecurity can increase employment and empower those who live in townships.","food security, poverty, agriculture, climate changes",,"ms noko mokoele, mr. yves mulongo faculty of economics and financial science university of johannesburg, po box 524, auckland park 2006, south africa mmokoele@yahoo.com, yvesmulongo4@gmail.com",

59,"Service Procedure Of Tgtdcl, Is It Compatible With The  Modern World?-A Case Study Of Tgtdcl","titas gas transmission and distribution company limited (tgtdcl) is a public limited company (government share 75%) responsible for distributing natural gas to customers at the household, commercial and industrial level. in order to deliver it services more efficiently, the company needs to address a number of customer services issues such as service processes, customer experiences, communication processes and gas marketing rules. titas gas personnel use traditional procedure to deliver services to their customer. as a consequence, customer needs to run to get services. tgtdcl still may be considered as a low level service provider. the understanding of the innovative service process, and its economic implications, these studies do some key questions what needs to be changed? are some processes and models no longer applicable for tgtdcl? does tgtdcl need to develop new explanations and model regarding its services? this paper has reviewed available literature regarding current service procedure and compared with traditional model of titas gas. it outlines strategies for improving management procedure. finally, this paper introduces a case study that shows how customer of tgtdcl can get efficient and innovative services and thereby make the customer service of tgtdcl more efficient. key words: service innovation, employee motivation, strategic management, customer service. 1 introduction and theory background traditionally services are described as elements which cannot be touched, intangible and cannot be viewed as object. a service is viewed as an activity or process and no transfer of ownership takes place. besides, the demand of service has increased due to globalization, advancement of the it application, knowledge production, community building and networking (as hanneke. vos 2010). the important things are knowledge on people, management and strategy, and technological domain need to be combined and integrated to design a proper solution to the customer (candi m 2007). there are at least two complicating factors of services such as multidisciplinary and high degree of heterogeneity. bartos (2002) sets out a definition of innovation appropriate to the public sector: innovation is a change in policy or management practice that would lead to a lasting improvement in level of service or quantity or quality of output by an organization. in addition, innovation processes in the public sector may vary between different countries due to institutional variations (gallouj & zanfei, 2013). besides, the results of a recent literature review by de vries et al. (2016) suggest that most existing studies of public sector innovation have been conducted in liberal market economies such as the usa and the uk, implying that more research from other countries is needed. research has not yet been focused much in public service innovation (a few examples include windrum and koch 2008, hartley 2005, soren and torfing 2009, gallouj et. al. 2013, borins 2001, fuglsang et. al. 2014).the most of service innovation research has used private profitable firms as their empirical setting (a.s. tor helge et.al. 2016). literature discussing innovation in the public sector is increasing; the amount of research literature innovation in the public sector is still limited. specifically, there is almost not any research literature regarding service systems of national oil & gas sector of the least developed country like bangladesh. according to finland research agency, tekes (tekes), “service innovation is a new or significantly improved service concept that is taken into practice. it can be for example a new customer interaction channel, a distribution system or a technological concept or a combination of them. a service innovation always includes replicable elements that can be identified and systematically reproduced in other cases or environments. the replicable element can be the service outcome or the service process as such or a part of them”. 18",,"and Further Study Smooth cooperation is vital for the revenue, sales and Material Engineering and Control Department for executing effective customer services. Third Party/stakeholders relations (enlisted contractor, Local political leaders, City Corporations and police administration) and coordination regarding Titas gas services is very poor. Political leader’s commitment and police-city corporation smooth communication with TGTDCL, and accountability can play a vital role in improving management and customer service procedure of TGTDCL. Change of management and financial procedure regarding service systems at TGTDCL needs to emphasize. This study shows that TGTDCL should reduce the bureaucratic barrier, delegate financial empowerment and improve professional conduct within the departmental jurisdiction. Integrated computer systems of TGTDCL need to enhance to execute efficient customer services. This study shows that TGTDCL has lack of motivated people due importance of customer services relevant to the staff selection and transfer right places of work force. This paper demonstrates that administrative innovation to develop service systems is not given due importance at the TGTDCL. The reasons for not emphasizing service innovation with structural and service process need further study.

60,Exploring Challenges Impeding Sustainable Supply Chain  Practices In Mining Sector,"growing pressures from various players such as governments, non-governmental organizations, and customers have impelled business corporations to address the economic, environmental, and social issues associated with their supply chain activities. consequently, the concept of sustainability has become a buzzword among scholars and industry practitioners. although, the concept of sustainability is attaining high level of importance in europe, america, and asia due to its ability of ensuring environmental sustainability, in africa the integration and application of sustainability’s concept is facing several challenges. to date, several studies were conducted to investigate the barriers affecting sustainability practices in mining sector at country’s level. however, an investigative study regarding the barriers of sustainability practices in mining sector of the southern african development community (sadc), which involve fifteen african countries is missing, this paper aims at filling this gap. the data were collected through a quantitative approach. at least 1 423 participants were involved in the survey. the findings revealed that the major barriers blocking the development of sustainable supply chain in mining industry of sadc region include lack of commitment on environmental deterioration, lack of communication and knowledge sharing, ineffective monitoring and control system, lack of effective policy and legislation direction, high cost associated with the implementation of sscm, poor supplier commitment, lack of green practitioners, poor senior managements’ commitment, lack of recycling activities. lack of political commitment and support, lack of managerial support and practical tools, and inadequate individual capacity.","mining industry, challenges, sustainability",,"ndala yves mulongo and pule kholopane department of quality and operations management faculty of engineering and the built environment university of johannesburg, po box, 524, auckland park, 2006, south africa yvesmulongo4@gmail.com ; pulek@uj.ac.za",
61,The Role Of Participant Governed Networks In Implementing Healthcare  Innovations Into Practice. Evidence From The Uk Nhs,"due to the increasing level of underfunding and the aging population, the united kingdom national health service (nhs) is under pressure to find innovative ways to improving patient care and service quality. different research has emerged that suggest the importance of ‘evidence into practice’ within healthcare networks, as one of the means of promoting efficient and effective healthcare. however, a review of extant literature reveals that limited research has examined the value of participant-governed networks on the implementation of new evidence into practice within the uk nhs. this study therefore draws on the theories of the network and network governance to present an empirical evidence of how participant- governed networks influence the implementation of new evidence into practice. the study is one component of a large-scale, collaborative, longitudinal project examining the value of the west of england academic health science network (weahsn). underpinned by a multiple case study methodology, semi-structured interviews and document analysis were used to obtain data from five maternity units, the weahsn’s team members, industry partners’ and general practices across the weahsn’s region. while the first case dealt with the use of magnesium sulphate to decrease the incidence of cerebral palsy in preterm labour, the second case examined the optimisation of anticoagulation use in the reduction of atrial fibrillation related stroke. preliminary results revealed that informal communication, flexible implementation strategy and incentives are the key factors that influenced the implementation of new evidence into practice in complex healthcare networks such as the uk nhs.","networks, governance, english nhs. 833",,"udonna okeke; wendy phillips university of the west of england, bristol united kingdom",
62,Degree Of Cluster Linkages And Innovation Performance Of  A Firm: A Study Of Bengaluru High-Tech Manufacturing,"- it is primarily understood that clusters are the sources of innovation and therefore, of late, the focus of researchers and practitioners has been increasingly to ascertain the factors driving innovation among the firms in a cluster, especially in a high-tech cluster. researchers have identified that the dynamism of a firm in terms of degree of interactions of a firm with other firms and related institutions as one of the key drivers of innovations in a firm residing in a cluster. however, this has not been empirically validated considering the gamut of interactions of a firm with all the stakeholders within and outside a cluster. it is in the context of bengaluru (erstwhile bangalore) cluster which houses densely interconnected network of high-tech manufacturing firms this paper probes the influence of degree of cluster linkages on the firm-level innovation. key words: cluster linkages, innovation, high-tech industries, industrial cluster, bengaluru 1. introduction innovation is considered as one of the key drivers of productivity and firm performance (schumpeter, 1934; porter, 1990). in the context of a developing country, mytelka (2000) defined innovation as the process by which firms master and implement the design and production of goods and services that are new to them regardless of whether they are new to their competitors, their customers or the world. further, from the perspective of a manufacturing firm, the focus is laid on technological innovation which provides the firm a competitive edge over others (becheikh et al., 2006). however, firms in general, and small and medium enterprises (smes) in particular are constrained by internal resources that serve as impediments to undertake innovations by them. it is here the notion of industrial cluster which comes in handy to eliminate or lower these impediments and thereby propelling innovations in firms (ketels, 2003). clusters offer various benefits to firms as well as regions housing these clusters (muskell, 2001, ketels, 2003; sonderegger, 2010). notably, they facilitate firms to achieve higher levels of innovation and productivity (porter, 1990; ketels, 2003). however, firms in a cluster can derive economic benefits from positive location specific externalities resulted out of network effects only if the firms in a cluster interact adequately. hence, it is appropriate to understand the influence of interactions of firms in terms of cluster linkages on the innovation levels of firms. furthermore, among the clusters of the globe, bengaluru cluster occupies a unique position as it includes not only it sector but also multitude of high-tech manufacturing industries (e.g. electronics, pharmaceutical, machine tools, © ieom society international 834",,,cluster deepak c department of management studies indian institute of science india deepakc@mgmt.iisc.ernet.in m h bala subrahmanya department of management studies indian institute of science india bala@mgmt.iisc.ernet.in,

Findings indicate that the furniture manufacturing SMMEs play a pivotal role in the economy. Some of these SMMEs even exports their products (furniture) to the SADEC region. However, these furniture manufacturing SMMEs do not invest heavily in ensuring quality in their products and services. Moreover, furniture manufacturing SMMEs should understand that failing to ensure quality is not only costly but the enterprise can lose customers due to them switching suppliers. Should furniture manufacturing SMMEs ensure quality, their cash flow will be favorable. They must also work on strengthening their relationships with all of their stakeholders as this has a positive impact on the quality of the products and service.","smmes, south africa lawrance seseni department of quality and operations university of johannesburg johannesburg, auckland park 2006, south africa sesenilawrance@icloud.com charles mbohwa department of quality and operations university of johannesburg johannesburg, auckland park 2006, south africa cmbohwa@uj.ac.za",
64,Factors Influencing Effectiveness Of Lean Maintenance  Repair And Overhaul In Aviation,"in order to improve efficiencies and minimise costs, maintenance, repair and overhaul (mro) services in the aviation sector are increasingly embracing lean philosophy and advances in technology. the central tenet of lean philosophy is to eliminate non-value adding activities from value streams. while the take-up of lean philosophy is increasing, there are indications that aviation mro services are facing challenges in implementing lean and this inevitably impacts on the effectiveness of such continuous improvement programmes. this paper presents findings from a study on aspects of lean philosophy in aviation mro organisations. the focus of the study is on critical success factors that can impact the effectiveness of continuous improvement and lean waste reduction programmes in aviation mro organisations. findings from the study showed that emphasis needs to be placed on technical, non-technical and managerial considerations when implementing lean in aviation mro organisations. in addition, also observed is a shift of emphasis in critical success factors when operating cloud-based aviation mro systems in comparison to traditional aviation mro systems.","maintenance, aviation, lean","and Future Work Effective lean waste reduction with the benefits of increased resource utilisation and productivity is achievable in aviation MRO services. Technological advances such as cloud-based systems should in principle help leverage the gains of lean in MRO services. There is however important critical success factors to be aware of when implementing lean in MRO organisations. This paper presented an analysis of the critical factors using results obtained from a focus group. Based on the analysis and discussion of the results it is concluded that there are differences in the significance of some of the critical success factors for effectiveness of lean implementations in traditional aviation MRO organisations compared to a cloud-based aviation MRO organisations. Monitoring and evaluation of performance, technical competence, consultant participation, user appreciation, and supplier management are emphasised more for lean implementation effectiveness in cloud-based MRO organisations. Project management, organisational infrastructure, and education and training are also important critical success factors for lean implementation in both traditional and cloud-based aviation MRO organisations. Management, non- technological, and technical groups considerations are found to be significant when considering the implementation effectives of lean in MRO services. The emphasis placed on how these groupings will affect the effectiveness of lean implementation differs in traditional and cloud-based MRO settings. More emphasis is on the technological factor grouping for lean implementation in the cloud-based MRO services.

71,Barriers And Enablers Of Lean Tools In Medical Laboratory  Industry: A Case Of Namibia,"turnaround time covers activities involving ordering, collection, transportation, preparation, analysis, interpretation, and provision of medical test results to clinicians and patients. considered as the most important key performance indicator in the medical laboratory industry, turnaround time is influenced by various forms of lean wastes, which are, transportation, inventory, motion, waiting, over production, over processing, and defects. elimination of these wastes will improve the operational efficiency and cost- effectiveness of the medical laboratory industry. given the widespread awareness of what lean can do in the healthcare industry, it worthwhile investigating the factors behind the adoption of non-adoption of lean in the medical laboratory industry. this paper investigates the barriers to and enablers of lean adoption and implementation in the context of medical laboratories in namibia. findings from this research indicate that management support plays an important role in enabling lean adoption. on the other hand, lack of support from management is the strongest inhibiting barrier to the successful adoption of lean.","barriers, enablers, turnaround time, medical laboratory, lean tools","obtained above, that top management involvement is the most crucial factor in lean implementation. Following the lack of management support, financial constraints and staff resistance to change have a significant influence. However, lack of conceptual knowledge and absence of lean culture in the laboratory have moderate influence on inhibiting the implementation of lean in the medical laboratory industry. These findings are similar to what was observed in past studies by Drotz (2014); Mallick et al. (2012). 4.3 Managerial Implications This research provides important managerial implications. Deriving from this study, the following approaches are considered to essential for lean transformation and application, particularly from the context of the Namibian medical laboratory industry: 1. Identify the key performance indicators which are below the target, along with the existing wastes; 2. Implement improvement initiatives based on the affected indicators and communicated to the relevant personnel; 3. All staff involved should be trained adequately; 4. Identify the most appropiate lean tools and apply them according in order to eliminate wastes; 5. If little or no improvement, revise and restart the process repeatedly until the wastes are eliminated; 6. If wastes are eliminated, monitor the process often to ensure that the wastes do not reappear; and, 7. Sustain the process and strive for perfection by continually removing the wastes as they appear. The suggested strategies are slightly in agreement with Poksinska (2010) and Venugopal (2013). Poksinska (2010) argued that there is no single approach to adoption of lean. However, this study provided an insight into lean implementation, through which the medical laboratory industry can strive to improve turnaround by eliminating waste or non-value adding steps in their processes. 5. Conclusions This study investigated the enablers and barriers of lean in the medical laboratories, with a case study of the Namibian medical laboratory industry. Findings from the study indicated that management support plays a crucial role in the successful adoption of lean tools. On the other hand, lack of support from management is a cause for concern as it poses the strongest inhibition to the successful adoption of lean.","michael mutingi faculty of engineering, namibia university of science and technology, windhoek, namibia faculty of engineering and the built environment, university of johannesburg, johannesburg, south africa mmutingi@nust.na hilma d. isack, faculty of engineering, namibia university of science and technology, windhoek, namibia hileni kandjeke faculty of engineering, namibia university of science and technology, windhoek, namibia charles mbohwa faculty of engineering and the built environment, university of johannesburg, johannesburg, south africa cmbohwa@uj.ac.za","References

For all the tests conducted, p values are greater than 0.05 (p>0.05). The result shows that the students’ performance does not represent the connection between the program of study and the course content. This could be due to the students’ educational background prior to registering for the program or lack of interest as earlier mentioned. It may also imply in the first year of study that students are not yet conscious of the fact that workloads in the higher institution are more challenging as compared to high school workload and methods of study need to be tactically and properly planned. According to (Hari et al., 2016, Simpson and Fernandez, 2014), the lower mean value is better than higher mean value. Consequently, comparing the mean scores obtained in hypothesis (i) and (iv), both mainstream and foundation students’ performances are better in 2013 compare to 2014. The low performance in 2014 could be associated with the increased workload that the students had to undergo. For hypothesis (ii), (iii) and (v), the mean scores reveal that the mainstream students performed better than the foundation students. The low performance of the foundation students could be associated to the entering admission point scores. In addition, the students’ academic background prior to admission could pay a crucial role in their performances. Furthermore, the results show in general that the continuous assessment evaluation method is not adequate for improving the students’ performance since the students’ performance did not increase as shown in our findings. Further evaluation work will be conducted to establish these findings.

75,Exploring The Influence Of Flexibility On Readiness To Deploy  Manufacturing Process Innovation,"it is important to attain an appropriate state of deployment readiness when implementing process innovation. that is, ensuring that deployment will run smoothly and relatively problem free. essentially, deployment readiness is a feature of pre-implementation phase and it represents the state of preparedness for something about to happen. of increasing interest in the literature is finding ways of achieving the highest degree of process innovation deployment readiness. whilst methods of assessing deployment readiness are emerging, the influence of flexibility on deployment readiness is yet to be ascertained. this paper focuses on the influence of flexibility on readiness to deploy process innovation in manufacturing. in particular, the emphasis is on how flexibility mediates deployment plans for implementing manufacturing process innovation. deployment plan is conceptualised as the approach, scope, and execution planned for the deployment of an innovation initiative. the interrelationships of flexibility and deployment plans is studied using simulation of a job shop with routing flexibility and results show that deployment plan is significant to innovation deployment readiness performance and its significance is moderated by flexibility.","manufacturing, process innovation","and Future Work Getting prepared for deployment is an important step when implementing manufacturing process innovation. The level of preparedness, captured through measures of deployment readiness index, is a useful indicator for managing implementation of process innovation. There are several factors than can influence deployment readiness and they include the deployment plan and manufacturing flexibility. This paper focused on these two factors and found that flexibility can influence deployment readiness. In addition, flexibility is found to mediate the impact of deployment plan quality on deployment readiness. These results were obtained based on computer simulation of a job shop and for a specific routing rule FCFS. Areas of future work should look more closely at the role of manufacturing flexibility more generally such as flexibilities other than routine flexibility, the criticality of machines and jobs, the effect of alternative rules of routing jobs to the alternative machine's queue and other range of performance measures beyond service level performance. Work is also required in validating and extending the findings to other types and manufacturing processes and environments.","alireza javahernia, funlade sunmola and leslie mitchell school of engineering and technology university of hertfordshire hatfield, al10 9ab, uk a.javahernia@herts.ac.uk, f.sunmola@herts.ac.uk, l.mitchell@herts.ac.uk",

78,Evaluating Challenges Faced By Female Undergraduate  Students In Engineering And The Built Environment,"female students in engineering programs are still fewer in number in contrast to male counterparts offering same courses after years of professional integration and learning convergence. currently, in the focal group under exploration, only 28% of students at the faculty of engineering are females, which indicate a wide gap between male and female students within this faculty. the study focus is on identifying challenges which female students experience while studying engineering programs. this is imperative because engineering programs are now less gender selective and it is needful to identify the challenges female students are griping with in order to proffer solutions that will assist the students go through their studies with ease. to identify this problem, a quantitative research approach was taken and data was harnessed from registered female students within the faculty using questionnaires. the results of the study reveals that lack of funding support, inadequate academic mentorship, and peer pressure constitute some of the challenges experienced by female students in engineering faculty. the research outcome is useful as it provides data to guide management in taking informed decision that will address the low intake and number of female student drop out from the engineering faculty.","female students, engineering, study challenges","This study doesn’t sketch a detailed and polished portrait creates of the female engineering learning experience but provides a rough sketch, using a variety of research methods and relying on the female students own words for much of the data. Questionnaires related to the challenges faced by female students in engineering education were distributed to the batch of 2017 academic year. Evaluation has been done utilizing quantitate method in which patterns, themes and categories are examined but focus not on replication. Total of 82 random sampled questions were taken. The questions were based on the information about the age, family background, their learning experiences in a male dominated department, peer pressure and their financial challenges Based on the finidings it is found the maximum numbers of students are between the age group 15-19 only two students were above the age 30. Maximum parents have studied till matric and are employed. It is also found that 40 parents live in rural area and 38 lives in urban area while 5 students gave no answer. Around 53% of the students has obtained loan from National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS). The remaining students have to pay their fees. The lack of funding is a big challenge for the students and this has resulted in some students withdrawing from school. Based on the findings, it is also found, that the female students, faced numerous gender-related challenges and peer pressure, even of the students have no mentor in academic. Although currently Tshwane University of Technology (TUT), has 28% of the female students there is still need for much more females in engineering in order to satisfy ever-growing demand for gender-balanced engineering workforce. Diversity of the student body at academic institutions has immediate economic benefits. In an age where many academic institutions compete for enrolments, in particularly in engineering, not drawing on the pool of women, for example, reduces revenue. Equity, however, does not just mean an equal number of women and men; it means equal chances of success and career opportunities and development. The study, however, attempted to contribute, in its small way, to the knowledge of difficulties of women in engineering education. Women are naturally creative and engineering is creative too, Women bring a much desirable and exceptional zest to engineering and therefore they should be supported, motivated, protected, respected, appreciated, and promoted. 945","grace mukondeleli kanakana department of industrial engineering tshwane university of technology pretoria, 0001, south africa kanakanamg@tut.ac.za bolanle tolulope abe and purva shrivastava department of electrical engineering tshwane university of technology pretoria, 000, south africa abebt@tut.ac.za; shrivastavap@tut.ac.za","References

80,Effective Performance Analysis Of Industrial Robotics For  Automated Manufacturing System,"this paper is completed on a study for industrial robotics work unit, in which, continue to grow in the manufacturing world and across industry. while those are efficiently very useful, industrial robots require an initial capital investment, and take training to be able to operate for setting up the optimal performance in terms of capacity providing rate of the cycle time. with a controlled working environment, industrial robots can repeat tasks time after time providing the effective cycle times with an ignorable difference unless the conditions being uncontrollable. in this research work, a set of empirical experimentation is done using a 2k full factorial doe, with 2 factors affecting 2 responses. the factors are the type and speed of robotic programing termination, while the responses are cycle time and consistency as variables for the effective performance. the analysis shows that the factor fine (termination type) at 100% (speed) yielded the best results for cycle time and cnt (termination type) at 100% (speed) yielded the best consistency of the robotics program.","industrial robots, manufacturing, 2k factorial, factors, responses","and Recommendation Through testing the different parameters offered while programming industrial robots, there can be a few conclusions made about the different effects the parameters will have regarding cycle time and consistency. If industrial engineers are most worried about cycle time, then they should have the settings up at FINE for termination type, and the speed should be set at 100% of maximum speed. While if the engineers are most worried about consistency of the path the robot will be following, they should use the CNT0 setting for termination type, and the speed should be set at 100% of maximum speed. This was what was found to be the best in the experimentation with this particular equipment of; FANUC LR-Mate 200 iB, industrial robots. However, with different robotic programs it may have different results. As previously stated, the interaction of termination type and speed had no statistical significance when using cycle time as a response, but the interaction did indeed have statistical significance when using consistency as a response. Each factor individually did play a statistically significant effect on the results for both responses. This is incredibly useful moving forward with other experiments, because now it is clear that researchers do not need to worry about how the combination of the factors and how they might interact 1 -1 21.5 21.0 20.5 20.0 19.5 19.0 1 -1 A Mean of Consitency B Main Effects Plot for Consitency Fitted Means 1 -1 24 23 22 21 20 19 18 17 16 15 1 -1 A Mean of Cycle Time B Main Effects Plot for Cycle Time Fitted Means",,"References

81,A Lean Transportation Approach For Reducing Distribution  Cost: A Case Study,"this work describes the strategy of a mexican firm to improve its transportation cost of unused truck capacity. this is based on the application of a transportation waste elimination scheme for increasing efficiency in its warehousing and routing operations on a detailed level. the operational equipment effectiveness index used in tpm is adapted to be used as the main performance measure. availability, performance and quality wastes are identified using value stream mapping of the distribution operations. the implementation of the improvement initiatives is still in progress but pilot test and projected results are provided.","lean routing, value stream map","and results This work provides a brief description of the application of the efficiency improvement approach to the distribution operations of one of the leading steel Mexican conglomerates. The company is experiencing an important level of transportation cost originated by an important level of unused truck capacity (CUTC). Thus, the management of the company developed a strategy for reducing this cost concept by identifying and eliminating waste in its logistics operations. The two most important wastes found correspond to a Fill Loss and waiting for loading and loading time in excess. Fill loss has an important impact on CUTC through the quantity or volume component of the concept. The waiting for loading and loading time in excess affects CUTC by determining the extra charge of the freight rate for the delivery. The improvement strategy developed is still in process. Figure 6 describes the behavior of CUTC before and after implementing the strategy. The current level of CUTC is 14 Mexican pesos per ton, 75% lower than the average from Jan – Jun, 2015. It is expected that this level will be at 8 Mexican pesos per ton after full implementation of the strategy.

Emergence of LCC has intensified the environment of competition. Both the FSC are affected by the emergence of LCC. Competition dynamics of FSC with each other as well as with LCC may change with the passage of time depends upon action and reaction of airlines. Overall it is observed that customer focused business policies lost to cost focused business policies in terms of market shares. Results reveal that there exists a competition between LCC and FSC but only up-to a certain level; because LCC has set its own market and low costs have encouraged new passengers to travel. Results also show that AAR responded earlier to the emergence of LCC than KAL. LV model can be applied to furnish an efficient forecast. There are a couple of limitations to the study, first the LV analysis is applied for Jeju Island travelers and overall trend of South Korean Airline Industry may be different or even different type of relationships may exist on different routes. Secondly, there may be several external factors which are not considered in this model.

83,Prediction Of Residential Sector Energy Consumption:  Artificial Neural Network Application,"in order to analyze the way residential sector energy is consumed putting into consideration certain factors, this study predicted the united states residential sector energy consumption from 1984 to 2010. the factors having impact on the way energy is consumed were assessed using the connection weight approach while the energy is being predicted. artificial neural network was successfully applied in the prediction with a correlation coefficient of 0.97903. it was observed that the median household income was the most important factor in the consumption of residential sector energy consumption with a percentage of 93% followed by household size and cost of residential natural gas with 90% and 56.5% respectively while resident population was the least important factor followed by cost of residential heating oil, gross domestic product and cost of electricity in percentages of -76%, -51%, -30.5%, and 18% respectively.","connection weight, analyze","This study as compared to the study of (Kiralashaki and Reisel, 2013), used all the available inputs to predict accurately the amount of residential sector energy consumed in the United States. (Kiralashaki and Reisel, 2013) selected the inputs separately for three different ANN models, the first model considered GDP and cost of residential electricity, the second model considered GDP, median household income and cost of residential electricity while the third considered GDP, median household income, cost of residential electricity and cost of residential heating oil. From this present study, it can be said that all factors were able to predict the residential energy consumption successfully, however, the most important factors are the median household income followed by the household size, next to the cost of residential natural gas. From this present study carried out it can be said that the income received by household says a lot in the amount of energy consumed which was recognized in two models of the previous studies, however, household size as well as cost of residential natural gas were not selected as inputs in either of the three models. Based on the household income, it determines the type of household gadgets the family could afford as well as the energy efficient gadgets. The amount of individuals residing in a home based on their behavioral pattern will also affect how energy is being consumed, either efficiently or inefficiently. The United States residential sector case study gives a clearer view of how these factors do contribute to the energy consumed between 1984 and 2010. It is very important that the three key contributing factors identified in this study be attended to in ways that could assist in the conservation of energy consumed in the residential sectors.","o.a olanrewaju quality and operations department, faculty of engineering and the built environment university of johannesburg, south africa dlp4all@yahoo.co.uk c. mbohwa quality and operations department, faculty of engineering and the built environment university of johannesburg, south africa cmbohwa@uj.ac.za",
84,Assessment Of Residential Sector Energy Consumption: Data  Envelopment Analys,"the objective of this study is in the assessment of residential sectors use of energy through a benchmarking methodology taking the years of consumption as the decision unit. it further assesses the effect of each of the independent variables responsible for each year’s residential energy consumption known as sensitivity analysis. to achieve the following objectives, data envelopment analysis (dea) was employed. the study considered the united states residential sector data from 1984 to 2010, with residential population, gross domestic product, household size, median household income, cost of residential electricity, cost of residential natural gas and cost of residential heating oil as inputs while the energy consumed was the output. the study found out that the year 1996 proved the most efficient while gross domestic product proved important in the way energy needs to be consumed efficiently.","assessment, benchmarking, residential sector","Benchmarking is very important to see how improvement could be implemented on areas where there is lack of attaining the objective set for a particular goal. This study considered data envelopment analysis in the best way to benchmark how residential sectors energy could be consumed. The United States data from 1984 to 2010 was used a s the case study. Apart from the way energy could be efficiently used, sensitivity analysis was also conducted by omitting one of the inputs in separate combinations of the remaining inputs. From the result of the operational efficiencies, year 1996 proved very efficient as DMUs 1990, 1991, 1994, 1997 and 2001 would have being very efficient in the consumption of energy if only the way of operations in 1996 was emulated. Policies governing the year 1996 would also be advised to have been practiced in those years especially in the years 1997 and 2001 after experiencing the way 1996 performed. It has also been realized that the cost of residential electricity consumption should not be the focus when the remaining inputs are considered as without the cost of electricity, ways to minimize the energy consumed in the residential sector could be achieved. Gross domestic product on the other hand has proved to be important factor when considering the way our residential sector energy is consumed. It is assumed that the increase in a country’s energy consumption there will be growth in the country’s economy in essence the economy would increase. The misconception in this ideology is that if a lot of energy is consumed inefficiently it will also have a setback on the growth of the economy. The economy can only gain advantage if the way energy consumed is done efficiently.","is (dea) application o.a olanrewaju quality and operations department, faculty of engineering and the built environment university of johannesburg, south africa dlp4all@yahoo.co.uk c. mbohwa quality and operations department, faculty of engineering and the built environment university of johannesburg, south africa cmbohwa@uj.ac.za",
85,"Quantitative Impacts Of Independent Research And  Development, Foreign And Domestic Technology Transfer","energy continues to play a significant role in human lives. among the indicators that have a major part to play in the consumption of energy is intensity factor. considering the influence of intensity on energy consumption; its reduction will go a long way in promoting the sustenance of energy supply both locally and internationally. many activities have been investigated upon that can assist in its reduction. these activities include research and development (r&d), introduction of foreign technology and domestic technology transfer driven activities. this study aims to evaluate these activities with the focus on minimizing energy consumption. a designed integrated model (artificial neural network and data envelopment analysis) that can be used in this regard is established. with south africa as a case study, the model identified much concentration on foreign technology transfer as a means of energy reduction.","integrated model, r&d","This paper introduces technology transfers and R&D activities as factors which are critical in deciding the optimal use of energy. These activities are quantified to show their level of importance on energy consumption reduction so that their significance can be taken seriously among the energy community. In order to have a clearer picture how these activities contribute to energy reduction, a designed model, integrating both artificial neural network and data envelopment analysis was established. In this regard, the artificial neural network was used to investigate and establish the baseline of the energy consumption based on the impacts of the various activities. Data envelopment analysis conducted a sensitivity analysis on the various inputs omitted one after the other. The result of the data envelopment analysis was validated with the connection weight approach of the artificial neural network. The South African case study gives a wider margin of how these activities contribute to energy reduction. It is very important that the country starts to concentrate on indigenous technologies and R&D activities so as to reduce the margin between them and the concentration on foreign technology transfer.","on energy consumption o.a olanrewaju quality and operations department, faculty of engineering and the built environment university of johannesburg, south africa dlp4all@yahoo.co.uk c. mbohwa quality and operations department, faculty of engineering and the built environment university of johannesburg, south africa cmbohwa@uj.ac.za","References.

87,A Study On The Cycle Time Of An Assembly Workstation  Using Application Of Arena Simulation Software In A,"cycle time variation is a metric and philosophy for continuous improvement with the aim of driving down the deviations in the time it takes to produce successive units on a production line. it supports organizations' application of lean manufacturing or lean production by eliminating wasteful expenditure of resources.. although it is often used as an indicator of lean progress, its use promotes a structured approach to reducing disruption that impacts efficiency, quality, and value. arena simulation on the other hand arena is a discrete event simulation and automation software that allow user to builds an experiment model by placing modules (boxes of different shapes) that represent processes or logic. connector lines are used to join these modules together and to specify the flow of entities. while modules have specific actions relative to entities, flow, and timing, the precise representation of each module and entity relative to real-life objects is subject to the modeller. this study was conducted in the assembly workstation of a headboard, the upper part of every bed with a unique design. this study was done in the ax furniture, muar, johor darul takzim using interview, observation on the production department and arena simulation. observations were made by studying each element of motion film recorded by video recorder. the research was done in order to identify the cycle time of the headboard assembly process and to increase the efficiency of the cycle time of the headboard assembly itself. results from this study may help to increase the efficiency of the cycle time concept in a furniture industry.","cycle time, arena simulation, assembly, headboard","and Recommendation 5.1 Recommendations For the recommendation, the study suggest to add workers on the places where the cycle time of the process is much longer than other. Now, some might argue that the addition of the workers may increase the cost of production, but in this case the study is to create a much efficient cycle time in order to keep up with the manufacturing demand.

Specifications will be outlined on maintenance procedures of machine parts, quality assurance and control on the peeled products as well recommendations on user safety when operating the machine. 4.1 Quality Control For quality control, the following quality checks may be conducted: • Size • Color • Appearance Size: The carrot should weigh at most 12% less than its initial mass. The high peeling accuracy is achieved by the use of the variable frequency drive (VFD) motor controlled peeling blades. The user can conduct the size test by weighing the initial mass of a carrot before peeling and the mass after peeling. The peeling loss can then be calculated as 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚−𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛 𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 × 100%. Color: Color of the peeled product is also another important quality control tool. The initial color of the carrot should not be distorted. Appearance: The outer surface appearance of a peeled carrot gives an indication of the peeled carrot quality. The carrot should not be bruised after the peeling process and the peeled surface should be uniform. Safety: The machine operator should be kept safe from any form of danger that may harm or injure them by following the instructions on operation of the machinery. Rotating and moving parts have been housed and guarded as expected from modern day design to prevent contact with the user during operation. The machine has been designed to start the conveyor belt once a carrot has been placed on it through the use of a proximity sensor that communicates with the conveyor belt electric motor through the Mitsubishi GX Developer PLC. Once no carrot is being sensed to be on the conveyor, the belt electric motor automatically shuts down. In this regard the operator should not place their hands on the belt as this will start the belt and might lead to finger or hand injuries. Special attention should also be taken on good hygienic practices since the product being processed is consumed by human beings. The receiving buckets should always be kept clean all the time and should be washed by a disinfectant on a daily basis to ensure high standards of hygiene. The machine parts that the carrots get into contact with should also be regularly cleaned to avoid contamination. These parts include the conveyor belt, transport rollers and peeling blades. A provision is there to allow easy access of these parts when the need for cleaning arises. Maintenance: To fall back on the money invested in buying the machine and to get the most out of the peeling action there is need for maintenance and servicing regularly. Preventive maintenance should be done on electric motor","department of mechanical engineering university of johannesburg p.o box apk 524 johannesburg south africa tawandanda.mushiri@gmail.com, tawandamushiri123@hotmail.com dennis m. mupatsi department of mechanical engineering university of zimbabwe p.o box mp167 mt pleasant harare zimbabwe mupatsimd@gmail.com charles mbohwa faculty of engineering and the built environment university of johannesburg p.o box apk 524 johannesburg south africa cmbohwa@uj.ac.za","References

95,Evaluation Of Optimisation Methods On The Shop Floor Of A  Serial Production,"there are a lot of different tools and methods available to optimise shop floor processes. these methods include for example poka yoke, 5s, lean management, kanban and total quality management. it is a challenge for many companies to transfer these methods efficiently to their production. besides the difficulty of choosing the right method, the estimation of the effectiveness of these methods remains uncertain. currently most employees are not acquainted with the methods mentioned above. what is more, they cannot assess the process efficiency regarding the implementation of these methods. even experts of optimisation methods are only able to assess the efficiency according to experience. to date, a scientific analysis of a shop floor in series production via a business simulation and the selected optimisation methods does not exist. the following hypothesis is given: “the effectiveness of selected process optimisation methods can be demonstrated via a developed model in form of a business simulation in a model factory” to confirm the hypothesis, a model with a business simulation that helps to assess the usage of the optimisation methods on the shop floor was developed. although this method is scientifically recognised, experiments like this have not yet been undertaken for production processes. therefore, the purpose of this scientific study is to close the research gap with a systematic analysis of series production with a simulation and the generated data using design of experiments (doe). to achieve this, the deployment of the optimisation tools on the shop floor is measured and evaluated. as kpis, lead times of the individual workstations, total lead time, reworking, and inventory costs are measured. the selection of the methods used in this game is based on the prevalence in literature, group discussions and a quantitative survey. methods used are kanban, standard worksheet, 5s and poka yoke.",,,"patrick pötters1/2,a,, robert schmitt1,b bert leyendecker2,c 1rwth aachen university, laboratory for machine tools and production engineering, steinbachstraße 19, 52074 aachen, germany 2university of applied sciences koblenz, faculty operations management, konrad-zuse-str. 1, 56075 koblenz, germany apoetters@hs-koblenz.de, br.schmitt@wzl.rwth-aachen.de cleyendecker@hs-koblenz.de",

100,Techno Economic Assessment For Setting Up A Viable Biogas  Plant At A Local Landfill In South Africa,"the potential to economically run a biogas plant for the generation of fuel for use by the local buses was investigated. various organic waste with varying total solids (ts) and organic loading were investigated for bio methane generated under mesophilic conditions. the first plant had a capacity of 10 tons per day and ts loading of 11% and 15%. assuming 20 years of operation, after investing r 10 848 338, a breakeven point of 9.9 years with an internal rate of return of 8.3% was achieved for ts loading of 15% with 85% base. whereas, when a 50 tons per day plant was investigated for a ts loading of 11% and 15%, a breakeven point of 6.4 years was achieved with an internal rate of return of 14.3% at an organic base of 85%. from the assessment, it is economical to set up a 50 tons per day plant and the biogas produced has potential to power more than 10 local buses. this can be further increased if the organic loading in the bio digester is increased to 25% ts content.","biogas, organic waste","The waste quantification conducted indicated that all organic wastes discharged at a local landfill are available for energy recovery as they are presently being covered with top soil to degenerate. If all organic wastes are converted into bio methane, about 100 Metro buses can be fuelled. The 20% is a conservative estimate of the theoretically calculated 157, representing 29%, metro buses that can be fuelled. There is a low likelihood for return on investment for a 10 ton/day plant and high potential for return on investment for a 50 ton/day plant especially when co-digested with grass residues. A 50 ton/day which holds higher return on investment with a shorter payback period is highly recommended for investment.","m. m. manyuchi bioenergy and environment technology research group faculty of engineering and the built environment university of johannesburg, south africa mmanyuchi@uj.ac.za c. mbohwa bioenergy and environment technology research group faculty of engineering and the built environment university of johannesburg, south africa cmbohwa@uj.ac.za e. muzenda bioenergy and environment technology research group faculty of engineering and the built environment university of johannesburg, south africa emuzenda@uj.ac.za s. masebinu bioenergy and environment technology research group faculty of engineering and the built environment university of johannesburg, south africa somasebinu@uj.ac.za",

102,An Engineering Approach To Increase Chances Of Data  Capture-Ability And Data Analyzability In Work,"the work measurement standard of a given work is determined from the standard operating procedure of the work at hand, as well as from a work study program that captures the time taken to carry out all related activities. the activities must be both ‘capture-able’ and ‘analyzable’ in order to set the standard time, where specific values are assigned to defined time elements. conventional assembly production works are routine, repeatable, have discrete cycle times, and have predictable patterns of execution as per the operating specifications. for this type of work, time studies (also known as ‘pre-determined time methods’) are able to capture and analyze time elements efficiently. however, factory works have become increasingly sophisticated and non-conventional. many portions of the work now possess opposite characteristics of the aforementioned, to the extent that conventional work measurement techniques are no longer efficient in the development of the appropriate work measurement standards. in this paper, case studies are used to describe six characteristic attributes of time elements and the pertinent mapping of work measurement techniques in a ‘data capture-able versus data analyzable’ quadrant, which can be used in the development of work measurement standards of non-conventional factory works. the purpose of the paper is to provide an insight of the capture-ability and analyzability of work data. this may prove useful in future workforce models, which are becoming more integrated in terms of ‘digital and human’ patterns rather than the routine human-only operations.","non-routine work, time study",,"measurement practices thong sze yee manufacturing engineering universiti malaysia perlis (unimap) kangar, perlis, malaysia g1240510789@studentmail.unimap.edu.my or szeyee.thong@flextronics.com zuraidah bt. mohd zain manufacturing engineering universiti malaysia perlis (unimap) kangar, perlis, malaysia zuraidah@unimap.edu.my tan chan sin manufacturing engineering universiti malaysia perlis (unimap) kangar, perlis, malaysia cstan@unimap.edu.my","References

103,2017 International Conference On Industrial Engineering And Operations Management (Ieom)  Using Bpm To Improve Sustainability In Biomass Generation,"biomass represents approximately 10% of the energy sources in the world. the most common use of biomass for energy is direct combustion, gasification, carbonization and pyrolysis. in this perspective, torrefaction emerges as a thermal biomass pre-treatment method that has an ability to reduce the major limitations of biomass, such as heterogeneity and lower energy density. however, one of the outputs from the torrefaction process is a pyrolysis condensate (tar). tar is brown or black liquid composed of hydrocarbons which can cause clogging and fouling of pipes, heat exchangers or particulate filters. this paper provides a study performed in a biomass power generation company that was producing an excess of tar. in order to provide a solution to the excess tar generated, a framework to implement sustainability business processes using the business process management (bpm) approach was used. the study found two solutions for the issue (short- term and long-term scenarios) using tools to improve the process management by focusing on sustainability.","sustainability, renewable energy, torrefaction, 203",,"bruno gallotta centre for supply chain improvement university of derby derby, uk, de22 1gb b.gallotta@derby.ac.uk vidrene kolelas chemical engineer vidrene.kolelas@gmail.com jose arturo garza-reyes centre for supply chain improvement university of derby derby, uk, de22 1gb j.reyes@derby.ac.uk anthony anosike centre for supply chain improvement university of derby derby, uk, de22 1gb a.anosike@derby.ac.uk vikas kumar bristol business school university of the west of england bristol, uk, bs16 1qy vikas.kumar@uwe.ac.uk",
104,Location And Emergency Inventory Pre-Positioning For  Disaster Response Operations: Min-Max Robust Model And,"pre-positioning emergency inventory in selected facilities is commonly adopted to prepare for potential disaster threat. in this paper, we simultaneously optimize the decisions of facility location, emergency inventory pre-positioning, and relief delivery operations within a single-commodity disaster relief network. a min-max robust model is proposed to capture the uncertainties in both the left- and right- hand-side parameters in the constraints. the former corresponds to the proportions of the pre-positioned inventories usable after a disaster attack, while the latter represents the demands of the inventories and the road capacities in the disaster-affected areas. we study how to solve the robust model efficiently and analyze a special case that minimizes the humanitarian cost. the application of the model is illustrated by a case study of the 2010 earthquake attack at yushu county in qinghai province of pr china. the advantage of the min-max robust model is demonstrated through comparison with the deterministic model and the two-stage stochastic model for the same problem. experiment variants also show that the robust model outperforms the other two approaches for instances with significantly larger scales.","disaster relief, facility location, network flow",,"a case study of yushu earthquake wenjun ni department of industrial and manufacturing systems engineering, faculty of engineering, the university of hong kong hong kong niwenjun@connect.hku.hk jia shu department of management science and engineering, school of economics and management, southeast university nanjing, jiangsu, china jshu@seu.edu.cn miao song department of logistics and maritime studies, faculty of business, the hong kong polytechnic university hong kong miao.song@polyu.edu.hk",

106,Dynamic Asset Allocation Using Elastic Asset Allocation  Taewan Kim,"when markowitz proclaimed in his research paper, there were many crises in economic system. the majority of economist and quant had suggested their own model of portfolio and theories. our research suggested a new portfolio which is named ‘t&m’ using elastic asset allocation, diversified investment, and real momentum. using kelly criterion, t&m portfolio’s efficiency and stability were verified. market indexes used in t&m portfolio are us 10 year t-note futures, us 30 year t-bond futures, s&p 500, canadian s&p 500,s&p/tsx composite, dax, hang seng, kospi, usd/krw(forex), and gold future. the data was used from jan 1st, 1988 to sep 1st, 2016. the period verified was computed from 1989, monthly. microsoft excel 2013’s inner function was used as a main analysis program. finally, t&m portfolio increased by about 15.503%(cagr), and mdd decreased by about 6.3%. with this, this study verified he high stability and efficiency of elastic asset allocation. both of two students got the data for completion of study. taewan kim had conducted for comparing, sorting data, back-test, writing about elastic asset allocation and kelly criterion, and mihyeop lee had conducted for writing the stock market, momentum, standard deviation, theory of portfolio, introduction and conclusion.",,"The newly developed T&M portfolio using volatility, correlation coefficient, and momentum strategy is a portfolio that focuses on profitability while minimizing the proportion of cash. The core of the T&M portfolio proposed in this study rebalances at the beginning of each month. Rebalancing is to balance the portion of highly valued assets with those of undervalued assets and takes into account the profits and losses of the group of assets that generated the losses. The rebalancing has been incorporated into the T&M portfolio. The T&M portfolio uses the low correlation coefficient, monthly rebalancing, and momentum. The data includes the Hang Seng(HSI), Nifty 50(NSEI), DAX(GDAXI), S&P500(SPX), S&P/TSX Composite (GSPTSE), US 10 Year T- Note Futures, US 30 Year T-Bond Futures, and KOPSI(KS11). Market indexes used in T&M portfolio are US 10 Year T-Note Futures, US 30 Year T-Bond Futures, S&P 500, Canadian S&P 500, S&P/TSX Composite, DAX, Hang Seng, KOSPI, USD/KRW(Forex) and Gold Future. The data from Jan 1, 1998 to Sep 1, 2016 was used for the research. According to the results, T&M Portfolio rebalances ratio at every single month. Using the momentum score, it was calculated through comparison of non-risk cash asset(CAGR 3%) to get a proper ratio, and T&M Portfolio showed less loss and stable profit. For example, simple momentum portfolio had got a lot of loss during 2008 financial depression, but T&M Portfolio recovered the loss by bond and gold asset. When T&M Portfolio set the ratio of cash asset high, both CAGR and MDD got a loss. When another way set the ratio of cash asset low, CAGR and MDD got higher. Also, multiplying the leverage can get more profits at a short term, but MDD got higher to increase of volatility. The conclusion drawn from this study is the ratio of multiplying leverage and cash asset which must increase at the same time. Up to now we have tested the profit depending on ωM, ωC, and ωV. In conclusion: the research framework and research methods were as follows: (1) when ωM increases, both CAGR and MDD increase. (2) when ωV increases, both CAGR and MDD decrease.

108,Loosely Coupled Microservice Architecture For Internet Of  Things,"microservice architecture can be futher extended to cover the internet of things. prior to microservice architecture, service oriented architecture (soa) has been used for designing and orchestrating services but with limitation of scaling. microservice has been reported to be able to scale services better and in order to achieve this services must be in form of loosely coupled. internet of things must be considered and included in designing service system today in order to build seamless service system. however, designing and combining internet of things with service system is not straight forward as it will introduce complexity to the system especially if it is not designed and planned properly. it is also hard to scale a service system if it is in form of centralized and tightly coupled manner. therefore, it is important to understand how this problem will effect the service system and find the solution to overcome this problem. promise theory has been looked as a possibility to be adopted in designing a loosely coupled microservice system for internet of things. this paper is about the preliminary studies and works that have been done in using promise theory to understand and designing loosely coupled microservice architecture for internet of things.","internet of things, microservice, promise theory",,"ahmad tarmizi abdul ghani faculty of information science and technology universiti kebangsaan malaysia 43600 bangi selangor, malaysia atag@ukm.edu.my mohamad shanudin zakaria faculty of information science and technology universiti kebangsaan malaysia 43600 bangi selangor, malaysia msz@ukm.edu.my",
109,A New Diversification Measurement Technique In  Metaheuristics For Vehicle Routing Problems,"this article presents a technique to measure the diversification effect of local search moves in metaheuristic algorithms for solving capacitated vehicle routing problems. the diversification values calculated through this technique can be used to modify the algorithms, pick the best neighborhoods in each move and improve the searching process to find the optimal solution. this technique may be implemented to a wide variety of metaheuristics. it is shown that metaheuristic algorithms for vehicle routing problems may be examined efficiently and improved with this technique. moreover, we examine the solutions for different instances produced by this technique on simulated annealing algorithm and we interpret the relations between the optimal solution and the diversification scores.","vehicle routing, metaheuristics","We have presented a new technique that measures diversification effect of metaheuristic algorithms for capacitated vehicle routing problems. The problem is solved using simulated annealing algorithm with different NS moves. It is obtained that diversification measure is an important factor for the success of metaheuristic algorithms and NS methods. In addition, this technique may help to make decisions for NS selection or to evaluate metaheuristic algorithms. We propose a new technique that is able to calculate diversification scores and analyze metaheuristic algorithms with hybrid mechanisms according to these results. These scores show us how diversified the algorithm is. This ability of the algorithm can be used as a criteria to decide whether the diversification in the algorithm is appropriate or not, and whether the algorithm needs to be improved. Our technique may be useful in measuring the diversification in the algorithms and can be a very important indicator for metaheuristics. It can be used to improve the success of the metaheuristics by helping to choose the best neighborhood structure in the next moves. It can also help in decision making about the combination of two or more neighborhood structures to be used as hybrid approaches. The relationship between the diversity score and the objective function value is tested for different NSs. The objective function in different problems with different algorithms has been observed from the experiments and the value of the objective function is seen to improve as the diversity score increases. The algorithms with high diversification scores are observed to be more successful and achieve better results. It is also as seen from the results that using two different NS methods in order to increase the diversification effect, may not always increase the diversification effect more than using a single NS method. For this reason, diversification scores need to be measured for decision making about which NS mechanisms to use. We finally state that the measurement of diversification scores in algorithms can provide very useful results in improving the algorithms and we will focus on the usage of this technique for different combinatorial problems in the future.","muge acar and onur kaya industrial engineering department anadolu university eskisehir, turkey msoyuoz@anadolu.edu.tr, onur_kaya@anadolu.edu.tr",

With advances in force torque sensor technology and also programming techniques it is now possible to achieve improved performance results for the polishing process at the same time reducing the lead times. In this paper a six axis robotic system with a force torque sensor for high precision extrusion die molds has been shown to producing results better than the bench mark requirements as well as reducing the lead time considerably. However the research has shown that the polishing process of the co extrusion die could not be polished a 100%. Final finishing will still need to be completed by manual process.

113,Assessment Of Workers’ Aptitude Toward Assembly Tasks In  Production Cells Based On The Five Factor Model Of,"over the past 30 years, cell production or cellular manufacturing has become an integral part of lean manufacturing systems, many organizations have applied cell production concepts in manufacturing and service processes. in a cell production system, factory floor labor is arranged into semi-autonomous and multi-skilled teams, or work cells, who manufacture complete products or complex components. properly trained and implemented cells are more flexible and responsive than traditional mass-production lines. successful implementation of cell production can achieve significant improvements in product quality, scheduling, space utilization, control of operations and employee morale. academics and practitioners have paid a lot of attention to cell production system design problems, such as the best groupings for products, parts, or machine clusters. some efforts have also been made toward selecting tools, jigs, and fixtures, determining process flow, determining cell capacity and selection of equipment. however, it has been reported that most of the problems faced by companies implementing cell production system were related to people, not technical issues. as surveyed by several researchers, implementation of cell production is not simply a rearrangement of the factory layout; it is a complex reorganization that involves organizational and human aspects. as major studies have put their emphasis on technical factors of cell production systems, there is a singular absence of articles investigating the impact of human factors on production cells. this is because human related issues are typically difficult to quantify. although there are some literatures identifying and dealing with how human factors affect production cells, almost all of them were conducted based on questionnaires analysis or case studies. there are few researches that examine quantitatively human factors’ impact in cell production systems. we have made a series of experimental studies to investigate the impact of human factors. one of our previous studies has shown that both workers and their experience (learning effect) have significant impacts on the productivity of production cells, the impact of these two factors accounts for 67.01% and 19.63% respectively. as two-thirds of variance of the productivity were decided by workers, it is very important to measure workers’ aptitude and assign the right workers in the right place in order to implement cell production systems successfully. in this paper, we put our emphasis on measuring the workers’ aptitudes that significantly affect performance of production cells, and make several new contributions about the cell production research through the following examinations: (1) different from most of previous researches that applied questionnaire survey or case study methods, this paper applied the experimental study method. we designed and conducted a cell production experiment, and used the assembly time to measure quantitatively productivity of production cells. (2) in order to measure the workers’ personality, we applied a short form of five factor personality questionnaire (ffpq-50). ffpq-50 is a 50-item questionnaire that measures the workers’ five super traits: extraversion, attachment, controlling, emotionality, and playfulness. a principal component 253",,,"personality yanwen dong cluster of science and technology fukushima university kanayagawa no.1, fukushima city, 960-1296 japan dong@sss.fukushima-u.ac.jp extended",

116,An Integrated Inventory And Routing For The Single-Period  Problems With Deterministic Demand,"this paper considers the problem of managing inventory and routing problems in a two-stage supply chain system under a vendor managed inventory (vmi) policy. vmi is an inventory management policy in which the supplier assumes the responsibility of maintaining the inventory at the customers while ensuring that they will not run out of stock. the delivery times to the customers are no longer agreed in response to customers' orders; instead the supplier indicates when each delivery takes place. under the vmi policy, the planning is proactive as it is based on the available information rather than reactive to retailers' orders. thus, in this research, we assumed that the demand at each customer is stationary and the warehouse is implementing a vmi. the objective of this research is to minimize the inventory and the transportation costs of the customers for a two-stage supply chain system. the problem is to identify the delivery quantities, delivery times and routes to the customers for the single-period deterministic inventory routing problem (sp-dirp) system. as a result, a linear mixed-integer program is established for the solutions of the sp-dirp problem. some sample tests have indicated that the integrated approach for the sp- dirp problem provides good result.",single-period,,"mohd kamarul irwan abdul rahim, rosman iteng and mohd akhir ahmad school of technology management and logistics universiti utara malaysia 06010 uum sintok, kedah, malaysia. mk.irwan@uum.edu.my, rosman@uum.edu.my, makhir@uum.edu.my",

119,Process Flow Modelling And Optimization Of A Foundry  Layout In Zimbabwe Using Simulation,"foundry industry technologies have evolved over the years largely due to rapid changes in technology resulting in complexities that require careful planning and organization. materials in the foundry industry pass through various stages and a number of factors, ranging from preparation of charges, materials handling and routing, furnace and production scheduling influence the process flows through these interconnected stages. such a complex network of activities pose some challenges to companies that traditionally employ manual means of production planning. research was carried out at one of zimbabwe’s largest foundry companies, prompted by the company’s failure to produce affordable grinding media on time and in turn forcing their main customers to prefer cheaper imports. the work study revealed that the company’s key challenges were in materials handling and transportation distances through the various workstations. this research focused on modelling the process flows using simulation with the aim of optimizing and reorganizing the foundry layout to reduce production costs, improve productivity and enhance efficiency. the resulting model of the optimal layout and process flows has been adopted and the company is gradually regaining its competitiveness and market share.","foundry, layout, modelling, optimization","Appropriate layout of machine tools in any manufacturing environment is critical, more so for a foundry where each workstation in the system is dependent on the others. The flow of materials through the system and the processing thereof, increasingly become complex in a setup where there are several units interconnected. The case study company has several such units that are interconnected in the processing and production of grinding media for the mining industry in Zimbabwe. Their traditional customers were preferring cheaper imports which were readily availed when needed but this company was failing to meet these needs coupled with failure to match prices for the imported products. A number of changes were proposed such as the relocation of the weighbridge, more direct process paths and flows between interacting workstations as well as adding more machines at workstations that were observed to have consistent queues. There were marked decreases in processing, waiting and transportation times within the reorganized layout, while the distances of the rerouted process paths decreased from 467.7m to 198.3m, which is expected to translate to reductions in product costs and improvements in yield and process efficiency. The manufacturing throughput time correspondingly decreased by about 58% compared to the original layout. Bottlenecks observed during the work study were identical to those obtained from the simulation runs and experiments, thereby validating the models. Although the company has gradually been implementing the proposed changes, there has been some slight increase in customers placing orders for grinding balls. This is however expected to improve as all the changes are completely implemented, coupled with the functional CCM. While this research contributed to resolving some of the challenges faced by the company in developing an optimized foundry layout, the company should consider investing in more equipment and technology such as the Andon Light System for detecting manufacturing defects, commercial version of the Arena simulation software, AGVs for ease of transportation of materials through the system as well as the use of fuzzy logic for monitoring and control of machine tools at workstations.

120,Newsvendor Based Pricing Model For Liner Shipping With  Sailing Speed Optimization,"we study the problem of freight pricing using pricing break points with quantity discounts offered by liner shipping services to freight forwarders in maritime transportation. we propose a model that maximizes the liner shipping and the forwarders profits. the forwarders book slots on the vessels for every trip (usually weekly) in a quantity that is encouraged by a pricing scheme proposed by the liner services with a single breakpoint. the booking is done before the forwarders have an accurate idea about their transport demands, and therefore they model it using probabilistic representations. since container transportation services cannot be stored and given the stochastic nature of demand, the studied problem can be considered as a newsvendor type problem. moreover, we consider an accurate formulation of the cost function of the liner service in which the sailing speed is a decision variable. the model is an integrated decentralized two-stage optimization model where the forwarders constitute the first stage and the liner company the second, and in which the optimal decisions taken by one stage are taken into account in the optimization of the decisions of the other stage. a numerical application is provided to show the effectiveness of the model.","newsvendor model, liner shipping, freight forwarders, optimization","In conclusion, it was pointed out the importance of optimizing the profits for container transportation services provided by the liner shipping companies. The field of maritime shipping generally is not given the concern it deserves in the perspective of financial profitability, while many reviewers and researchers considered its environmental aspect. On the other hand, some studies considered mathematical optimization models for free shipping quantity orders determination for online businesses. However, it should be concerned the importance of optimizing the liner shipping services companies profits and costs. Indeed, under the QD scheme, the total optimal line profit (𝛱𝛱𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿) increased by 2.6 % which is 310,100 USD. For other not non-optimal total line profits (𝛱𝛱𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿), under the QD scheme, when the vessel speeds (𝑉𝑉) increase, the liner service achieved profits that reached 2.9%, which is 330,400 USD, this is at maximum vessel speed 𝑉𝑉 = 28 𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑓𝑓𝑘𝑘𝐶𝐶. Forwarders are benefiting from this scheme also, since any forwarder's optimal quantity to be ordered fits the condition: 𝑄𝑄𝑖𝑖 ≥ 𝑄𝑄𝑑𝑑1will get a discount in the freight rate. Moreover, indirect forwarders benefit is when the line minimizes its total cost, which may have an effect on the line’s freight rate 𝑊𝑊0. In this study, more attention is paid to the decision variables that really affect the whole liner shipping services’ profit, which are the freight rates and the sailing speed. It also considered the effect on the maritime supply chain partners, namely the forwarders and shippers. In other words, if a liner shipping company guarantees encouraging pricing schemes for its forwarders and shippers and suitable sailing speed, then this liner shipping company is winning the bid and getting the customers’ loyalty, since that forwarders or shippers are frequent customers with frequent, or at least periodic, demand to ship","walaa ishnaineh industrial engineering and engineering management department university of sharjah 27272 sharjah, uae u00045907@sharjah.ac.ae, walaa_13410@hotmail.com ali cheaitou seam research group and industrial engineering and engineering management department university of sharjah 27272 sharjah, uae acheaitou@sharjah.ac.ae, ali.cheaitou@centraliens.net","References

121,Waste Heat And Energy Recovery System From Smelter Offgas For A Platinum Processing Plant,"most mineral processing companies are energy intensive especially if smelting is used in extraction. after processing, the energy is correspondingly dissipated as heat and toxic gases, requiring stringent controls for sustainability and safety. in recent years, southern africa has grappled with power shortages resulting in the scaling down of company operations. increases in manufacturing activities demand for more energy but this has evidently outstripped supply due to the depletion of natural resources. mineral processing industries are probably the worst affected due to fluctuations in world metal prices. these challenges require sustainable production strategies to remain in business. this research was carried out at a platinum processing company in zimbabwe which uses smelting in extractive metallurgy, consuming millions of dollars in energy but also dissipating this as heat and furnace exhaust gases. the focus of the research was on finding ways to turn these challenges into opportunities by recovering the heat and using it for other purposes. a waste heat and energy recovery system was designed to work in conjunction with the smelters and electrostatic precipitator. the proposed system is expected to increase furnace efficiency by 8.5% with an anticipated output of 1.033 mw and an overall plant efficiency of 22.7%.","energy, heat, recovery, smelting","Mineral processing companies that utilize smelters in their extractive processes not only consume a lot of energy but also dissipate proportionate and corresponding amounts in smelter off-gas and heat. Efforts have been made by many researchers to capture the toxic gases, mainly SO2 while some researched on how to recover and reuse the heat generated and dissipated by the smelters. Due to the dangers involved and the anticipated costs for the former, focus has been more on the latter. In this research, a waste heat and energy recovery system that consists of thermodynamic equipment such as heat exchangers, economizer, regenerator, evaporator and radial turbine was proposed and designed for use in conjunction with the Hatch-Elkem 13.5 MVA furnace and Pierce-Smith converters at the case study PGM processing company in Zimbabwe. Based on the design and calculations carried out, the anticipated heat energy recovery output was 1.033 MW with an overall plant efficiency of 22.7%, estimated equipment cost of $ 430,190 and a return on investment of 0.438 years, based on the annual energy savings from the recovery. The system is also anticipated to be sustainable and environmentally friendly as there will be no emissions to the atmosphere from the closed loop system. However, further work is required to incorporate control systems to monitor inlet and outlet temperatures, pressure, flow rates and for detecting leakages and clogging. Acknowledgements The authors are grateful to the platinum mining and processing company for allowing access to their operations to carry out this research and indeed hopeful that the proposed waste heat and energy recovery system proposed, will be adopted for the benefit of the company in the long run.","wilson r. nyemba department of mechanical engineering science, faculty of engineering and the built environment, university of johannesburg, auckland park 2006, johannesburg, south africa nyemba@yahoo.com innocent mushanguri, simon chinguwa department of mechanical engineering, university of zimbabwe, p o box mp 167, mount pleasant, harare, zimbabwe mushanguriinnocent@gmail.com, chinguwa@gmail.com charles mbohwa professor of sustainability engineering, department of quality and operations management & vice dean for research and innovation, faculty of engineering and the built environment, university of johannesburg, auckland park 2006, johannesburg, south africa cmbohwa@uj.ac.za",
122,Tying Industry 4.0 To Existing Research   What The Past Reveals On Successfully Adopting Industry 4.0?,,,,,
123,Conceptualization Of A New Product Development  Framework For Eddy Current Braking Systems For Heavy,"one of the most critical requirements for safety in vehicles is the availability of reliable braking systems. most heavy vehicles in zimbabwe employ the conventional hydraulic braking system. however changes and improvements in technology have seen the introduction of retarders that make use of magnets and eddy currents. the new technology is friction free but still deemed expensive and thus not yet readily acceptable to vehicle manufacturers for fears of reliability and cost. hydraulic brakes are equally expensive in the long run owing to maintenance and frequent replacement of brake pads and rotors, particularly in zimbabwe where the road infrastructure has deteriorated significantly over the years. a case study was carried out at a zimbabwean company which specializes in the sales, service and backup of scania heavy vehicles, with a special focus on the braking systems. the aim of the research was to conceptualize and compare various options and concepts of the eddy current retarders. analysis for the chosen option were made for reliability and efficiency using an industrial engineering approach, with the objective of supplementing hydraulic brakes and recommending the sustainable use of such technology to the company and thereby dispelling any fears of reliability and cost.","brakes, conceptualization, eddy current, heavy vehicles","This research was motivated by observations made at a company that specializes in the service and backup support for heavy vehicles. The frequent servicing and replacement of hydraulic friction brakes purportedly owing to the damaged road infrastructure in Zimbabwe required innovative solutions to cut down on the costs for maintenance. Based on the developed concept for electromagnetic brakes, 3 concepts were analyzed and the chosen option was developed further to incorporate positive attributes of the other concepts coupled with improvements leading to the proposed frictionless electromagnetic retarder that employs permanent magnets mounted on the transmission shaft of the vehicle to supplement the hydraulic friction brakes as well as reduce the amount of wear on the brake pads and their frequent replacement. Analysis of the proposed design showed that it would be able to provide sufficient braking torque to control a heavy vehicle such as a bus or truck. The estimated cost of the proposed retarder was $1,995.00, a reasonable amount that can adequately be covered by the savings on maintenance costs. However, further work will be required to develop the proposed design into a prototype that can be experimented on to determine practical performance on different terrains and road conditions. Acknowledgements The authors are grateful to the service company for allowing access to their operations to carry out this research and indeed hopeful that the company will adopt the proposed electromagnetic retarder for their heavy vehicles.","vehicles in zimbabwe wilson r. nyemba department of mechanical engineering science, faculty of engineering and the built environment, university of johannesburg, auckland park 2006, johannesburg, south africa nyemba@yahoo.com chris pote, tauyanashe chikuku department of mechanical engineering, university of zimbabwe, p o box mp 167, mount pleasant, harare, zimbabwe cpote25@yahoo.com, tauyanashec@yahoo.co.uk charles mbohwa professor of sustainability engineering, department of quality and operations management & vice dean for research and innovation, faculty of engineering and the built environment, university of johannesburg, auckland park 2006, johannesburg, south africa cmbohwa@uj.ac.za",
124,Multi-Criteria Decision Making: The Case Of Large And  Distinct Decision Makers,"this paper considers a multi-criteria decision making (mcdm) problem where a set of alternatives are to be evaluated or ranked. however, unlike in a traditional mcdm approach, each alternative is evaluated by a distinct group of decision makers who are different from those evaluating the other competing alternatives. in addition, the decision makers for each alternative are large (in hundreds and above). we propose a sampling based modeling technique to transform this special type of mcdm problem into a traditional mcdm format. following this, the sampling distributions of the ranks of the alternatives are displayed with boxplot to aid decision making. a numerical example showing the effectiveness of the proposed approach is presented.",decision making,"In this paper, a new technique that extends the traditional MCDM approach to decision making was developed to handle ranking and selection decision making problems with large and distinct decision makers. The approach provides a new way of analyzing ranking and selection problems where opinions are elicited from a large populace such as customer service evaluation of competing companies, and product selection based on online customer reviews. A characteristic of such problems is that, often surveyed respondents have an experience with only one alternative making them unable to comment on other alternatives. This character of distinctness of the decision makers render the traditional MCDM ranking/selection techniques not useful since general MCDM approaches require that each decision maker evaluate every alternative. The proposed approach transforms this unique problem onto the traditional MCDM format for easier analysis and interpretation by imagining the ranking performed by a randomly chosen decision maker. This approach therefore makes it possible to apply MCDM methods to problems where competing alternatives are evaluated by the larger public, such as in market surveys and product reviews by customers. To most organizations and industries, the proposed technique offers a convenient tool to analyze surveys on customer satisfaction and product performance in relation to their competitors. More so, the bootstrap sampling method underpinning the proposed technique helps ensure the final result is a true reflection of the larger customer population. The applicability of the proposed technique was demonstrated using a real-world data on service performance of mobile network providers in Ghana from the perspective of customers. The example demonstrate the capability of the proposed technique to generate ordinal ranking for the alternatives, as well as put into perspective the real gap in performance between competing alternatives. On the overall service performance of mobile network providers in Ghana from the perspective of customers, it is seen that VODAFONE ranks number 1, followed by TIGO, which is closely followed by AIRTEL. MTN and GLO come number 4 and 5 respectively. Given the competitive and fast changing nature of the industry in terms of market share, the result therefore is an indication that MTN and GLO need to improve upon their service performances.","anthony afful-dadzie department of operations management and information systems university of ghana business school lg 78, accra, ghana aafful-dadzie@ug.edu.gh eric afful-dadzie department of operations management and information systems university of ghana business school lg 78, accra, ghana eafful-dadzie@ug.edu.gh",

126,Capturing Complexity And Interdependencies In  Environmental Production Networks,"the objectives of the circular economy require manufacturers not only to shift from linear supply chain approaches towards inter-company production networks, but also to trace all flows of material and energy within the network as well as at its boundaries with the natural environment. research on production networks has been limited in that studies focus on a single or a small set of production phases or production methods or that only linear cause-effect-relationship are being studied. consequently, feedback and feedforward loops are insufficiently captured in these partial studies. this paper closes the gap by conceptualizing production networks that include the entire product lifecycle including the resulting complex structures and interdependencies. the paper introduces a framework with standardized modules (modelled as input-output systems) that can be combined into alternative product-independent production networks. depending on the requirements modules of different granularity are presented. the paper then applies the framework to the case of car manufacturing and recycling. the merits of this innovative research are twofold. such a material and energy flow framework was previously not available, thus the research promises original results. furthermore, the results can serve as excellent input for companies in their planning and assessment of environmentally oriented production networks.","sustainability, traceability, information",,"sabine baumann college of management, information, technology jade university friedrich-paffrath-str. 101 26389 wilhelmshaven, germany sabine.baumann@jade-hs.de christoph wunck college of management, information, technology jade university friedrich-paffrath-str. 101 26389 wilhelmshaven, germany wunck@jade-hs.de",

It is very clear the need to find other means of utilizing about 90 percent of the waste disposed via landfills in South Africa. Different approach has been suggested to handle this problem. In fact, waste and its maintenance are costlier than what is assumed at face value. A detailed analysis of the cost of waste makes any nation have a rethink on the generation of waste. Therefore, it is imperative that wastes need to be managed properly. If this is not done, waste that are not eliminated, reduced or recycled will continually have a negative impact on the economy and the social aspect of any nation and at large, the environment where we all live in. 382",jemilugba olufunto tolulope vuyo mavumengwanab and charles mbohwa c a department of biotechnology and food technology university of johannesburg south africa. jolufunto@gmail.com b department of biotechnology and food technology university of johannesburg south africa.vuyom@ac.uj.ac.za c faculty of engineering and the built environment university of johannesburg south africa cmbohwa@uj.ac.za,"References

129,An Exploratory Critical Review On Assistive Robotics  Applied To Autism Spectrum: Employability Challenges,"robotics has been applied to assist autistic people with different approaches and therapy goals. in this paper, we describe the results of an exploratory analysis of research approaches, methods and paradigms that frequently are used and reported. our critical perspective seeks links to the social responsibility in terms of inclusive employability and equity. we have found that research is geared towards robotic assistance to therapists typically to improve relationship skills. the use of robots, moreover, implies that specialists are not necessarily present all the time so it is essential that autistic people accept the robot as a supporting technology. we conclude that is common to find research that focus on experimental design with a robot action in scheduled moments, physically controlled when people are exposed. in addition, experiments with robotics applications in virtual worlds interconnected with “physical world” under a cyber-physical concept are not frequently considered. however, evidence of validated progress in clinical terms is not conclusive, so this seems to be a real limitation for employability increase of autistic people. also, research with rigorous methods aimed at obtaining robust clinical results is a great opportunity, especially if a strong link is made in increasing the employability of autistic people.","robotics, autism, assistive robotics","and Future Works According with Diehl J, Schmitt L. M., Villano M, Crowell C.R. (2012), Begum M., Serna R.W., Yanco H.A. (2016) and Cho Seong-Jin & Ahn Dong Hyun (2016), we found that the purpose of many of the investigations is oriented towards the study of “responses to robots or robot-like characteristics, eliciting behavior, modeling, teaching, or practicing skills and providing feedback or encouragement, that is, the use of a robot as purveyor of behavioral contingencies or social support during an activity” (Diehl J., 2012). However, in this work we also find a fifth teleological category: the purpose of stimulating the human-human relationship with the robot as a linking instrument (Costa S. et al, 2015; Costescu C.A., Vanderborght B. & David D.O., 2015; Sang-Seok Yun, JongSuk Choi & Sung-Kee Park, 2016). In this fifth teleological category, there is the intensive use of virtualization technologies and greater application of machine learning to adapt to a specific ludic objective. We also conclude that is common to find research that focus on experimental design with a robot action in scheduled moments, physically controlled when people are exposed. However, evidence of validated advances in clinical terms is still incipient, so this seems to be a real limitation for employability increase of autistic people. In the future, research with rigorous methods aimed at obtaining evidence-based clinical results is a great opportunity, especially if a strong link is made in increasing the employability of autistic people. In this sense, the quasi-experimental exploratory method commonly used must evolve towards proposals more oriented to the evidence based on clinical results with study of causality. Another great opportunity for research in the future is the use of virtual reality experience of autistic people in combination with an avatar of a physical robot. This is an innovative way to search continuous and real time exposure to therapy protocols without therapist physical supervision but virtual, taking into account that experiments with robotics applications in virtual worlds interconnected with “physical world” under a cyber-physical concept are not frequently considered.","eldon glen caldwell marín department of industrial engineering university of costa rica san josé, costa rica eldon.caldwell@ucr.ac.cr miguel cazorla university institute for computing research university of alicante alicante, spain mcazorla@dtic.ua.es mauricio zamora smart, lean & cognitive systems lab. university of costa rica san josé, costa rica mauricio.zamora@ucr.ac.cr josé garcía and jorge azorin-lopez industrial informatics and computer networks research group university of alicante alicante, spain jgr@dtic.ua.es, jazorin@dtic.ua.es",
130,Logistics Transportation Integration To Import Steel Slabs. A  Case Study.,"in recent years, material imports in the steel industry has increased for several reasons, therefore efforts have focused on optimizing port logistics processes to increase their efficiency. the steel slab is a semi- finished steel product of rectangular section, obtained by continuous casting processes for its use in rolling mills to produce rolled steel rolls. on the other hand, the port of brownsville represents for the company under study the main point for the importation of steel slabs. due the demand growth of this material in the last years and the reduction of space in the closest yards to the unloading zone inside the port, the management of the material handling is indispensable. the case study presented on this article aims to reduce costs in their logistic processes in the importation of steel slabs starting on the material unload of the ship to the load of rail wagons that go to plant. based on the methodology for the analysis of logistics processes a reduction of more than 30% of logistics costs was calculated.","steel slab, logistics, material handling",,"teresa verduzco-garza, jorge fernando fonseca sánchez, josé guadalupe olvera hernández, bryan raúl rangel martínez. division of engineering & technologies, department of engineering universidad de monterrey san pedro garza garcía, nl, 66238, mexico teresa.verduzco@udem.edu",
131,Multi Product Multi Period Network Design For Reverse  Logistics,"waste management in health institutions has become important in recent years because of the increase in population and industrialization. waste generated from health institutions has risks for human health and the environment. therefore, this paper presents a reverse logistics optimization for waste collection and disposal in turkish health institutions. a multiperiod, multitype product waste reverse logistics network was designed to build an effective collection and disposal system for waste generated from health institutions in turkey. a mixed integer linear programming model was developed to determine the optimal number and locations of the facilities for efficient waste management in health care by minimizing the total cost. in this context, a sensitivity analysis was conducted to examine the impact of the incremental changes of waste amounts on the optimal reverse logistics network. according to increasing waste amounts, the numbers of changes in facilities are analyzed and strategies are specified.","reverse logistics, optimization, medical waste, domestic waste","Waste management in health institutions has become more important in the contemporary world. The waste arising from health institutions generates serious risks due to the increasing number of facilities. Also, in Turkey, the health sector has developed in recent years owing to the increase in population and industrialization.

134,Decreasing Ambulance Response Time Through An Optimal Base  Location,an important effort of academic research has been realized to improve ambulance response time (the time between the receipt of a call at the dispatch center and the arrival of the ﬁrst emergency response vehicle at the scene). this study recommends the application of lean transportation concepts to achieve shorter ambulance response times. the approach considers the reduction of the time required to travel distance in excess waste by placing ambulances in optimal locations through mathematical modeling. in this project this is applied to the monterrey metropolitan operations of the mexican red cross. results of the application are provided.,"waste elimination, platinum ten, golden hour","and recommendations As previously mentioned, an important issue in current EMS operations concerns the improvement of ambulance response time. This study recommends the application of Lean Transportation concepts to achieve better ambulance response times. The approach considers the reduction of the time required to travel distance in excess waste by placing ambulances in optimal locations through mathematical modeling. In particular, the DSM model is applied to the Monterrey metropolitan operations of the Mexican Red Cross. The results of the model imply an increase in the number of required ambulances. In addition, it also suggests new locations for them. After reviewing the recommendations, the management of the institution decided to implement a pilot program considering the limited resources available at the end of year 2016. The idea behind this move was to have further results to justify an increase in the operations budget for improving response time during year 2017. Further work related to this study includes the determination of the number and location of ambulances during holidays and summer. The same scheme is also considered to be used as an aid for strategic medium range planning. Acknowledgements The authors thankfully acknowledge to the Mexican Red Cross operations located in the metropolitan area of Monterrey for providing the information required to carry out this project such as the emergency call database, the location of the base stations as well as the feedback provided regarding operative matters.","bernardo villarreal, edgar-marco-aurelio granda-gutierrez, samantha lankenau ana-cristina bastidas & andrea montalvo universidad de monterrey san pedro garza garcía, n.l., méxico 66238",
135,"Group Modeling-Building: The Environment, Culture  And Work Conditions Impact On The Process","systems thinking is a conceptual language that encourages professionals into using ""feedback loop"" thinking rather than mere linear thinking. in order to analyze a problem, a process of building a model of the interrelationship between the various variables of the system took place in an israeli factory, in a country of mixture cultures and social backgrounds. the process of building a model involved many participants of different positions in the factory, composing a diverse group with varied inputs. since the participants in the model building process were chosen from various levels within the company, they were also from diverse backgrounds in terms of their cultural background, socio-economic status and their work position. these impact their way of thinking and their opinions on the problem. it is therefore vital for research management teams to acknowledge these differences between group members in order to understand the contradictory information that may come up from different parts of the group. this variety in problem conceptualization may also arise in knowledge elicitation by using both the group model building process and personal conversations. revealing this kind of cultural mixture allows a continuous improvement process of knowledge elicitation through this model building process.","feedback loops, applied statistics",,"sadia rina department of industrial and management engineering shenkar college of engineering and design ramat-gan, israel rinasadia@gmail.com",
136,Management (Ieom)  Implementation Of Problem-Based Learning (Pbl) In Chemical Thermodynamics,": this work is focused on the strategies used to incorporate pbl in chemical thermodynamics course taught at the chemical engineering department at the yanbu industrial college, saudi arabia. the course was redesigned to map course learning outcomes with the learning objectives. from a dominant traditional teacher-centered course, a framework was developed to introduce student- centered learning. in the student-centred learning section, pbl was incorporated in the 10th week of the course where intention was to cover most course learning outcomes. as a starter, the pbl formed only 13% of the total teaching and learning hours for the course. the multiple-solution problem encompassed the use of energy transformation to economically and efficiently transport natural gas from far areas to populated cities. it was found that pbl could be used as an effective education strategy for a typical chemical engineering course albeit teacher-centred approach could not be eliminated completely.",,that transporting gas by using large size compressor was the preferred option over distributing gas in cylinders. They justified their choice owing to large populations in both cities would incur huge costs for latter choice. 2. Only one group performed the sizing calculations accurately by taking non-ideal gas behaviour into account at high pressures. Some groups also made mistakes in unit conversions. The groups differed in choosing the type of compressor. Two groups suggested reciprocating compressor while the rest came up with the idea of using centrifugal compressor. However they did not justify their selection. 3. Regarding safety and environmental issues most of the groups touched these topics generally with no,"course at the yanbu industrial college, saudi arabia i. mustafa department of chemical engineering technology, yanbu industrial college, saudi arabia *corresponding author. email: ahmedi@rcyci.edu.sa","References

139,Revenue Structure Of Mobile Banking: A System Dynamics  Model,"technology advancements during recent years have created new opportunities for offering new banking services which might have great impacts on decreasing banks’ costs and increasing their non-interest income earned from the fees of banking services. but, banks have always been wondering if these new services would be adopted or accepted by the customers? public adoption of a new technology often takes years and depends on its success in the development and continuous use by people. this research intends to employ a system approach to analyzing the dynamics of developing new banking services focusing specifically on mobile banking. here, a dynamic model is developed and simulated by system dynamics (sd) approach considering related theories extracted from the literature, identified factors, and influencing feedback for better understanding the existent mechanisms. the simulation results of four scenarios are presented. results showed that increasing advertisement and r&d budget would not be useful enough for the sustainable growth of mobile banking transactions and their revenue in long term. in fact, improving the set of factors influencing the customers’ intention of using the technology can most likely make people accept the technology and increase its use and the revenue earned from banking fees and other charges.","e-banking, mobile banking, system dynamics",,"mahdi bastan department of industrial engineering & management systems amirkabir university of technology tehran, iran bastan@aut.ac.ir reza ramazani khorshid-doust department of industrial engineering & management systems amirkabir university of technology tehran, iran ramazani@aut.ac.ir saeid delshad sisi department of industrial engineering clemson university clemson, usa s.delsha@g.clemson.edu sareh akbarpour department of industrial engineering eyvanekey university eyvanekey, iran akbarpour@eyc.ac.ir","References
